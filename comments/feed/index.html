		<description><![CDATA[Hi.

Thank you for bringing an easy way to install fglrx drivers. Unfortunately recently i&#039;ve been having a specific problem with the fglrx drivers and AMD GPU in general. My computer freezes as soon as it tries to load X server (black screen, monitor shuts down and computer reboots). This thing happens when i have installed 13.xx fglrx drivers or when using 3.13.x kernel with open source drivers .

At least when i&#039;m using fglrx drivers this problem goes away when i add &quot;nomodeset&quot; to Grub. The stupid thing is that there are no errors in log files (upon request i would provide needed log files).

		<title>Comment on Unterstanding the nvidia driver process by Andreas Klafft</title>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all I want to thank NVIDIA, that we still have working drivers. Since a longer time I am working with these drivers, also on 13.1. I do not like the politic of NVIDIA, how they make the drivers. I also do not like the competitive project of Nouveau. These drivers do not work for me and since a couple of time they are in a development state. For my graphic adapter I see no improvement. So in my opinion there is a need for a better teamwork between Suse and NVIDIA. The question is how to reach it. I think, you can respect and accept the  proprietarity of the driver, because NVIDIA does not want to give you all the secrets about their graphic chips. And NVIDIA can support you with news in development. The drivers are free and who needs a NVIDIA driver, when he does not have a NVIDIA graphic adapter. So you can give info about new SUSE releases and NVIDIA about new GA&#039;s or chips. With some info and hiding the secrets it would be a nice teamwork.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sankar, thanks for your recommendations. There is no bible or koran included, Bibletime is the tool to study bible, Koran in Russian is available in one of their repositories. FBReader and other ebook readers are also included that can be used to read any kind of texts that may fancy you :)

Cheers
