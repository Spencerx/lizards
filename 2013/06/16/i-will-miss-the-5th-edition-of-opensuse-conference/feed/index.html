		<description><![CDATA[Dude, that really sucks, we&#039;ll miss you lots and lots... For next year you should book the trip as soon as the location is known ;-)

Btw SUSE didn&#039;t pick the oSC dates, the local team did. Of course, not having oSC at the same time as the openSUSE Summit is smart, but I believe they simply wanted the event to happen earlier in the year for planning and availability-of-team-members reasons.]]></description>
