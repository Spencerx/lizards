		<description><![CDATA[Major rant ahead :)

It&#039;s a shame that flgrx-legacy is not supported anymore (or the other way around legacy does not support the latest Xorg). It was unfortunately the only reliable driver for my notebook. 

The trouble with the Open Source radeon driver is that it randomly crashes the system during and after video playback. The screen simply turns blank and nothing is responsive anymore. The radeon driver used to work reliably about 2 years ago. But that&#039;s the way Open Source software development works. Progress means introducing new problems. The same with the touchpad driver that doesn&#039;t work anymore since my upgrade to OpenSUSE 12.3 and also screen brightness cannot be controlled anymore (used to work OK in previous versions).

I exclusively use OpenSUSE for my every day needs since 2004. Every major upgrade of OpenSUSE brought problems that more or less fade away over the course of a whole year due to maintenance updates. Things that used to work on the same device suddenly glitch or break completely. Graphics, touchpad, WLAN connectivity, standby mode and so on.

In some instances I&#039;d love to send bug reports. Trouble is that the KDE built-in bug report facilities always fail with different excuses and most of the time it crashes for itself and there is no bug report function for the bug report function.

And nope, I rarely feel like jumping through the hoops of going online to all these relevant bug tracking places for all these various projects, trying to think of what I actually did when that happened.

The problem with the fglrx-legacy incompatibility is that I am forced to either downgrade back to OpenSUSE 12.2 (which has its own set of quirks) or switch distributions and pick one with an older Xorg version. No real solution in long terms. My 4 years old trusted notebook is all of a sudden rendered almost unusable because of progress.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Depending on integrator work the result of AMD legacy chipset is varying a lot :-(

I&#039;ve absolutely no clue about the future of legacy against new xorg version ( wonder to know how Ubuntu will handle that for Mir :-) )]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have updated xorg to 1.14 ( with mesa 9.1) from the xorg repo. The 12.3 version doesn&#039;t exist so had to use factory. Also updated to 3.8.3 from kernel stable. So far, things appear stable.

Performance slightly improved over stock 12.3. I have radeon 4250. What I have noticed is that catalyst driver, even with highest powersave setting ( least performance) vastly outperforms the OSS radeon driver at the highest performance setting ! Not to mention, the OSS version doesn&#039;t seem to detect the 128M of (dedicated?) sideport memory that the vendor calls &quot;display cache&quot;.

It seems that the &#039;proprietary&#039; driver use is no longer an option (unless something changes such as unufied EGL in the future).]]></description>
