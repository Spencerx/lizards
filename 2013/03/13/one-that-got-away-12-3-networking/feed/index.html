		<description><![CDATA[I did a clean install and encountered the same problem- no networking was configured during installation so networkmanager was not even installed.

Also, the installer is buggy- if you tweak the packages during installation, it usually throws an error at the end but usually its OK. The error happened even with 12.2 but missing networkmanager was the big issue.

opensuse still installs a lot of extraneous packages, even after I specified it to not do so. I wish the installer would get better at this.]]></description>
