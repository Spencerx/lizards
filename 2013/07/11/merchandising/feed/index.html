		<description><![CDATA[hello my name is Juan Mariano Gregoret, I&#039;m from Argentina. I wanted to thank you for your products are very good and of excellent quality. The design is also excellent. I always recommend to my acquaintances their products, I am very satisfied. I wanted to ask if you have to send a free sample (shirt, hat, sticker or whatever you can) or a reminder of your brand, to also be able to advertise it in my country. It would be very grateful, and I&#039;m a follower! from already thank you very much. Best regards. Juan Mariano]]></description>
