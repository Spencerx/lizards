		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I have a question about progress.opensuse.org: I could not find a possibility to take over a task as an openSUSE contributor. It seems that you have to be in a special circle of people to become active there, in fact, all people in there seem to be employees of SUSE. That feels like a contradiction to what was emphasised earlier in the openSUSE community, which was that tasks should be explicitely open to non SUSE employed community members. Also it seems to be very micro managing, not sure if that is needed and applicable for an open source project. 

Or have you given up on trying to become an open source project or being community driven? This tool seems to be a step in the wrong direction for me.]]></description>
