		<description><![CDATA[@cliff: I&#039;m aware of the problem, that the wine dependency is not perfect.  But if it would have been easy, I would have fixed it already.  I addressed the problem in google groups (an alternative solution) https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/pipelight-maintainers/Xhx8O6roViY But it has not been accepted.  Today I received the answer on a question I posted some time ago, that I needed to work on this.  First trials look promising, but still need a lot of effort to get it out in the wild.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for this! My only problem with your package was that at first I didn&#039;t realize that I needed your wine package too. Once I switched wine packages, all was well. Perhaps you could make your pipelight package require your wine package if only your wine package will do.]]></description>
