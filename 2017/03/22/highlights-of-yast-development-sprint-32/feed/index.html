		<description><![CDATA[First, why not also have some of the system role screens during openSUSE installation?  Might be a decent idea.
=====
I am absolutely impressed by the work that is being done in Yast.

I recently installed 42.2 as a dual-boot test on my main machine and was immediately impressed by the improvements already made to the Yast installer for that version.

Slicker and better install experience!

This work you are currently doing is adding so much more to the install experience:  Much improved ease of use, more usefull options, much easier to understand for newcomers, and a strong professional feel.

Superb job, to the entire Yast team!

I am gratefull for your hard work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let us clarify something before this misleading comment confuses people: nothing has changed in that regard for openSUSE. It still offers both desktops with KDE being the default.

Your comment must be based on the screenshots on this post (since there is not a single mention to GNOME or KDE in the text). Please, take into account that the screenshots illustrating the new capabilities related to system roles and add-ons are SUSE Enterprise Linux (SLE) screenshots, no openSUSE ones. Basically because the add-ons and the system roles screens are not used during openSUSE installation. And SLE uses GNOME as default graphical environment, another thing that has not changed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice! Looking forward to the improved handling of Btrfs subvolumes. That should finally fix my openFATE here: https://features.opensuse.org/314606

Now if only my second old openFATE issue would be looked into as well: https://features.opensuse.org/314778 ;)]]></description>
