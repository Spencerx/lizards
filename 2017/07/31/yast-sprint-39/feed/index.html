		<description><![CDATA[We did have one for a while; it was mostly done by a community volunteer. But at some point he didn&#039;t have enough time anymore, and nobody volunteered to pick it up, so after a while it was too broken to be maintained as a side project, and we had to drop it.

But we had that discusssion a long time ago several times: What&#039;s the point in having yet another GUI toolkit that would do the same thing? We have text mode with ncurses and X11 with Qt. Mind that it&#039;s not KDE, it&#039;s pure Qt. Normal users will be hard pressed to even notice the difference between a Qt and a Gtk application. I don&#039;t see a tangible benefit (other than satisfying certain people&#039;s ego) in providing another graphical UI that just uses another GUI toolkit.

Back then (12+ years ago IIRC) the argument was &quot;but we found a volunteer willing to do it and to maintain it&quot;, but it showed that it&#039;s a lot more work than most people think. Even worse, it&#039;s ongoing work to do all the required maintenance because those toolkits keep introducing subtle changes all the time. Bit rot sets in quickly, and after a certain amount of bit rot, it becomes unusable.]]></description>

But may we expect a libyui-GTK version in the future or is it completed out of scope?]]></description>
