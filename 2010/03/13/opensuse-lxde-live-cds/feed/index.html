		<description><![CDATA[nice work but already installed but I have a few problems:
1 Dsl in networkmanager is not working in default, i had to download ppp,nscd,and rp-pppoe from another computer to make ir work(don&#039;t really know which one did the trick)
2 As said above autologin doesn&#039;t work will it when updated in 11.2?
3 resolution is not saved on logout, and i want a different one from default (fixed it installing sax and making an xorg.conf)
4 keyboard layout is not easily changeable(had to change it from hal policy files)
5 lxmusic is not working not even for the example file (I can&#039;t get the error right now but if you need it i&#039;ll get it later)
I also have 1 suggestion I think chromium should be used instead of firefox, as it is much lighter]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@LLR

Not have autologin is a choice due to a bug fixed on 11.3 and just backported to 11.2 (not yet published on repo), as soon it will be fixed we&#039;ll have autologin enabled, don&#039;t worry.

just for reference, here is the bug: https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=581477

the username and passwords are wrote on the page i linked for the download, so if you read, you&#039;ll probably not complain. From here http://en.opensuse.org/Derivatives#Unofficial_updated_LXDE_live_CDs i can infact read:

#  Built on openSUSE 11.2 with latest LXDE.
# Username root with NO password
# Username linux with NO password 

@BigBen

the iso can be easly improved,  just waiting for suggestions

@goek
This is what i need to know, i can fix several things, for example, i didn&#039;t realized i missed ipw firmware... that can be the reason, i&#039;ll fix it.

I would swith from Mint Fluxbox if I had wireless support.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@LLR Hey, relax!  It can be frustrating, I know.  Just relax and try the most obvious, easy choices.

I _did_ have a lot of fun reading your comment - then downloading openSuSE LXDE and trying the obvious logins/passwords.....
Took about 40 seconds to login as &#039;linux&#039; - there is NO password,
ditto &#039;root&#039; - no password.  

OK, I&#039;m a smartass!

@openSuSE
Thanks for the LXDE distro guys - it looks good, works well live on our ancient Compaq laptop (Celeron 1.6) and the RAM usage is 
pretty good - 150MB after boot (ignoring buffers and cache). Handy when we only have 768MB shared with the gruesome graphics.

Wish I could get the hang of using YAST properly.   
Clearly sophisticated and powerful, but we always end up arguing with one another.

Best regards, Ben]]></description>
