		<description><![CDATA[Hi there. The STA driver doesn&#039;t support monitor mode. For me thats a big fail because I&#039;m attached to what the driver let me or not do with my card. 

Moreover, that driver, at least for me, its buggy, and with this procedure i got a bigger wireless range and more stable connection, and of course, again monitor mode and package injection without problems.

The STA (WL) driver works, but you are not free to do whatever you want. ;)]]></description>
