Good luck for openSUSE popularity @ Russia. I&#039;ve checked Google Trend (http://google.com/trends?q=opensuse) and found that Russia is one of top country where openSUSE are a popular distro (based on search popularity).

According to download counting on d.o.o, Indonesia will not be counting on the statistics because almost all of us download the iso or updating the package by using local mirror in Indonesia, although d.o.o has a redirect feature to the nearest mirror.]]></description>
