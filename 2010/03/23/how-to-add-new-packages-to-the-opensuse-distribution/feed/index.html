		<description><![CDATA[The grub2.spec file if the file that contains the information about how the package is built. See http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/ch-rpm-inside.html for more information about spec files. The build tutorial (http://en.opensuse.org/SUSE_build_tutorial) is also very helpful.

The grub2.changes file is just a file to keep track of changes. Rather than changing the spec file for every update or change we keep track of these changes in the .changes file. You can consider this file to be a history of your more verbose check-in comments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is unclear for me what the spec file (grub2.spec) and the changes file (grub2.changes) are and how can be generated.
Once a package submitted in factory, how it could be moved to the standard distribution ? (in the stable repos)]]></description>
