		<description><![CDATA[I am working on Screenie2 which is way cooler and also fixes the above mentioned shadow issue. And like any other tools, Screenie allows you to shoot your own foot, i.e. you can create a very ugly shot with it. I recommend to use it only with the right image size and proper color balance, see e.g. http://www.flickr.com/photos/ariyahidayat/2545790007/sizes/m/.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is anybody supposed to actually recognize anything on such screenshots?
I hate them. They look kinda fancy, but serve no purpose besides that. I prefer plain, 2D screenshots on which I can really see the software.]]></description>
