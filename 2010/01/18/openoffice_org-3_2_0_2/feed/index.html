		<description><![CDATA[I am sorry. I have somehow missed your comment because I did not get the mail notification from some reasons.

When I wrote the message, the known blocker bugs were in the upstream sources and they were discussed on the releases@openoffice.org mailing list, see the mailing list &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=releases&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;archive&lt;/a&gt;.

Anyway, thanks for feedback. I will try to mention the known blocker bugs next time.]]></description>
