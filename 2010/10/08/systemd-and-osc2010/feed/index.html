		<description><![CDATA[Arjan de Van&#039;s analysis is interesting but he does set up a strawman argument that systemd inherently creates inefficient stalls.  He asserts that systemd starts all services just-in-time which can be sub-optimal.  However, systemd is perfectly capable of starting a service unconditionally at startup.  Thus, with systemd you have a greater choice of strategies to employ to ensure that system resources are maximally employed on the most critical tasks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My understanding is that systemd is less about only starting services on demand but rather solving the dependency issues by using blocking sockets.

When it comes to booting quickly though, it&#039;s less about starting everything in parallel and more about doing as little as possible. Sometimes tricks like prefetching also help as you can move stalls to more convenient locations. Arjan de Van loves talking about this stuff (e.g. http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.meego.devel/5481 ).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since systemd got dropped from Fedora 14, openSUSE 11.4 could be the very first major distro to ship it by default :) It&#039;s a really neat bit of engineering, and it sounds like Lennart and the rest of the team are really responsive to testing feedback and bug reports. I think getting it stable and performant by 11.4 will be easy with dev support.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My two cents: it is &quot;under heavy development&quot;, &quot;new&quot;, and not exactly bringing amazing functionality in terms of end-user experience. So, just wait for &quot;11.5&quot; ;-)]]></description>
