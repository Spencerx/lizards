		<description><![CDATA[OpenOffice.org packages in openSUSE always included many extra features and fixes that came from the Go-oo project. People around Go-oo joined LibreOffice, so it is logical that we switched to LibreOffice as well.

Note that LibreOffice is based on OpenOffice.org source code. It will still take changes from OpenOffice.org... It is likely that it will divert a bit more in the future but we all hope that most people will be happy with such changes.

Hmm, I do not have time to maintain two office suites. It someone would like to pack plain OpenOffice.org, we would need to find a volunteer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MzK, 

I&#039;m confused.  I read the minutes page that you posted, but I don&#039;t understand what you are referring to when you refer to &quot;political shenanigans&quot;.  I&#039;ve read lots of web pages re the establishment of LibreOffice and to me, it just seemed like a heap of core devs decided they wanted some independence. What am I missing?

Thanks,
   Tim.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No -- I have NOT been living under a rock! I am currently *INVOLVED* with OpenOffice.org. Unfortunately, the announcement of The Document Foundation was not really very clear or honest. The ENTIRE OpenOffice.org organizable was not involved in this decision or &quot;fork&quot; if you want to put it that way. This was some set (yes, perhaps large...though as a contributing member of OpenOffice.org, I was not aware of any petition or anything else that was circulated that would have condoned this) that instigated this split if you will. Therefore, I would like to be very clear about this -- OpenOffice,org continues to live.

And why opensuse would decide to replace a well-developed and matured office suite with LibreOffice is a great mystery to me! Maybe they don&#039;t want to continue to build two open source office suites. But...I have a feeling there&#039;s something else, more political, going on here.

Not living under a rock, and roe than happy to get to the bottom of political shenanigans. Take care and start digging!]]></description>
