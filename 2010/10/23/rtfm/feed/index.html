		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ll bid farewell to the bad name, keep doc.o.o and docs.o.o as aliases. But we wont disband the contents.

I had no intend to convey any negative message with the naming. I appreciated having a non-standard name, to make it more distinct e.g. in google. I learn and see that it appears to be quite loaded, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This needs to be disbanded now. I understand how decisions like these seem amusing and harmless at first, and are easy to set up. Unfortunately I do not think this was thought through at all.

I have filed the following bug that outlines my reasoning behind this:

		<description><![CDATA[In my humble opinion as a simple user of Opensuse, with no programming skills
or, anything like that, the RTFM page looks and reads fantastic! A &#039;Well done!&#039;
to those involved! Very well written!

There is one glitch though, at least as I see it - images on the pages. They&#039;re
so large that as a dial-up user the pages are almost useless unless I have all
day to wait for each page to load completely.

Simple fix to this - compress the images before they&#039;re put up on the server.
One example, I  did a &#039;save as&#039; on one of the png&#039;s on the first page of the
RTFM. 753kb! I did a simple right-click on it in konqueror file manager went to
kim compress and resize, and compressed the png at 60%. Ta-da! The pic now is
only 120kb in size and looks exactly the same (to the naked eye).

We cannot forget that there are still an awful lot of people on dial-up for who
knows how many reasons, none of which are our business to ask why. If we just
use a lame excuse like &#039;oh, but lots of people are on dsl&#039; or whatever...so
what!? It&#039;s still better for everyone if there&#039;s simply less &#039;size&#039; using up
space! Besides...any excuse for *NOT* doing something as simple as compressing a
file before using it, makes us just as bad as the Windows users back in the
days we L/UNIX users used to bash the Windows users for such bloated software
and incompetence in the same areas.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At least the Portal:Documentation should point to rtfm.o.o.
Also, let&#039;s check which other places can point to rtfm.o.o.

Otherwise: Great to have all of this together!]]></description>
