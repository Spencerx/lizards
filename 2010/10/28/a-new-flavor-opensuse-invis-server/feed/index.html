		<description><![CDATA[Since 1993 - it&#039;s about time!!! and it makes me happy. I&#039;m 55 now and it&#039;s been a long long wait for something like this to finally come about. A distro (especially SuSE) that will be a complete done deal without all the games and other crap apps getting in the way of server needs and instead of having to do a Command Line alone install to get free of it. KUDOS to you guys. I&#039;m not a programmer just a network and system administrator or I would have done it 10 years ago. Believe me when I say - &quot;We don&#039;t get any younger!!&quot; What is there that a poweruser like me to do for you. Buy you a server or something? Can&#039;t do much other.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is great news! While opensuse already is a very reliable and flexible server solution, currently offerin several serverfunctions in one machine can offer some tedious configuration challenges, mostly because of webmin and yast not always being on the same page.
I am really looking forward to seeing this initiative mature!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

at first. Until now we are a german project, therefore our site is german only. We are open to translate the site, our project, our wiki and so on to english. But it was and is a problem of time, manpower and our &quot;english&quot; skills. In a short  sentence: we need help!

Stefan

By the way. The other adresses:

... and our small new project:

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s great. I&#039;m currently preparing our &quot;IntarS&quot; webbased Open Source ERP to become a openSUSE package so we can add is as a business suite option.
IntarS is best suited for small to medium sized companies, even single user. There is a preconfigured setup available, called &quot;Candy-CRM&quot;. It provides such things as offers, orders, customer orders, production planning, invoices, work orders, delivery notes, stock management, a very elaborate CRM, communication hub, document managent and much more. Have a look: http://87.106.2.1/GSWeb/Aprica2000230.woa?pw=root&#038;loginname=Administrator]]></description>
