		<description><![CDATA[I am the perfect candidate for using your software. A small business owner who is well versed in free software and who runs his whole company on Floss software.

Yet when I last tried Kraft, which was a few months ago when Kraft was still developed with the kde3 libraries, I found it too hard to use and too limited. I need to be able to issue invoices easily, but also keep track of which are paid and which are unpaid.I need to keep track of inventory and clients. In other words, who are my suppliers, what they have sold me, who I have sold it to, etc.

But even if it was just issuing invoices, I need a system that is dead-easy to implement and use, since my administrative staff would be the ones using it. At the time, I did not understand the template system you use and the documentation was full of &quot;Germanglish&quot; that made it hard to understand. 

I am very grateful for the work you are doing. It is really needed and I am at your complete disposal for testing, answering questions or helping in any way I can.


Thanks,

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to attack the elephant in the room here.  You&#039;re concerned about user base?  You want to expand your audience?  On your downloads page I don&#039;t see a Windows or Mac port of your software.  If you really want to easily expand your user base you need to go where the most users are.  I am an avid linux user so don&#039;t get me wrong here...but in general I think the long term success of attracting new users to KDE software relies way more on porting our applications to these other platforms than most people care to admit. Once you hook these Windows/Mac users on your software then they might start to care about other FOSS projects and wonder what linux is and eventually give that a try.  But imho it all starts with application developers like you making your applications the gateway drug to show people the way into linux communities ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with pretty much all comments here.
- the website could be better (content AND layout)
- an option for commercial support would help

This is a business app so it will need a different kind of advertising. Spreading it in our own community won&#039;t make much difference. Setting it up as a commercial enterprise with a few people could certainly work best, as you&#039;d have the resources to do ads in magazines &#038; buy adwords. It might be advisable to try and get free google adwords, however... And try and get a high google ranking for the homepage.

Of course you could try to contact business magazines to get free advertising in the form of articles, but you&#039;d have to be sure the product is really easy to try (also available on windows &#038; mac, with a few-click-installer) etcetera.

I think the pond you&#039;re fishing in currently is very small... At least in the western world few small companies use linux and would consider using this. For large companies I doubt this is higly interesting, they rather keep to the big players in the field. At least for now. It might be useful for eg India and Brazil but you need some dedicated promo for that. I would offer to help out if I had a little more time...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You say &quot;A high number of users is one of the fundamental criteria for a successful free software project&quot;. I kind of disagree with that. A high number of users of course is a criteria for success, but it&#039;s not the only one, and for many projects it&#039;s even not really relevant, especially if you are targeting a specific group of users. Kraft is great, because it has a very well defined audience, that&#039;s already a very important prerequisite for success. As this audience is much smaller than the audience for general software like a media player or fundamental components of everybody&#039;s stack like the kernel, I think that the number of users is not the best criteria to judge the success here.

That said, of course it would be great to reach more users, and I think you are completely right that the only way to do this is to leave the geek corner and address the target audience on their own terms, speak their language, use the opportunities where they are present, etc.

And finally, I love the domain ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You need a better website .. sorry. It needs to be simpler, less German in the logo. You need to emphasize the key features in big letters, big download buttons for all major platforms, videos and you need real world use cases where users tell how they use Kraft. And you need SEO. Sounds harsh, but that is what you need.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since you are speaking of a software aimed at business, what would be really needed is to provide commercial support for it. I don&#039;t think companies would want to rely on volunteers (who might or might not have the time) to fix the issue they need to have fix now because otherwise they cannot issue their invoice, meaning they cannot get their money.
Since you work for Novell, maybe it is time to try to convince your management ;) (not counting that the Novell brand should be strong enough to attract the trust of customers)]]></description>
