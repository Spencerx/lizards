		<description><![CDATA[Does your lxde iso&#039;s allow the user to encrypt the whole drive for use by laptops?  This is something that fedora has working with one click on install but opensuse still seems to be struggling with.

I&#039;m  also insterested in the ISO&#039;s that fit on a cd specifically for an older laptop.  You can however install plop boot manager which will allow ANY pc to boot off usb.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m looking forward to there being a LXDE liveCD that is small enough that it can fit (and hence can burn) onto a CD.  In addition to any testing that I can do (once a newer beta version is available that will fit on a CD), I have a couple of friends who are keen on trying the openSUSE-11.3 LXDE liveCD version. ... 

Like myself they have older PCs that won&#039;t boot to a USB stick which is why we are looking forward for the liveCD.

Many thanks for your efforts !]]></description>
