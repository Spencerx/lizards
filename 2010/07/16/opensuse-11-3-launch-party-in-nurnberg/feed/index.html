		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the great party. I am one of the faces you haven&#039;t seen before and I certainly enjoyed the beer, the BBQ, and most of all meeting some of the people who bring us humble users such great software. 
I brought my netbook along for the party and installed 11.3 there and then. Good opportunity to have a chat with the experts about various aspects of it.
