		<description><![CDATA[I have been playing around with this for about two weeks. I have installed this (not once, but 3 or 4 times) on a Dell Inspiron 2500 Laptop with 320 MB of RAM.  So this should be a good test for an older machine. So far, the major struggle has been with getting the wireless Network card to work with the native drivers.

The only quirk I have noticed is that the File Manager does not always automatically unmount a device when it is ejected. At least I thought it was supposed to be unmounted automatically.  This makes the same drive (e.g., cd drive) not see the next disk that is inserted. I don&#039;t think this is an opensuse issue but rather a quirk of the File Manager in LXDE.

However, it has been very stable.  The main use of this laptop is for web access and to provide a network connection to another computer in a part of my house not wired for network access (through a shared internet connection).

So for the first time, I have been able to install openSUSE on this machine. This is great!  Thanks for all your hard work.]]></description>
