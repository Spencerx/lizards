		<description><![CDATA[I never heard of the Verein Computerspende Hamburg before, thank you for making me aware of it. I think it&#039;s a great project and an impressive effort. Even more so since the guy running it is apparently forced to live of Hartz IV as well.

Thanks for making more people aware of it by posting about it, and thanks for providing them for providing them with the DVDs!]]></description>
