		<description><![CDATA[Does this IBERIA project also mean that Kubuntu&#039;s global menu bar patches will be included?
It&#039;s the only piece I miss in my Plasma Desktop from Kubuntu but since *buntu&#039;s base OS is too bleeding edge for my taste, I like openSUSE]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a complicated question... I would love to have it available for all the openSUSE users... that&#039;s the main idea. I will push some indicators to GNOME:Apps alongside with the dependencies for their correct projects, but not all.

I will also keep some patched alternative software on my repository to go with it (ex: nm-applet, empathy, etc).

And if someone wants to start/help on creating a repository for the Ubuntu&#039;s Ayatana project, I can donate everything I&#039;ve done already.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome job! Ubuntu has some very nice tweaks added to the stock GNOME desktop. I noticed that the border around the Ambiance there is not &quot;circular&quot; and is &quot;rectangular&quot;. I was frustrated by this as well, but managed to patch Metacity through an Ubuntu patch called 13_better_support_for_button_layout.patch. I have the patchedMetacity at :- http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/anshuljain/openSUSE_11.3/src/metacity-2.30.1-4.1.src.rpm. This will take care of the rounding issue. If you use Compiz then it breaks again. You need to re-compile Compiz against the Metacity with the patch I mentioned (against the metacity-devel).

I do hope you maintain your packages for 11.3 as well :)]]></description>
