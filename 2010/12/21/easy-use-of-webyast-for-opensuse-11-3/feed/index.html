		<description><![CDATA[Hi, thanks for this writeup! I&#039;ve always liked the idea of a web-based config tool. How does the functionality of WebYaST compare to the regular X11 YaST? What modules are present?

Thanks a lot!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[- syslog-ng will be installed cause WebYaST is mainly based on SLES. But you are right, we
  can also use rsyslog while building the packages for OpenSuSE. Could you please make a
  bug report ? Thanks !
- samba-winbind will be used by the ActiveDirectory module. Is this an error ?
- The applet RPM is qwebyast which is stored in http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/Web/openSUSE_11.3/ It should be installed automatically by the one click installation.

Thanks for feedback !!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why does the install of WebYaST install programs such as syslog-ng and samba-winbind as a dependency? openSUSE 11.3 uses rsyslog, and who needs samba-winbind? 
The KDE menu does not offer any webyast app to me, only webyast.ymp from the recently used documents. Do I have to install the applet manually? From where?]]></description>
