		<description><![CDATA[Lucky you, so you are not using OpenSUSE 11.3
I have:
- Wacom Intuos2
- Wacom Intuos4
- Wacom Bamboo Fun
None of which works in OpenSUSE 11.3. Not after fresh install from the DVD (it ships with a 2 years old Wacom driver, god knows why).
And it doesn&#039;t work after the on-line update, 3 months after the official suse release.
With some tablets, it won&#039;t even boot properly if the tables is plugged in, as input devices (mouse, keyboard, tablet) get totally fsked.
Some tablets behave erratically, won&#039;t transmit pen clicks.

And now that Sax is gone, there is no graphical way to configure it.
So either you do it the hard way (described above by Robert, thank you) or no way.

OpenSuse packs tons of useless widgets but fails at the basics: configure graphics card, get input devices to work (Wacom), getting printer to work. You can&#039;t even manage a print queue from KDE.
All these things worked relatively well up to 10.3, but with KDE 4.x, it is just downhill, getting worse with each release.

What is the point of having Linux distribution, if you have to compile the drivers and edit udev rules by yourself?
For drivers which are GPL, available for years before the distribution was made?]]></description>
