		<description><![CDATA[Well, for some people Kraft could be obscure - not for me ,of course ;-) but maybe for those not running a business or needing those kinds of tasks. But, looking down the list in the article: Okular! Really? *The* PDF (and more) viewing application produced by one of the big two desktop software communities in the free software world is obscure?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the problem with TOra might be that it requires an Oracle client on installation. That may be the reason why Petr provides it on http://download.yarpen.cz/ and not within the build service. I once liked the tool - but due to several problems with TOra some years ago when I switched to x86_64 I don&#039;t use it any more, I use Oracle&#039;s free SQLdeveloper instead. I still think that the idea of TOra is more convincing that that of SQLdeveloper, though ;-)
