		<description><![CDATA[On what hardware and with which version of the count_bee patch did you achive the processing of 25,000 bee colonies? When I was testing count_bee version 0.8-4 I was only able to process approx. 11,000 colonies (since I only have 200 colonies, I used their beehavior to do some upscale simulation) on rather standard PC hardware. Did you do any additional tuning?

I also noted an instability in the sting proof patch in the presence of hornets. According to kernel developer A. Piarist a patch is currently under development and will be ready for testing after easter.]]></description>
