		<description><![CDATA[Guys, I think the Gnome version is great as is --! I just fired up the Ubuntu 10.10 beta and think it pales in comparison to the mature, clean look of OpenSUSE 11.3 Gnome. At any rate, from my perspective probably making it easier to customize the slab would be a good idea. Other than that, I think as long as you lads stick to the upstream version of Gnome and add a bit of the ol&#039; OpenSUSE style to it things will be great. Thanks for your hard work!]]></description>

In the meanwhile why not try out an openSUSE 11.3 GNOME LiveCD and let us know what improvements, etc. we can make?]]></description>

Could you confirm the release date of OpenSuse gnome edition? It might well entice me back to gnome if it&#039;s more polished as the article suggests.]]></description>
