		<description><![CDATA[I think it would also be good if the person who made an idea could change its status, at least to &quot;Done&quot;.  I have a couple ideas that are still &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; even though they have been implemented and I posted comments saying they were implemented months ago.  If I am satisfied my own idea has been implemented, I think I should be able to change the status of the idea to reflect that.  After all, I am the one who would know best whether any changes that might have happened reflect my intention for the idea.]]></description>
