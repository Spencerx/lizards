		<description><![CDATA[My personal preference, while I have always used Emacs/Auctex in the past, is TeXworks.  The preview functionality is really handy and a time saver, especially when previewing documents to co-workers.  Another plus is, I am a GNOME user so outside of Emacs, I prefer editors I can plop into my openSUSE systems which don&#039;t include a stitch of KDE; I&#039;m a past satisfied user of Kile but have since moved on.  The downside is, while TeXworks is a very nice tool and widely distributed, it is still young and work really needs to get done to move to a stable major release.  That said, it is one of the reasons I use the tool so useful feedback to the project can get it moving in that direction.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Will, for pointing out my allergies. Guess I need to see a doctor about that, huh? Seriously though, I was just pointing out that there are apps that do work without pulling in a million kde libraries, and perhaps do a better job. Subjective matter here, but I do like texmaker a hell of a lot better than kile, though I do appreciate that the latter is a good application nonetheless. Oh! And you would do well to understand the network status of the place I am from, or the places I am trying to push linux desktops to -- network status is not great and also quite expensive. I can do without downloading so many kde libraries if I am using GNOME, right? Of course texlive, etc. I HAVE to pull-in as I NEED them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Atri

Your allergy to KDE libraries is so 2001.  Every reasonably complex app pulls in some platform with it.  Firefox/Thunderbird pulls in xulrunner, OpenOffice has its UNO toolkit, Chrom[e&#124;ium] has its own stack.  Unless you are also not installing these and using only Epiphany, Abiword and Evolution, agitating against useful apps based on the KDE platform is irrational prejudice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kile also supports source/preview synchronization.  It has always integrated just fine with my GNOME desktop.  It&#039;s true that it pulls in a lot of KDE dependencies, but I also tend to run a mix of KDE and GNOME programs, so that&#039;s never been an issue for me.]]></description>
