		<description><![CDATA[I am sorry for the late reply. I do not understand why lizards.opensuse.org does not longer send me mails when a new comment appears :-(

The different behavior with autocomplete is &lt;a href=&quot;http://cgit.freedesktop.org/ooo-build/ooo-build/commit/?id=dfa82b824aa2bcdbe615422df1c9fffb6cea94f8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt;. It tries to fix the upstream issue &lt;a href=&quot;http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=18748&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;#18748&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to report bug into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.novell.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Novell bugzilla&lt;/a&gt; against the product OpenOffice.org if you do not like the new behavior. We might make it configurable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Working great! (1). Only one curious glitch: in Calc I used to change between &quot;cell autofill&quot; options with tab (this still works on Sun&#039;s 3.2 build) but now on Novell build tab moves to the right cell. For example, if I have
pepe
pete
on cells A1 and A2, and if I start typing &quot;pe&quot; in A3 &quot;pepe&quot; is suggested. On previous versions I could use tab to change the suggestion to &quot;pete&quot; but now tab moves the cursor to the right cell. I cannot find how to come back to the previous situation... Is there a way? As I said before, this is not an upstream change.

(1) after uninstall the kde4 integration package and delete the /usr/lib64/ooo3/basis-link/program/libvclplug_kde4lx.so file as I did with 3.1.1, because there are still problems with the kde4 integration (yes, all of them reported ;)).]]></description>
