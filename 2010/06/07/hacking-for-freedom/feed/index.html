		<description><![CDATA[I hope we&#039;ll be finally able to use knetworkmanager to actually connect to WiFi. Connection added in connection editor differs with connection available to chose inside the applet by name, security etc. So settings may be saved in different placed, what actually sucks.

Also, I&#039;ve been experiencing NM&#039;s stupid behaviour: I had to wait after computer startup about a minute or select connection by hand to get connected. Just wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This issue mentioned in this blog was something that I also was experiencing. I even reported it as a KDE bug for sebas, but after checking a couple of other bug reports, it appeared that this strange behavior is caused by an outdated libdbusmenu-qt. It seems that all plasmoids in the systray are using this new program and the latest KDE SC 4.5 snapshots require the latest version (0.3.3). If you are using the packages from KDE:KDE4:Unstable then you should be able to upgrade. This solved the bug for me. 

The source repo you mentioned is correct and the only one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m just fine with you working on network management stuff - esp if you can get things like bluetooth/usb tethering to work :D

Otherwise, it mostly needs stability, good looks, ease of use and &#039;just works&#039; (as automatic as possible - eg if I want to connect to a network, it&#039;s OK to ask for a password, NOT let me choose between WPA/WEP and all that stuff).]]></description>
