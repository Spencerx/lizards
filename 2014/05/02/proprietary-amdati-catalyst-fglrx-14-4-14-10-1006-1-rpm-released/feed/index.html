		<description><![CDATA[Translation of the post by Sebastian Siebert dated 1st May 2014 with updates dated 27th May 2014:

AMD Catalyst 14.4 driver (fglrx 14.10.1006)
The makerpm-amd script:

The script ‚Äúmakerpm-amd-14.4.sh‚Äù is quite powerful, robust and runs completely automatically. The AMD installer is automatically downloaded if it cannot be found in the current directory. A check is made to ensure that the detected graphic card is supported. If required, after the RPM package has been built the package contents are installed.

The script accepts the following options:
-b
Only build the RPM package (default behaviour)
-c 
Only configure the X-Server.
Monitor type: ‚Äúsingle‚Äù = 1 monitor; ‚Äúdual‚Äù = 2 monitors.
(N.B.: run only if problems with the default X-Server configuration occur.)
-d
Only download the AMD installer.
-i
Build the RPM package and then install or update the package contents.
-kms 
Activate or deactivate the kernel mode-setting (KMS).
-nohw
Explicitly deactivate hardware detection. (For example when building the RPM package in a VM.)
-old2ddriver 
Activate or deactivate the old 2-D driver.
-r &#124; ‚Äìreport
Generate a report and store it in the file named ‚Äúamd-report.txt‚Äù.
-u &#124; ‚Äìuninstall
Completely remove the AMD Catalyst from the system.
First, if it has been installed, the ‚Äúfglrx‚Äù package is de-installed. Then, any AMD files and directories present are removed.
Note: if the rebuild script was installed, then it is also removed and the initialisation script ‚Äú/etc/init.d/xdm‚Äù is reinstalled.
-ur &#124; ‚Äìuploadreport
Same as the option ‚Äú-report‚Äù except that the generated report is uploaded to the NoPaste service ‚Äúsprunge.us‚Äù and the resulting URL is returned.
-h
Display this help text and then exit.
-V
Display the current version of this script and then exit.

Help! It doesn&#039;t work!
Please adhere to the following rules:

1. Check that the call to the script has been correctly typed.
2. It is possible that the solution has been documented in the openSUSE AMD graphic driver SDB.
3. Read the comments (mostly in German) to Sebastian&#039;s website.
[Translated comments may appear soon.]

When the above rules have been adhered to, then you may forward your concerns to me (Sebastian Siebert).
In order that I can help you, please prepare the issue you wish to report as follows: with the script ‚Äúmakerpm-amd-14.4.sh‚Äù create and upload a report:
&#062; su -c &#039;sh makerpm-amd-14.4.sh -ur&#039;
The script will return a URL to the report&#039;s location on &#039;sprunge.us&#039;. Create a comment on my website and include the generated &#039;sprunge.us&#039; URL with the description of the issue you have uncovered. I will inspect your report and give assistance as to how the issue can be possibly resolved.

Feedbacks are always welcome! :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Post from Sebastian Siebert dated 1st May 2014 with updates dated 27th May 2014:

AMD Catalyst 14.4 driver (fglrx 14.10.1006) has been published and supports Radeon HD 5000 and higher graphic cards. The script makerpm-amd-14.4.sh is available for download  as of now and supports openSUSE 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 13.1 as well as kernels up to and including 3.13. The packaging script includes a patch which supports kernels up to and including 3.14.

Update: (27th May 2014)
The script has been updated to support the 2nd version of the AMD Catalyst 14.4 driver (fglrx 14.10.1006.1001). Unfortunately AMD hadn&#039;t updated the Release Notes to include the latest driver changes.

Excerpts from the latest AMD Catalyst 14.4 Release Notes are as follows:

New Features:
    Support for the AMD Radeon R9 295X
    Ubuntu 12.04.4 support
    Full support for OpenGL 4.4
    OpenGL 4.4 supports the following extensions:
        ARB_buffer_storage
        ARB_enhanced_layouts
        ARB_query_buffer_object
        ARB_clear_texture
        ARB_texture_mirror_clamp_to_edge
        ARB_texture_stencil8
        ARB_vertex_type_10f_11f_11f_rev
        ARB_multi_bind
        ARB_bindless_texture
        ARB_spare_texture
        ARB_seamless_cubemap_per_texture
        ARB_indirect_parameters
        ARB_shader_group_vote

The following issues have been resolved by the new driver:

    Corruption and system hang observed while running Sanctuary BM with Tear Free Desktop enabled
    Memory leak about hardware context
    EGL create context error for glesx
    GPU hand in CrossFire Mode
    [Piglit] Test ‚Äúspec/arb_vertex_array_object‚Äù failed
    [Piglit] Test ‚Äúglx/GLX_EXT_import_context/free context‚Äù failed
    [Piglit] Test ‚Äúspec/ARB_seamless_cube_map‚Äù failed
    Piglit] Test ‚Äútexture swizzle with border color‚Äù failed
    Glxtest failures observed in log file
    Blank screen observed while running steam games with Big picture
    4ms delay observed in the glxSwapBuffers when vsync is enabled
    RBDoom3BFG the game auto quit when use the security camera terminal
    ETQW segmentation fault

The following unresolved issues have not been addressed by the new driver:
    Performance on some Steam OS games is lower on 1GB graphics memory cards, compared with 2GB graphics memory cards
    Some Piglit tests cause a system hang under Ubuntu

‚Äì------------------------------------------------------------------
I have tested the following Steam games and found that they run as expected with the new driver:
    Amnesia: The Dark Descent
    Cities in Motion 2
    Creeper World III: Arc Eternal
    Crusader Kings II
    Darwinia
    Defcon
    Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition
    Euro Trucker Simulator
    Europa Universalis IV
    Game Dev Tycoon
    Half-Life 2: Deathmatch
    Half-Life 2: Lost Coast
    Hotel Miami
    Kerbal Space Program
    Prison Architect
    Project Zomboid
    Shadow Warrior Classic Redux
    Strike Suit Zero
    Survivor Squad
    Wargame: AirLand Battle
    Wargame: European Escalation

‚Äì------------------------------------------------------------------
I have a little request: if you discover any problems or issues with the new driver, please do not hesitate to report the noticed behaviour (I happily accept reports in English or German ;-)). I will attempt, so far as possible, to reproduce each reported problem. Together with the necessary System Information I will then forward the reported problem on to the responsible AMD staff for correction with the driver release. Thank you! :-)

Users of older AMD graphic cards (Radeon HD Series 2000 ‚Äì 4000) are strongly advised to avoid the installation of this current ‚Äúfglrx‚Äù driver. The open source Radeon driver which supports older graphic cards is included with the openSUSE distribution. The regular improvements made to the open source Radeon driver require the installation of the related (new) kernel version.]]></description>
