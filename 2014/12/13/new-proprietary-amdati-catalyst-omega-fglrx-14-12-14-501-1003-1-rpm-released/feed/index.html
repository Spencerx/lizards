		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your work : the driver was perfect under Tumbleweed with 3.18 kernel. But I have updated to 3.19 and fglrx is broken...
I posted here :
https://forums.opensuse.org/showthread.php/505434-X-doesn-t-start-after-kernel-update-with-AMD-Catalyst-%28fglrx%29
I think we need a new version for 3.19 kernel. Thanks in advance for your help and if you need some help for test, I&#039;m here !

		<description><![CDATA[This package of AMD fglrx installed easily and works well EXCEPT...

If you are a Second Life or OpenSimulator user who wears clothing made from rigged mesh, you will not see the mesh objects. They will be invisible. You can see them if you turn &quot;Hardware Skinning&quot; off within the viewers (happens with all of them) which is not a suggested idea. Running without hardware skinning can lead to overheating as the CPU has to do more work to make up for the turned off GPU.

It is best to rollback to the earlier fglrx package, 14.201.1006.1002. Rigged mesh can be seen with hardware skinning active.

This is a known problem for all AMD drivers beginning with 14.9 that affected a few machines. It appears that 14.12 affects a wider number of machines on all OS platforms. 

The Mesa/Gallium driver combo may work for some AMD GPUs, but not for any that are driven by the R600 opensource driver. That, too, uses a software renderer only and leads to degraded performance and increased heat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Prior to SuSe 13.1, in order to get usably smooth graphics with dual heads enabled, fglrx used to be my go to graphics driver on SuSe &#060; 13.1 as the free suplied ATI driver was very choppy. Back about a year or more ago, every time m Xorg would update in yast, I would need to manually re-install it. This was very very easy. Just now I saw an xorg update, so I called my script, 
that I wrote, &#034;is_catalyst_installed&#034; which checks to see if fglrx is the currently running driver. It returned my &#034;YOU MUST REINSTALL CATALYST&#034; message. Now I admit, the cobwebs are starting to stick at the age of (nearly) 53, and I did not remember if, since upgrading to 13.1-- have I just gone with the new freeware, or was I still using catalyst. I decided, based upon my earlier knowledge of the level of quality, why not take the plunge. I followed instructions up at https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx#1-click_install_64_bits, took the &#034;add repository and then install in Yast2&#034; method, and then restarted the system. What a disaster. At least some failsafe graphics driver was working, but the screen res was wrong, (1 inch of black all the way arond) and no dual head option. I ended up (1) uninstalling the fglrx NOISE, (2) REMOVING the fglrx repository and (3) reverting (crossing my fingers at each step of the way. I&#039;m back to smooth, beautiful smooth with dual heads at the correct screen resolution (no black around the edges). 

Bottom line -- if you&#039;re on SuSe 13.1 stay the hell away from fglrx. Maybe there out to be a YMMV warning somewhere. Well, consider this to be one.]]></description>
