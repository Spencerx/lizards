		<description><![CDATA[All very cool stuff...

Before getting into the article itself,
I&#039;d like to mention that yesterday I saw a very enterprising YouTube video that described how he set up an XFCE Desktop to run on Ubuntu... Which I thought was extraordinarily ambitious. IMO there would be extreme interest if anyone were to put in an effort to do same on openSUSE. IIRC involved installing an X Server I&#039;d never heard of before, then some further tinkering with X display configuration.

Here is some immediate feedback and observation on this YaST Developmebt Sprint 94 article (Thx!)...

Improved Compatibility with WSL
I don&#039;t remember how long it took to install 15.1 WSL on my old system, it did take awhile but haven&#039;t checked on this recently. I did observe a CentOS installed on someone else&#039; system that took only about a minute. Noticed with pleasure the Microsoft store cleanup, removing the multiple old apps that pretty much all did the same thing.

I took this opportunity to install WSL on a new system (Intel 8050 1.8mhz, 16GB Optane/1TB 7200 HDD), and it installed in 40 seconds. Inspecting YAST modules, I do suspect implements described improvements removing unnecessary modules but I suspect may have been overdone. I will personally review over next few days. Never know for sure if Optane has an effect, it has a 2x effect installing VBox packages but not always apparent when something is running first time.

Noticed that WSL only has OSS and OSS update repos installed. Notable.

I can&#039;t remember my first experience booting 42.3 the first time, so can&#039;t comment on firstboot performance, but is plenty fast after repos have been refreshed the first time.

Interesting about removing systemd completely (running in Windows init).
I seem to remember limited systemd commands working before, particularly checking status but problematic whether can start/stop. Now, nothing. 

In fact,
No services reported running even using the &quot;service --status-all&quot; command
And, Partitioner is reading not just no devices but nothing at all (The module just runs with no content). I see at the bottom this is recognized and reason unknown.
Interesting that &quot;journalctl&quot; is still in the system although it doesn&#039;t work because there is nothing to read.

There is an urgent problem with system messages...
Of course the journal and anything systemd related doesn&#039;t exist.
But, there are no system logs in /var/log either (just some yast and other logs).
You allowed the yast2-module to read system logs to remain, but when it&#039;s run, it&#039;s apparently only a pointer that installs the actual module and that in turn discovers there&#039;s nothing to read again.

Bottom line, although I didn&#039;t check out the full extent of what was possible using systemd in WSL before, I don&#039;t remember running into so many issues, the ramifications of ripping out systemd is likely more extensive than realized.

That&#039;s really cool about YaST identifying sysctl conflicts, AFAIK in general sysctl is the preferred way for low level custom modifications so that if there is a conflict(compare what would happen if the change is made directly to /etc/proc/), the modification will fail without borking the system but doesn&#039;t identify what the conflict might be (might be in the system logs)

Much thx to all the hard work that went into these changes...]]></description>
