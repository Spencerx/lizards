				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.muktware.com/2013/12/nvidia-drivers-now-available-opensuse-13-1/17381"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Nvidia-300x168.jpg" alt="Nvidia pic from Muktware" width="300" height="168" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10405" /></a><br />
The NVIDIA drivers for openSUSE 13.1 took a while to appear. Many users have asked why this was and we&#8217;d like to explain what happened and what we plan to do to prevent this in the future. This post was written with input from the openSUSE developers who maintain these drivers at SUSE and work with NVIDIA to make them available for our users.</p>
<h2>How it should work</h2>
<p>Legally, the Linux kernel GPLv2 license leaves proprietary binary drivers in a bit of a tangle. While some claim it should be OK, others say not &#8211; and that is what most distributions currently assume: one can not ship a Linux distribution with proprietary, binary drivers. NVIDIA has agreed that our users can grab their drivers from the official NVIDIA servers. They are packaged by SUSE engineers however. They take care of both SLE and openSUSE proprietary driver packaging for NVIDIA hardware, and have contacts at NVIDIA who get the drivers up on their ftp mirrors.<br />
<a href="http://opensuse-community.org/nvidia.ymp"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Nvidia-1click.png" alt="Nvidia-1click" width="160" height="40" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10406" /></a><br />
The packages are build on a dedicated system, but the package spec (skeleton for building) is in OBS &#8211; for example, <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/X11:Drivers:Video/nvidia-gfxG03">G03 is here</a>. Anybody could use these to build the nvidia driver locally (the nvidia binary driver is grabbed from the nvidia driver during building). The command sequence for local building can be found in <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/X11:Drivers:Video/nvidia-gfxG03/README?expand=1">the README</a>.</p>
<p>Once the packages are build, they are send to NVIDIA, which signs the packages with their key and generates and signs repositories, making them available to the public.</p>
<p>To note is the fact that this is all manual and takes a while on NVIDIA&#8217;s side (and ours). This of course is part of the reason why we don&#8217;t offer NVIDIA packages for Factory, our fast-rolling development repository.</p>
<h2>What happened</h2>
<p>What occurred for 13.1 is a typical case of &#8220;everything went wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>Up until a few weeks before the release, the driver did not build against the Linux Kernel version 3.11. NVIDIA warned against the use of a patch for this problem created by third parties so the driver team did not have a running build. Due to a holiday, it took a while to get the packages build and pushed to NVIDIA. Unfortunately, by the time this was done, the holiday period at NVIDIA blocked progress for another week. Once the package was signed, it took the webteam at NVIDIA another week to get the repository published. It all added up to almost a month and brought quite some inconvenience for users eager to use their latest NVIDIA cards with the latest openSUSE.</p>
<p>About a week later, the openSUSE 13.1 NVIDIA drivers disappeared again from the nvidia servers for a day or so. We don&#8217;t know exactly what happened there, it might have simply been a server issue.</p>
<h2>What we will do</h2>
<p>The first and  most obvious thing to change would be to improve coordination. The developers taking care of the NVIDIA packages should be made aware as early as possible about the release planning and a replacement in case for holidays should be available. We noted this in our 13.1 release report and will make sure that there will be a <a href="http://progress.opensuse.org">task in our task tracker</a> for this for the next release. We also need to talk to NVIDIA about this to make sure that there, too, somebody can fill in for SUSE&#8217;s contacts.</p>
<p>But there are also thoughts on how to improve further. Some of the current ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>To get drivers for Factory the process needs more automation as the driver may break on kernel or X changes</li>
<li>We could try to open the process and work with community members to secure the process in case the SUSE folks are unavailalbe</li>
<li>It would be nice if we could make NVidia to see benefit of working more on the driver in openSUSE, e.g. by doing some testing</li>
<li>We could write some scripts that check regularly whether repo and packages are still available and in a valid state (meta data matches available RPMs)</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to see which of these we can implement, when and how. But rest assured that we will do what we can to prevent this in the future!</p>

<h2>And the stats!</h2>
<p>After a bit of a hiatus, we&#8217;re back with the numbers. Development has slowed down around new year and isn&#8217;t back to speed yet so the 10th spot is shared by quite a big group of people&#8230;</p>

<p>Patience is a virtue, months of it and finally we got a proof that Santa Claus exist <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
This release allow me to wish you a Merry Christmas!
</p>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above.<br />
For older gpu, the fglrx-legacy is still 13.1, and thus didn&#8217;t work with openSUSE 12.3 or above.<br />
<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx_legacy">SDB:AMD_fgrlx_legacy</a><br />
Beware of that, and prefer the free open-source radeon driver which came out of the box from your openSUSE distribution.<br />
For 12.3 and especially 13.1 the free radeon often offer a better experience than the old fglrx-legacy.
</p>
<h4>Changing the signer of package</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve done a change with which key used for signing the package and repository. So you will need to trust the new key for the repository</p>
<pre>
zypper ref -f -r amd-fglrx
Forcing raw metadata refresh
Retrieving repository 'amd-fglrx' metadata ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[\]

<h4>Help for spreading the word</h4>
<p>Dear fellow I&#8217;m counting on you to spread the word, in the different social media you&#8217;re subscribed, and also on Mailing list, forums.<br />
Feel free also to translate it into your native language
</p>
<h3>Release note about 13.12</h3>
<p>
This Catalyst fglrx version support openSUSE version from 11.4 to 13.1 and also Tumbleweed (thus also kernel 3.12/13 series).<br />
A special thanks to Sebastian Siebert for his effort on making this driver working under openSUSE.
</p>
<p>If a kind German geeko can take the time to translate his article, put the result in comments below, you will understand that getting it working,<br />
is not just Fun.</p>
<h4>Notice for users of the -beta repository</h4>
<p>If you previously used the fglrx drivers using the -beta created for fglrx 13.11, you could not switch back the url of the repository to the standard one.<br />
The beta will contain now outdated driver until AMD release a new one.<br />
If you were using the normal repository the update should appear directly
</p>
<pre>To change the url if your repository is called FGLRX
zypper mr -n FLGRX http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx/openSUSE_13.1
</pre>
<h3>Tumbleweed</h3>
<p>For tumbleweed due to the change of openSUSE version from 12.3 to 13.1, you will certainly have remove the old package and install the new one.</p>
<pre>
zypper rm fglrx64_xpic_SUSE123

zypper in fglrx64_xpic_SUSE131
[snipped par of installation]
Calling 'depmod -a 3.12.5-3.g48b587a-desktop' this may take a while...

<p>If you have any problems with the driver, don&#8217;t be afraid to report to Sebastian (German and English bug report are gladly accepted).<br />
he will try, as far as I am able to reproduce the bug. Together with the necessary system information, he will go directly to the right place at AMD to have the bug fixed in the next driver release.<br />
Thank you very much, Sebastian.
</p>
<p>See below what to do in case of troubles.</p>
<p>Or you can also ping him on irc (freespacer)</p>
<h4>Debugging troubles</h4>
<p>I recommend in case of trouble the use of <a href="http://www.sebastian-siebert.de/downloads/makerpm-amd-13.12.sh">his script</a> which can collect the whole information needed to help you. then you just have to issue a simple command in console to collect all information, you can review them, and finally transmit them.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b> Important </b><br />
If you&#8217;re still using openSUSE 12.1 and you have one day installed the AMD/ATI FGLRX long time ago, you certainly forget to adjust the new location of the repository.</p>
<p>My server indicate that still around 154 Geekos have their FGLRX repository pointing to the old urls : </p>
<p>http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/ati/openSUSE_12.1/</p>
<p>The location changed long time ago, when AMD decide to split the drivers in two part (legacy HD2xxx-HD4xxx and normal HD5xxx or above).<br />
The worst things, is that those are trying to refresh almost every half hour, generating 404 errors on my server, without help them to get the right driver.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a call at that time to help to spread the information. Would be nice, if any of you could spread this reminder to your fellows.<br />
Cause I can decide by a redirection, which gpu you have <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>The new location for 12.1 was setup as following :<br />
For HD2xxx-HD4xxxx legacy :<a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-legacy/openSUSE_12.1">http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-legacy/openSUSE_12.1/</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Yippee Yeah Another Proprietary AMD/ATI Catalyst fglrx 13.11 BETA v9.4 (13.25.18-2) rpm are released for any openSUSE version</h2>
<p><img src="http://support.amd.com/Style%20Library/Images/logo.png" alt="amd logo" style="float:right" /></p>
<p>Welcome in paradise II &#8230; <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
<br />A fresh new version of the FGLRX driver has been released by AMD, and thus packaged and available for all of you.<br />
<br />Next month, AMD promise to release a stable version.
</p>
<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above. All owner of HD2xx and HD4xx are really encouraged to use the free radeon driver (which received a lot of improvement in 3.11)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s 13 and thirteen <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  When I speak about 13.1 it&#8217;s openSUSE version, 13.11 is FGLRX version, don&#8217;t get confused! Oh and 3.11 is the kernel version <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>This is experimental &amp; BETA software, it could fix issues you encountered (FGLRX not working for openSUSE 13.1),<br />
But good reports have been collected around (people having used Sebastian&#8217;s script directly)
</p>
<p>I would like to thanks again Sebastian Siebert for his effort to kept FGLRX in a good shape for all of us.</p>
<h2>Beta Repository</h2>
<p>To make things clear about the status of the drivers, it will not be published under the normal stable repository http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx.<br />
I&#8217;ve created some times ago a beta repository located at <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta">http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta</a>.<br />
The FGLRX 13.11 beta6 and beta 9.4 rpm are released for any openSUSE version from 11.4(Evergreen) to latest 13.1 + Tumbleweed<br />
<br />
Also the signer of package have change and use now the generic builder gpg key at Ioda-Net. (gpg key id 65BE584C)
</p>
<h3>Installing the new repository</h3>
<p>Admitting you&#8217;ve the normal repository named FGLRX, (use zypper lr -d to find the number or name you give it). You have to start by disabling it<br />
so you could fallback to it quickly when new stable version will be published. Open a root console or add sudo at your convenience and issue the following command:</p>
<pre>zypper mr -dR FGLRX</pre>
<p><a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fgrlx-beta/">amd-fglrx-beta</a></p>
<p>To add another repository in the same console as root issue the following command which will install normally the right repository for your distribution</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_`lsb-release -r | awk '{print $2}'` FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p><b>If you are using Tumbleweed</b> use this one</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_Tumbleweed FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Now the update/upgrade process</p>
<pre>zypper dup -r FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Let the system upgrade the package, and try to enjoy the new beta.</p>
<p><span id="more-10174"></span></p>
<h3>Upgrading from the previous beta</h3>
<p>Let the magic of zypper do the work for you</p>
<pre>zypper lu</pre>
<p> will show you the new build -2</p>
<pre>zypper up</pre>
<p> will update to the new version</p>

<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above. And adventurous users who know how to deal with troubles.<br />
The majority could easily wait the final release, expected somewhat later even if it take a long time <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
</p>
<p>This is experimental &amp; BETA software, it could fix issues you encountered, but also can eat your kittens. You&#8217;ve been warned !<br />
flgrx build for 3.11 series kernel ( Tumbleweed &amp; 13.1 ).<br />
But this time I&#8217;ve to update the Sebastian script myself, so I consider also the package as beta stage.
</p>
<h3>Installing the new repository</h3>
<p>Admitting you&#8217;ve the normal repository named FGLRX, (use zypper lr -d to find the number or name you give it). You have to start by disabling it<br />
so you could fallback to it quickly. Open a root console or add sudo at your convenience and issue the following command:</p>
<pre>zypper mr -dR FGLRX</pre>
<p>The beta driver is available for 11.4 (evergreen kernel), 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 13.1, Tumbleweed (12.3 based + kernel 3.11) at <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fgrlx-beta/">amd-fglrx-beta</a></p>
<p>To add another repository in the same console as root issue the following command which will install normally the right repository for your distribution</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_`lsb-release -r | awk '{print $2}'` FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p><b>If you are using Tumbleweed</b> use this one</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_Tumbleweed FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Now the update/upgrade process</p>
<pre>zypper dup -r FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Let the system upgrade the package, and try to enjoy the new beta</p>
<p><span id="more-9973"></span></p>
<h2>Release note about 13.10 BETA2 and new repository</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nexus 7 (2012 version) is a 7 inch tablet by Google+Asus.<br />
The nice thing about it is, that it has an unlockable bootloader. Also it has an armv7 CPU and we built openSUSE for this CPU for some years. I had one such device with a broken display, so doing some more risky things with it seemed to be appropriate.<br />
I wanted to run my own software on it. Running openSUSE in a chroot (change-root) environment is usually a lot easier than replacing the whole system, so this is where I went.</p>
<p>First, I needed two tools. One is the &#8220;adb&#8221; &#8211; Android DeBug tool from the official sdk and the other is &#8220;fastboot&#8221; which was hard to find, so I <a href="http://www.zq1.de/bernhard/mirror/android/fastboot.zip">mirror it here</a>.<br />
I got me the stable ROM from <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Grouper_Info">http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Grouper_Info</a> and followed their installation instructions. adb shell only seemed to work while in bootloader (which you reach by holding Volume-Down+Power during boot)<br />
The hardest part was to <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html#setting-up">re-enable USB-debugging</a> by going into Settings/About tablet and tapping Build-Number seven times.</p>
<p>Also before zapping everything that was there, I did in adb shell : <code>cp -a /system/app /sdcard/</code><br />
and back later.<br />
So after following all the other installation steps, I had cyanogenmod booting. I attached a bluetooth keyboard so that I can better type. The ROM comes with a terminal app, which I opened. type <code>su -</code> to become root after a security popup.<br />
Now, I downloaded my lastest Raspberry-Pi image from <a href="http://www.zq1.de/bernhard/linux/opensuse/">http://www.zq1.de/bernhard/linux/opensuse/</a>. This is under /sdcard/Download where I unpacked it with xz -d<br />
Then comes the tricky part. The image has a partition table, but here we just need the root filesystem. With <code>fdisk -lu</code> we can see that it starts at sector 309248. One could copy out that part with dd or use a loop device with offset like this:<br />
<code>#!/system/xbin/sh<br />
mknod /dev/loop0 b 7 0<br />
losetup -d /dev/loop0 # cleanup of previous try<br />
losetup -o `expr 512 \* 309248` /dev/loop0 rasp*img<br />
mkdir -p mnt<br />
mount -t ext2 /dev/loop0 mnt<br />
</code></p>
<p>Now we have access to the openSUSE files under mnt.<br />
In there I created me a chroot.sh:<br />
<code>#!/system/xbin/sh<br />
for m in proc sys dev ; do    mount -o bind /$m $m ; done<br />
HOME=/root PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/sbin:/root/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/X11R6/bin /system/xbin/chroot . bin/bash<br />
for m in proc sys dev ; do    umount $m ; done<br />
</code></p>
<p>With that, the only remaining thing to do was to add a nameserver line to /etc/resolv.conf before I could use zypper to install software e.g. <code>zypper install yast2-network yast2-ncurses</code>.<br />
Running <code>yast lan</code> on the Nexus 7 <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/108928462394474625418/albums/5701558097275278593/5926357383234418210">gives nice sight</a>.</p>
<p>I guess one could also use <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/ports/armv7hl/distribution/12.3/images/openSUSE-12.3-ARM-JeOS-rootfs.armv7l-1.12.1-Build47.1.tbz">the armv7 rootfs</a> to have software built for armv7 instead of the compatible armv6. But for me it does not matter much.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>update:</strong> new image with kernel-3.6 and minimal X11/icewm http://www.zq1.de/~bernhard/linux/opensuse/raspberrypi-opensuse-20130911x.img.xz (103MB)</p></blockquote>
<p>We got a new armv6 based image for the Raspberry Pi.<br />
This one is only 82MB compressed, so pretty minimalistic.</p>
<p>http://www.zq1.de/~bernhard/linux/opensuse/raspberrypi-opensuse-20130907.img.xz</p>
<p>The exciting new thing is that this was created using an alternative image building automatism which I wrote from scratch in three hours this morning.<br />
The scripts can be found at</p>
<p>https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:ARM:Factory:Contrib:RaspberryPi/altimagebuild</p>
<p>and are also embedded within the image under /home/abuild/rpmbuild/SOURCES/</p>
<p>This means that everyone can now easily build his own images the way he likes and even branch and do submit requests for changes that are useful for others.<br />
The way to use this is simple.<br />
If you have 6GB RAM, you can speed things up with export OSC_BUILD_ROOT=/dev/shm/arm before you do<br />
<code>osc co devel:ARM:Factory:Contrib:RaspberryPi altimagebuild<br />
cd devel:ARM:Factory:Contrib:RaspberryPi/altimagebuild<br />
bash -x main.sh<br />
</code></p>
<p>This pseudo-package does not easily build within OBS or osc alone because it needs root permissions for some of the steps (chroot, mknod, mount), which could only be workarounded with User-Mode-Linux or patching osc.<br />
The build consists of three steps that can be seen in main.sh:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, osc build is used to pull in required packages and setup the armv6 rootfs.</li>
<li>Second, mkrootfs.sh modifies a copy of the rootfs under .root to contain all required configs</li>
<li>And finally, mkimage.sh takes the .root dir and creates a .img from it that can be booted</li>
</ol>
<p>This can build an image from scatch in three minutes. And my Raspberry Pi booted successfully with it within 55 seconds.</p>
<p>There are some remaining open issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>the repo key is initially untrusted</li>
<li><del datetime="2013-09-11T09:01:03+00:00">still uses old 3.1 kernel</del> &#8211; solved</li>
<li>build scripts have no error handling</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to the old image, this one has some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easier to resize because the root partition is the last one</li>
<li>Compressed image is much smaller</li>
<li>Reproducible image build, so easy to customize</li>
<li>It is armv6 with floating point support, so could be faster</li>
<li>We have over 5200 successfully built packages from <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/ports/armv6hl/factory/repo/oss/">openSUSE:Factory:ARM</a><br />
so for example you can install a minimalistic graphical environment with <code>zypper install xauth twm xorg-x11-server xinit</code> and start it with <code>startx</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you wanted to play with openSUSE on RPi, you can do so right now and have a lot of fun.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above. And adventurous users who know how to deal with troubles.<br />
The majority could easily wait the final release, expected somewhat later.
</p>
<p>This is experimental &amp; BETA sofware, it could fix issues you encountered, but also can eat your kitten. You&#8217;ve been warned !<br />
But good reports have been collected around, especially with never 3.10x kernel series.
</p>
<h3>Installing the new repository</h3>
<p>Admitting you&#8217;ve the normal repository named FGLRX, (use zypper lr -d to find the number or name you give it). You have to start by disabling it, so you could fallback to it quickly. Open a root console or add sudo at your convenience and issue the following command:</p>
<pre>zypper mr -dR FGLRX</pre>
<p>The beta driver is available for 11.4 (evergreen kernel), 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 13.1, Tumbleweed (12.3 based + kernel 3.10) at <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/amd-fgrlx-beta/">amd-fglrx-beta</a></p>
<p>To add another repository in the same console as root issue the following command which will install normally the right repository for your distribution</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_`lsb-release -r | awk '{print $2}'` FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p><b>If you are using Tumbleweed</b> use this one</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_Tumbleweed FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Now the update/upgrade process</p>
<pre>zypper dup -r FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Let the system upgrade the package, and try to enjoy the new beta</p>
<p><span id="more-9757"></span></p>
<h2>Release note about 13.8 BETA1 and new repository</h2>
<p>
This BETA Catalyst fglrx version support openSUSE version from 11.4 to 13.1 (new repository) and also Tumbleweed (thus also kernel 3.10x series).<br />
<br />
We create a new repository, to avoid any mix between stable and beta. If you want to try it, you will have to disable the amd-fglrx, and install the<br />
new repository. Also the signer of package have change and use now the generic builder gpg key at Ioda-Net. (gpg key id 65BE584C)
