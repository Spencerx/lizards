				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have time to setup real solution and need something reliable test Zabbix (<a href="http://zabbix.com" title="Zabbix">http://zabbix.com</a>). Zabbix is wonderful all in one solutions for monitoring network and your hosts (servers). If you are in need of knowing how good you Internet/(W)LAN connections is then things are getting complicated.<span id="more-10639"></span><br />
Case is like this: You have computer and WIFI-card (Wireless Internet card). Most of the time it&#8217;s working great! Speed is high and there is no hick-ups any kind. Out of the blue comes troubles. In other network video is not playing from net or you keep getting connection errors in browser.. so what to do? How to debug this one? It can be that other people are just consuming all the router bandwidth available or there is many WIFI routers in same frequency (be sure to check first all the hardware before getting into software level). If hardware is not the case and you have double checked with normal Wire connection to Internet/LAN then there is definitely something else. With WIFI connection it still can be your grandma’s old beloved 1950 microwave oven (If you on 5Ghz band then you can&#8217;t blame her either)..<br />
So I assume you are on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP" title="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a>-network if you don&#8217;t know what it is you should first find out and then read the rest of this story.<br />
WIFI-cards have signal strength monitor. I have notice that many times it&#8217;s just a estimation. You can have 100% strength and your connection is next to nothing. Manufacturers tends to make connections look way too better than they are or they make them look even worst than they are.<br />
So how to find out is my connection good or bad? Word of warning in this point: this is just one way to find out and it&#8217;s not very good (for some use cases it is). Way is to use little bit BASH (Bourne Again SHell) and <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Ping-in-Linux" title="ping">ping-command</a> which is installed in openSUSE default.</p>
<h2>What ping does</h2>
<p>Ping consumes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol" title="ICMP">ICMP-protocol</a> which is very low level and I don&#8217;t know is it used for anything anymore these days (correct me if I&#8217;m very wrong) only with ping-command. If Wikipedia is correct ping calculates round-trip so how long takes data to find it&#8217;s way to server and come back (Small tip here! You can use <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/unix/utracero.htm" title="Traceroute">traceroute</a> to see how you packet is finding it&#8217;s way on the Internet and back to you).<br />
So how can I use ping to tell me is my server up? Short answer is simple: &#8216;you can&#8217;t&#8217;. Little bit longer answer: &#8216;Yes you can but it&#8217;s little bit more complicated than you first thought&#8217; and the long version: &#8216;You get information about if your server&#8217;s network card answers to (and most of the time kernel network stack) received ICMP-packet. If there is firewall rule that turns ICMP-packet answer off you are out of luck. Ping doesn&#8217;t tell if your service is up or Apache running correctly and reliable. Remember ping answer can work even if most of user space is smashed down and kernel is malfunctioning (been there done that!)&#8217;.<br />
So what you get it answer from network card and that&#8217;s it. If it&#8217;s enough (99% times it is) keep reading.</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>Show me code you scream and I give it to you and please read comments on code before using. This is edited version from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18258364/ping-tool-to-check-if-server-is-online" title="Stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow.com</a> message script (so nothing original here):</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

echo "Press [CTRL+C] to stop.."

# Make at least 10 pings in one time
COUNT=50
SUCCESS=0
LASTFAIL=NONE
# Change this to Domain name/IP
# or ip you want to monitor
IP=192.168.1.1
FAILS=0

while true
do
        #
        # Ping with interval 0.5s to IP (192.168.1.1)
        # COUNT (50) times
        # after that we just grep 'byte from' from output
        # or ping and them calculate how many we got
        # with wc -l (Lines of output) bacause we drop
        # other from output
        # You can use up (normally) 2000 size (-s) of package
        # to see if it's starts to drop..
        LINES=$(ping -s 1024 -i 0.5 -c ${COUNT} ${IP} | \
                grep "bytes from ${SERVERSERVER}" | wc -l)

        # Calculate how many fails there were
        let FAILS=${COUNT}-${LINES}+${FAILS}
        # Add to success rate
        let SUCCESS=${LINES}+${SUCCESS}

        # If there were error but date to LASTFAIL
        # so if you not every moment looking you can
        # see when this error happened
        if [ ${LINES} -ne ${COUNT} ]; then
             LASTFAIL=$(date)
        fi

        # Ok ping all together failed
        if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then
          echo "Can't Connect to server ${IP}"
        else
          # Print statistics to screen
          echo "$(date) ${IP} Success: ${LINES} (Tot. F ${FAILS}) \
(Tot. S ${SUCCESS}) (Last F ${LASTFAIL})"
        fi

        # Sleep a while (not consume all the bandwidth)
        sleep 1
done
</pre>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Script prints mystical output. Things that matters that Success rate is 50 (or what pinging rate you are using) and Fails are not rising fast. It they are rising fast packets are dropped if you are not getting anything check IP/domain name. With this one you can get ping time. If success level is 50 but ping time is high you network is still very slow but that you have to check with ping-command by hand. Even with 2G mobile modem you should get under 300ms (3G should be like 100ms).<br />
To have any clue about your connection you have make this at least 30 minutes (First ping packets can tell everything but if you want to see whole picture). Actually this is stupid way to find out is your server up but if your WIFI-card  is working everywhere else great you can check are you packets going through. If ICMP-packets are dropping very fast then your TCP/IP packages are dropping very fast and you network stack have to re-send them so you notice that your network is slow (even though it has nothing to do with that). Again it can be route, WIFI-card or firewall problem still.. and ping doesn&#8217;t answer to that question. So this was this days script stuff. If you have better ways to do this.. please share I&#8217;m always interested in this topic.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The x86_64 edition of openSUSE Education&#8217;s <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e" title="Li-f-e">Li-f-e</a> live DVD supports PXE booting the iso over the network, here is how to do it:</p>
<p>* Install Li-f-e (Switch to GRUB from Installation Summary page if your hardware does not support EFI boot ), make sure you have plenty of space assigned to / partition(about 20G)<br />
* Set up LTSP by following this <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:LTSP%20quick%20start%2012.2%20Edu" title="LTSP Quick Start">quick start guide</a><br />
* Create /srv/nfs folder and copy Li-f-e iso there<br />
* Run the following as root in terminal:<br />
<code><br />
mount /srv/nfs/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e.x86_64-13.1.1.iso /mnt<br />
cp /mnt/boot/x86_64/loader/linux /srv/tftpboot/boot/linux-life64<br />
cp /mnt/boot/x86_64/loader/initrd /srv/tftpboot/boot/initrd-life64<br />
echo "/srv/nfs *(ro,no_root_squash,async,no_subtree_check)" &gt;&gt; /etc/exports<br />
cat &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt; /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default<br />
LABEL Li-f-e<br />
kernel boot/linux-life64<br />
append initrd=boot/initrd-life64 isofrom_device=nfs:10.0.0.254:/srv/nfs/ isofrom_system=/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e.x86_64-13.1.1.iso nonm<br />
IPAPPEND 2<br />
EOF<br />
chkconfig rpcbind on &amp;&amp; service rpcbind restart<br />
chkconfig nfsserver on &amp;&amp; service nfsserver restart<br />
</code><br />
Now you can PXE boot any machine over the network, select Li-f-e from the end of the boot menu to boot live DVD iso instead of normal LTSP session.</p>
<p>Please note that if you install Li-f-e booted over the network then after the installation  you will need to remove &#8220;nonm&#8221; boot option using yast2 bootloader to get NetworkManager working again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well openSUSE 12.3 is about to go live  and we are all pretty excited. It is, as far as I can tell a rock solid release and we have outdone ourselves. Considering the short release cycle makes this even more impressive.</p>
<p>One can only thank everyone in the community for pulling together, getting a lot of stuff done and delivering a great release.</p>
<p>Yet, there&#8217;s one sprinkle that rains on our parade. While we completed the switch to systemd we somewhere along the lines forgot to check the status of NetworkManager on an installed system. Thus, when you upgrade from a previous release and NetworkManager is disabled, it will be enabled and running after the upgrade is complete, sorry. If you happen to be running a network bridge your bridge will not be working and you&#8217;ll end up in some weird network state where <em>ifconfig</em> will tell you that both your bridge and your Ethernet card have an IP address. Your routing table will also be messed up. Addressing the issue is easy.</p>
<p>Login as root, which you will have to do at the login manager if you happen to run NIS, disable NetworkManager, stop the NetworkManager service, and restart your network. You are now back to your original configuration, no sweat <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  . Below is a list of commands you want to run as the root user to make this happen:</p>
<p># systemctl &#8211;force disable NetworkManager.service</p>
<p># systemctl stop NetworkManager.service</p>
<p># rcnetwork restart</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, came across <a title="x2go home" href="http://x2go.org">x2go</a> packages maintained by<a title="People of openSUSE" href="http://news.opensuse.org/2009/04/23/people-of-opensuse-jan-engelhardt/"> Jan Engelhardt</a> for openSUSE and other distributions on <a title="X11:RemoteDesktop:x2go" href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=X11:RemoteDesktop:x2go">open build service</a>. As <a title="Li-f-e" href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">openSUSE Education Li-f-e</a> has great <a title="LTSP home" href="http://ltsp.org">LTSP</a> integration thanks to<a title="KIWI-LTSP on openSUSE wiki" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI-LTSP"> KIWI-LTSP</a>, I decided to check out how x2go can fit in with this existing thin-client computing solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;x2go is an open (<acronym title="GNU General Public License">GPL</acronym>/AGPL) source “server based computing” project. Combining the advantages of existing systems it features ease of use, performance and scalability. x2go provides you with access to your desktop &#8211; from within your own network and via the internet. x2go is not limited to particular hardware, it supports a variety of devices and architectures.&#8221; -from their website.</p>
<p>Some of the features/benefits of x2go that are not available on LTSP are:</p>
<p>* Remote login from within local lan and internet from any OS<br />
* Session persistence, you can disconnect session from one client and continue where you left off from any other client<br />
* Low bandwidth usage<br />
* Session sharing with other users<br />
<span id="more-9029"></span><br />
Apart from these, x2go also supports sound redirection via pulseaudio, folder sharing for access to local disks similar to LTSP.</p>
<p>I would personally still prefer LTSP session in local network, and as x2goserver and LTSP server can coexist on same server we can choose x2goclient to connect over the internet and log in using LTSP in local lan.</p>
<p>Here is how to run x2go as kiosk session by PXE booting a thin-client/PC/laptop.</p>
<p>* Install <a title="kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go" href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go">kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go</a> on openSUSE Edu Li-f-e or 12.2 via <a title="Install via 1-click" href="http://software.opensuse.org/ymp/server:ltsp/openSUSE_12.2/kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go.ymp">1-click from here</a>.<br />
* Run <code>kiwi-ltsp -ln openSUSE_12_2_x2go</code> as root to create KIWI-LTSP image that is used for PXE booting clients, (this step requires fast internet connection and about 250M download)<br />
* Run <code>kiwi-ltsp -c</code> to configure required services<br />
* Add the following to<strong><em> /srv/tftpboot/KIWI/root.default/etc/lts.conf</strong></em>  under [default] for all clients or under [MA:CA:DD:RE:SS] for a particular client and boot up the client, openSUSE_12_2_x2go will be available at the end of boot menu.<br />
<code><br />
        SCREEN_07=kiosk<br />
        KIOSK_EXE="/usr/bin/x2goclient --no-menu --maximize --link=lan --geometry=fullscreen --thinclient --haltbt --no-session-edit  --add-to-known-hosts"<br />
        KIOSKUSER=x2goclient<br />
 </code></p>
<p>You can also have normal LTSP session on tty8 along with this by adding <code>SCREEN_08=ldm</code>. To connect to the server from non-thin-client install and run x2goclient.</p>
<p>You can simply poweroff the client without the need to disconnect or do normal shutdown.</p>
<p>Note: this method of using x2go is just for testing and development purpose, you can use x2goserver and x2goclient in a standalone mode without kiwi-ltsp bits. Nothing additional than installing x2goserver package is needed to setup the server, except firewall should allow access to ssh port(22). </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people want to provide a collection of files, they sometimes choose to do so by providing a .iso image file. But if you only want to look what files are in there or only need a few files, e.g. kernel and initrd for PXE-booting, you still had to download the whole thing to loop-mount it.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t have to anymore. Because modern web servers support delivering only parts of a file (using the &#8220;Range&#8221; header field), that allowed me to implement curlwwwfs that mounts remote HTTP directories into your local filesystem. And then you can use fuseiso on top to access the actual content within the .iso. All without root access.</p>
<p>This is how it works:</p>
<p>First you have to install the required packages (replace 12.2 with your version of openSUSE (or if you use a different Linux distribution, do git clone git://github.com/bmwiedemann/curlwwwfs and &#8220;make install&#8221; in there)):</p>
<p>zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/bmwiedemann/openSUSE_12.2/home:bmwiedemann.repo</p>
<p>zypper in curlwwwfs fuseiso</p>
<p># Then you start it:</p>
<p>mkdir mnthttp mntiso</p>
<p>curlwwwfs http://zq1.de/bootcd mnthttp &amp;</p>
<p>ls -la mnthttp/</p>
<p>fuseiso mnthttp/bmwinux-8.2-040808.iso mntiso</p>
<p>cat mntiso/isolinux/isolinux.cfg</p>
<p># and later you clean it up with</p>
<p>fusermount -u mntiso</p>
<p>fusermount -u mnthttp</p>

<p>squidview is one of the software, I&#8217;ve always build and installed on each squid proxy server I build for me or customers. It&#8217;s small, stable, and usefull. So it was a clear real nice candidate to be use to improve my <a href="http://openbuild-system.org">obs</a> and packager skiil.<br />
I would like to thanks T1loc, yaloki, mrdocs, coolo, alin, and all others great packagers around, for helping and teaching me during the process.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Squidview is an interactive console program which monitors and displays squid logs in a nice fashion, and may then go deeper with searching and reporting functions.</p>
<p>(If you don&#8217;t know what squid is or does this program is probably not for you.)</p>
<p>To use squidview you must at least have read access to squid&#8217;s access.log file. You may need to see your administrator for this. Squidview uses this text log file for all operations. It does not generate its own database for tasks.
</p>
<p>homepage <a href="http://www.rillion.net/squidview/">www.rillion.net/squidview</a></p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>
Squidview has a number of functions. Navigate the log file with the cursor pad keys, jump to a certain day or switch to a different log file. Search for text or large http/ftp requests.</p>
<p>Put squidview into monitor mode: see the latest activity updated every 3 seconds (this is light on cpu load).</p>
<p>Reports can be generated listing the heavist Internet users and the most popular visited sites. See how many cache hits squid makes to save network traffic.</p>
<p>Squidview is released under the GPL.
</p>
<h3>Examples / Usage</h3>

<h2>Installation / Repositories</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve just made a submit request against openSUSE_Factory to get it included directly, but in the meantime, you could install it from the repository server:proxy as many other useful &amp; related packages</p>
<p>For example adding the repository under openSUSE_Factory</p>
<pre>
zypper ar -c -f -n "server:proxy" http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/proxy/openSUSE_Factory "server:proxy"
zypper in squidview
</pre>
<h3>Builds available for :</h3>
<p>The package is build successfully against : SLES10, SLES11, openSUSE 11.3 to Factory</p>
<p>Have Fun!</p>

<ol>
<li>start the yast2 DSL module</li>
<li>follow the instructions of the wizard to set up a new PPPoE device. Enter your user name and password at the provider screen.</li>
<li>At the &#8220;Connection Parameters&#8221; screen uncheck &#8220;Automatically Retrieve DNS&#8221;. Enter an arbitrary IPv4 address as first DNS server (yast doesn&#8217;t accept IPv6 there yet, bug 665516).</li>
<li>finish the wizard and leave yast</li>
<li>open /etc/sysconfig/network/providers/provider0 (or whatever name was chosen by yast) in an editor</li>
<li>change DNS1 and DNS2 to the actual IPv6 addresses of your provider&#8217;s name servers</li>
<li>add the following line to the file:<br />
	<code>PPPD_OPTIONS="noip +ipv6 ipv6cp-accept-local"</code>
	</li>
<li>save and quit</li>
<li>Done! You may now use cinternet or qinternet to dial in and enjoy the (rather empty) IPv6 internet.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hackweek</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that time of the year when SUSE/Novell developers use their Innovation Time-off to do a project of their interest/wish &#8211; called as Hackweek. Last week was Hackweek V. I worked on making the Common Internet File System (CIFS) cache aware, i.e. local caching for CIFS Network File System.</p>
<p>Linux FS-Cache</p>
<p>Caching can result in performance improvements in network filesystems where access to network and media is slow. The cache can indirectly improve performance of the network and the server by reduced network calls. Caching can be also viewed as a preparatory work for making disconnected operation (Offline) work with network filesystems.</p>
<p>The Linux Kernel recently added a generic caching facility (FS-Cache) that any network filesystem like NFS or CIFS or other service can use to cache data locally. FS-Cache supports a variety of cache backends i.e. different types of cache that have different trade-offs (like CacheFiles, CacheFS etc.) FS-Cache mediates between cache backends and the network filesystems. Some of the network filesystems such as NFS and AFS are already integrated with FS-Cache.</p>
<p>Making CIFS FS-Cache capable</p>
<p>To make any network filesystem FS-Cache aware, there are a few things to consider. Let&#8217;s consider them step by step (though not in detail):</p>
<p>* First, we need to define the network filesystem and it should be able to register/unregister with the FS-Cache interface.<br />
* The network filesystem has to define the index hierarchy which could be used to locate a file object or discard a certain subset of all the files cached.<br />
* We need to define the objects and the methods associated.<br />
* All the indices in the index hierarchy and the data file need to be registered. This could be done by requesting a cookie for each index or data file. Upon successful registration, a corresponding cookie is returned.<br />
* Functions to store and retrieve pages in the cache.<br />
* Way to identify whether the cache for a file is valid or not.<br />
* Function to release any in-memory representation for the network filesystem page.<br />
* Way to invalidate a data file or index subtree and relinquish cookies.</p>
<p>Implementation</p>
<p>I wanted to get the prototype working within a week. So the way I have implemented it is rudimentary and has lot of room for improvement.</p>
<p>The index hierarchy is not very deep. It has three levels &#8211; Server, Share and Inode. The only way that I know of identifying files with CIFS is by &#8216;UniqueId&#8217; which is supposed to be unique. However, some server do not ensure that the &#8216;UniqueId&#8217; is always unique (for example when there is more than one filesystem in the exported share). The cache coherency is currently ensured by verifying the &#8216;LastWriteTime&#8217; and size of the file. This is not a reliable way of detecting changes as some CIFS servers will not update the time until the filehandle is closed.</p>
<p>The rudimentary implementation is ready and the cumulative patch can be found here:</p>
<p>http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jays/patches/</p>
<p>[WARNING: The patch is lightly tested and of prototype quality.]</p>
<p>Here are some initial performance numbers with the patch:</p>
<p>Copying one big file of size ~150 MB.</p>
<p>$time cp /mnt/cifs/amuse.zip .<br />
(Cache initialized)</p>
<p>real 1m18.603s<br />
user 0m0.016s<br />
sys 0m8.569s</p>
<p>$time cp /mnt/cifs/amuse.zip /<br />
(Read from Cache)</p>
<p>real 0m28.055s<br />
user 0m0.008s<br />
sys 0m1.140s</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi developers!</p>
<p>These are first hours of hackweek. A lot of people in Novell and in the community are starting to work on different projects. What can I give for free software in this week? Sure, my favorite project is NetworkManagement.</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pnm1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5373" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pnm1.png" alt="" width="650" height="346" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, NetworkManagement don&#8217;t work well. For example, it can&#8217;t see WiFi connection and don&#8217;t show wired connetcion. Yes, right now we have one bug with module &#8220;networkmanagement&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p>This module must be loaded after start NetworkManagement, but this is not happening <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>If you check it, you will see:</p>
<pre>anaumov@pizza:~/plasma/networkmanagement&gt; qdbus --system org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerUserSettings
Service 'org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerUserSettings' does not exist.</pre>
<p>Why it&#8217;s happening? Problem is in connection between plasmoid and deamon NM (via DBus).</p>
<pre>anaumov@pizza:~/plasma/networkmanagement&gt; qdbus org.kde.kded /kded loadModule networkmanagement
true
anaumov@pizza:~/plasma/networkmanagement&gt; qdbus --system org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerUserSettings
/
/org
/org/freedesktop
/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings
/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/0
/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/1
/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/2
/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/3
/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/4
/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/5
/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/6
/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/7
/org/freedesktop/NetworkManagerSettings/8
anaumov@pizza:~/plasma/networkmanagement&gt;</pre>
<p>So, now we can see WiFi interface:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pnm11.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5375" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pnm11.png" alt="" width="650" height="340" /></a></p>
<p>And WiFi interface can see WiFi connections:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pnm2.png"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/pnm2.png" alt="" width="650" height="338" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5377" /></a></p>
<p>Good, but this works not automaticly. It&#8217;s first what I want to hack on this week.</p>
<p>And what do you want to do on this week? <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
