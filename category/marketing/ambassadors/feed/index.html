				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2012/02/opensuse-travel-support-program.html"><img class="alignright" alt="Introduction blog of the TSP" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z2C53Ezpreo/TzmSHow4-MI/AAAAAAAACOQ/qqlEUg8SCI0/s320/Virginia+Lin+Photography.jpg" width="320" height="240" /></a><br />
Today, <em>Ancor Gonzalez Sosa</em> writes about the Travel Support Program Application he developed with the openSUSE Team.</p>
<p>Traveling to an event to represent your project, sharing experiences with other people with common interests and showing them what you are passionate about is absolutely awesome &#8211; but it can get expensive. This is why openSUSE <a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2012/02/opensuse-travel-support-program.html">introduced a Travel Support Program</a> last year.</p>
<h2>The openSUSE Travel Support Program</h2>
<p>The goal of the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program">Travel Support Program</a> is to support contributors representing openSUSE at events by reimbursing up to 80% of the travel and/or hotel costs. In turn the contributors make a worthy contribution at the event and report back to the openSUSE community about what they did.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not alone in doing this, having drawn inspiration from <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Travel">GNOME&#8217;s Conference Travel Subsidy Program</a>, the <a href="http://ev.kde.org/rules/reimbursement_policy.php">KDE e.V. Travel Cost Reimbursement initiative</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/TDF/Policies/Travel">Travel Policy from The Document Foundation</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_9509" style="width: 277px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/vanilla-entering-reimbursement-request.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9512 " alt="vanilla entering reimbursement request_crop" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/vanilla-entering-reimbursement-request_crop-267x300.png" width="267" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">entering reimbursement request</p></div>
<p>The program is sponsored by SUSE, but the Travel Committee independently manages the money and decides who is supported and how. This is a lot of work: decisions involve the event itself, the contributor asking for support, other Geekos in the area, the costs and of course the entire budget. The team also has to plan the priority of events with the marketing team and communicate about the status of the requests and reimbursement.</p>
<p>And the Free Software world was lacking a proper tool to manage all this&#8230; until now!</p>
<h2>The brand new TSP application</h2>
<p>We developed a new web tool to make the life of the TSP team and the community easier and do this in an open and generic way so other projects could benefit as well. We&#8217;ve started using it already for the upcoming <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org">openSUSE Conference 2013</a> and you can see it in action <a href="https://connect.opensuse.org/travel-support/">here</a>. It even offers a pretty diagram explaining the TSP process! Of course, the complete source code of the project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/travel-support-program">Github</a>.</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>For a more detailed explanation of the goals of the project you can refer to the &#8216;<a href="http://board.opensuse.org/projects/travel-support-program-management/wiki/About_TSP_application">about the TSP application</a>&#8216; page in our projects management tool. In that page you will find &#8216;the 6 Ws&#8217; of the new application: who, what, when, where, why and how (yes, we know that &#8216;how&#8217; does not start with &#8216;W&#8217;, but we didn&#8217;t invented the 6Ws term).</p>
<p>During development we honored the motto &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">release early, release often</a>&#8221; and worked following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile development</a> principles. We begun by collecting ideas and requirements of the TSP team and the people handling the payments on the SUSE side. After developing a first prototype, it was presented in a video conference. You can find the <a href="https://board.opensuse.org/projects/travel-support-program-management wiki/Meeting_2013-03-26">minutes of this meeting</a> in the project&#8217;s wiki.</p>
<p>Once the feedback was in and new goals were set, the prototype was deployed on a provisional server in order for the Travel Committee to test it. Using this test-drive installation, the application was improved in an interactive way. Every two weeks (sometimes a bit longer), a new version was installed. Izabel tested the new version providing very useful feedback used to plan the new milestone in our <a href="https://board.opensuse.org">projects management tool</a> and so on. This cycle is still in motion: new version, feedback, planning, new version&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_9515" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bento-request-status.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9518 " alt="bento style request status" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bento-request-status_crop2-300x189.png" width="300" height="189" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">bento themed request status</p></div>
<h3>Awesome Rails goodies</h3>
<p>While working on the TSP application we have developed some features that can be interesting for other Ruby on Rails programmers working within the openSUSE infrastructure, like the team behind OSEM. The TSP application includes a <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> backend for the openSUSE authentication infrastructure, a <a href="http://www.designmadeingermany.de/webdesign/communities/opensuse-bento-theme/">Bento theme</a> for <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> (written in pure Less) and integration with <a href="https://connect.opensuse.org">openSUSE Connect</a> through <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Connect_API">its REST API</a>. We plan to release all these features as individual components to allow reuse in other openSUSE developments.</p>
<h3>Present and future, sharing with others</h3>
<p>We plan on continuing maintenance of the application and as with most free software projects, it&#8217;s hard to predict in which direction the tool is going to evolve. Conference volunteers in charge of the visa invitation letters and the team in charge of merchandising shipping already made some interesting suggestions so it will not be a surprise if we end up developing a full event management tool. Not for registration and scheduling individual conferences -the oSC&#8217;13 guys are already doing a great job developing <a href="https://conference.opensuse.org/osem">OSEM</a>- but for the administrative tasks and planning behind the attending various events that communities like openSUSE do.</p>
<h2>Concluding</h2>
<p>So, if you are an openSUSE contributor and you might need sponsorship for traveling in the future, <a href="https://connect.opensuse.org/travel-support/">bookmark the TSP page</a>! If you are a Ruby on Rails developer, just <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/travel-support-program">Fork it on Github™</a> and meet us at oSC&#8217;13 to talk about future collaboration. And if you are in charge of a travel support program for another open source project or are thinking about the possibility of starting one, you can run it yourself and we&#8217;d be happy to help you in case of trouble. You can find me (Ancor Gonzalez Sosa) as ancorgs in the <a href="irc://freenode.net/#opensuse-project">openSUSE-Project</a> channel on <a href="http://freenode.net">Freenode</a>.</p>
<p>And always remember: have a lot of fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the risk of stepping on other people&#8217;s toes let me apologize before I start. I am certain we have many members in the community that have gone out of their way to overcome hurdles placed in their way by our &#8220;organization&#8221; or others. I was inspired by this story because it shows how dedicated our community members are and it really fits well with some of the issues we are still struggling with in the transition from Boosters to SUSE team and the transition between initiatives, Ambassadors to Coordinators and shipping of DVDs to boxes of promo material for designated events.</p>
<p>Peter Czanik was caught in the middle of all of this at a recent FSF conference where he and others had an openSUSE booth. With no DVDs being shipped, due to the transition in the promo material shipping procedure (this has been announced) and no money available through TSP for local production of marketing materials due to a snafu (a temporary solution is in the works) there was basically no help from the resources where help should be coming from, sorry about that Peter.</p>
<p>Despite these obstacles Peter and the team showed up and made due with what was available to have great success. In Peter&#8217;s words:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;"&#8221;<br />
<em>- distributed the last few remaining openSUSE 12.2 DVDs. Many people complained, that it&#8217;s not the latest and greatest, but also many were happy, as they have an old machine and older Linux versions usually have lower resource requirements.</em><br />
<em>- reused the posters we printed last autumn to decorate the booth (at the end of the day they were in a sorry state, so can&#8217;t be reused any more&#8230;)</em><br />
<em>- used the few remaining openSUSE brochures, stickers we printed last year (printing was contributed last year by somebody working at a printing company and our company printer&#8230;)</em></p>
<p><em>- used my ARM machines and a few borrowed mini PCs to demo openSUSE and make the booth eye catching (people asked about the machines and went away with openSUSE DVDs and brochures )</em></p>
<p><em>So, in short: last autumn we had local contributions from community members, this year we used what was last few bits of it and some creativity.</em></p>
<p><em>The good thing is, that I was told from multiple directions, that openSUSE had the best booth among software projects at the conference (and they did not know, that it was from a ZERO budget&#8230;).</em></p>
<p><em>The bad thing is, that we don&#8217;t have any marketing materials left. No DVDs, posters or brochures.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;"&#8221;"</p>
<p>There is no need to rose color the situation, leaving community members trying to represent openSUSE at a conference stranded like this should not happen and there is no excuse for creating this situation in the first place. Work is proceeding to address these issue. However, I want to focus on the positive, and that is undoubtedly how determined Peter and the team were to make the conference a success and how they overcame the obstacles presented to them.</p>
<p>Thank you Peter and team fro being such dedicated representatives of our community and project. Also thank you for pointing out the shortcomings in our current transition period. This will allow us to address these, hopefully in short order.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, am am certain many of you have similar stories to tell. Thanks for your efforts as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you feel as an open source developer, user, or enthusiast if you see this beautiful piece of software is used by hundred of schools and thousand of students? Great isn&#8217;t it? And that&#8217;s what happened here in a small dot on this earth in <a title="Yogyakarta Special Region" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta_%28special_region%29" target="_blank">Yogyakarta Indonesia</a>.</p>
<p>This program was initiated by the Government of Indonesia with the objective to introduce the open source and e-learning method to student and teacher. So three years ago I was contacted to help them to realize their dream, and here I&#8217;m now reporting that there are around 7300 openSUSE installation in <a title="openSUSE in schools" href="http://ict-eqep.com/locations/map_350.html" target="_blank">350 elementary and junior-high schools</a>. We also use SLES in servers to provide repositories and e-learning materials in SCORM using Moodle.  This is work in progress. We educate teachers to use openSUSE and also creating learning material so it is always in beta stage I think <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I want to say thank you to all the good people, my friends and co-workers, they are unknown in openSUSE community, even many of them are not subscribing the mailing list, but they are the true openSUSE ambassadors in Indonesia. They come to schools and persuade the teachers to use openSUSE. Without them this dream will never come true. Picture below show some of them smiling holding the openSUSE 12.1 promo DVD that AJ sent to me. You all great! Also picture of teachers while following our session about openSUSE.</p>

<h3>Imagine it!</h3>
<p>A few months ago, I&#8217;ve started to look for my next car. Then a crazy idea emerged, why not a Geeko&#8217;s car?
</p>
<h3>Find it!</h3>
<p>At that time Gilbert my mechanic <a href="http://www.garagedelavenir.ch" title="Garage de l'avenir">[www]</a> told me that Ford will get a new Fiesta model called Sport+ with a more powerful engine, a new look &amp; feel. I went to the exhibition and made a short test drive. The car was cool. The exhibit model was in blue with 2 white stripes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;clear:both:font-size:small"><span style="color:navy">Blue?</span> <span style="color:green">Green</span> would have been cool isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><span id="more-8048"></span><br />
<div id="attachment_8047" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1149.jpg"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1149-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-8047" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fiesta Sport+ with original stripes</p></div><br />
<h3>Draw it!</h3>
<p>Several weeks have past (Gnome3 launch, DesktopSummit, OSC11 preparation), but the idea stayed in my mind. Good news, the model exist in white with blue stripes too.
<p>After finding a collada model compatible with Blender and pattern for printers coming from ccvision.de (Ford_231 for reference) I started imagine how I can transform it. Playing with demo pictures gimp, blender and inkscape, my project started to look as I wanted : <span style="color:green">green it will be!</span></p>
<h3>Order it!</h3>
<p>
End of August the things became more serious, the old one was on good shape, the price and primes for the new one were all interesting and inside my budget, let&#8217;s order it!<br />
Unfortunately, the delay to get the car and the design done before OSC11 was too short. At least let&#8217;s get the car nude white.</p>
<p>
No need to say that we enjoyed the journey to Nuremberg with the new car.  Okay back home I let the car for two days with the instructions to print it.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold">Gosh the result totally blew my mind!</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>You get an invitation!</h2>
<div id="attachment_8004" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/virtual-p1.jpg"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/virtual-p1-150x150.jpg" alt="Geeko place on SecondLife" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8004" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Geeko place on SecondLife</p></div>
<p>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, months after the first virtual party [1][2][3] organized for 11.4 launch, </p>
<p>Françoise (aka Morgane Marquis) and myself (tigerfoot) organize 3 new parties on SecondLife [4] to welcome and fest our next release openSUSE 12.1, coming around the 11.11.11. </p>
<ul style="font-weight:bold">
<li>Three virtual great Saturday: October 22th, November 12th and December 10th.</li>
<li>From 6 to 8am Australian DJ Ariella is back again.</li>
<li>From 9 to 11am (SL time : utc-9) we will have the pleasure to listen American DJ Esquivel.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should take this opportunity to try Second Life, creating an avatar, coming to dance and drinking some beers with us at Geekos Place.<br />
<span id="more-8003"></span></p>
<p style="clear:both">&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_8005" style="width: 406px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/virtual-p2.jpg"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/virtual-p2.jpg" alt="Linux tribe place" width="396" height="200" class="size-full wp-image-8005" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Geeko in Linux tribe place</p></div>
<h2>What&#8217;s new ?</h2>
<p>From January to march 2011, we did rent a land, which cost much less than in real life, but had a cost. Yes it&#8217;s money and time to organize party, to find good DJ, invite people and for the main point : to get people come to your place. So after 10 great evenings with around 30-40 people, we decided to slow down. In April, we discovered the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">linux tribe sim</span>. The place has been created to promote opensource, and even started recently a learning place (blender, gimp &#8230;).</p>
<p>Finally our Geekos Place is much smaller, but has found a place in the middle of the penguins tribe.<br />
Thanks to them.
</p>
<h2>Second Life (SL) in a few words</h2>
<p>Second Life represent millions of avatars (names and password), but let&#8217;s say about 40 to 60&#8217;000 people are connected at the same time (from USA to Europe, Australia, Africa &#8230;). As most of these visitors have a programmer or design profile, they can&#8217;t stand themselves from buying a land, creating a place, testing new concepts or scripts. So in fact, SL is a huge great creative space &#8230; and seems sometimes like a desert (as less people stand together on a same place).</p>
<h3>Why Second Life ?</h3>
<p>In January, we start looking for open groups on SL &#8230; and we were surprised to see a list of hundred of those. Then we discovered that if some were listing the different Linux distributions, most of them forgot openSUSE. Worst when we arrived on the penguin tribe sim, it seems we fall inside an Ubuntu fan club. We heard that openSUSE was too difficult to install! Beg your pardon ? lol. <br />
Ok, we won&#8217;t go to SL for a competition (in term of fight), but just to be where users and contributors can be!
</p>
<p>Even if SL is not that easy to use, as it need a powerful openGL 3D stack, and specialized client software [5], it&#8217;s a surprising place to visit</p>
<h2>Real and virtual life</h2>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ariella.jpg"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ariella-150x150.jpg" alt="Virtual Party DJ Ariella" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8020" /></a><br />
<a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/esqu.jpg"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/esqu-150x150.jpg" alt="Virtual Party DJ Esquievel" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8021" /></a></p>
<p>We could start a big talk on &quot;what is real or not?&quot; But who cares?</p>
<p>We just invite you to come, try it, Have a lot of fun, and represent openSUSE on a virtual place.</p>
<p>We found 2 great DJ, Ariella from Australia, and Esquievel from the USA. Both are mixing great rock and pleasant music. And we have to remember that they are not paid, except with the tips they receive during the party from you and us. If you are not an addict of SL perhaps you don&#8217;t know that pretty cheap to give generous tips on SL. And each buck earn is really appreciate by the DJ. Think about it!</p>
<p style="clear:both">&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Act Now!</h2>
<p style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center">Can we count on your energy and joy?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t wait the last minute! Create today your avatar, and come as soon as possible, get and wear your free Geeko t-shirt! If you need help to move or to find the place, just <acronym title="Instant message">IM</acronym> Morgane Marquis or Tigerfoot. See or hear you soon.</p>
