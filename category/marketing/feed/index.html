				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/virtual-p1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8004" alt="virtual-p1" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/virtual-p1-300x151.jpg" width="300" height="151" /></a><br />
This edition of the openSUSE Conference is unique in many ways. If you&#8217;ve read the recent blogs by <a href="http://e-tote-kala.blogspot.com/2013/06/organizing-osc13-38-days-before.html">main organizer Kostas</a> and <a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2013/06/osc2013-next.html">openSUSE team member Jos Poortvliet</a> reminiscing about the history of our conference, you know what we mean. Until now the former Boosters (and now openSUSE team) and some other SUSE employees were the core organizers of the event. This year, we&#8217;re in a far more supportive role. In this post we&#8217;d like to detail some of the things we&#8217;ve been working on!</p>
<h2>Finance and administration</h2>
<p>Of course, like previous years, SUSE is the Platinum sponsor of the openSUSE Conference. But we don&#8217;t just give money, we help spend it. We provide administrative and legal support to the organization team, helping execute tasks like dealing with providers, venue and sponsorship contracts, payments and more. Several departments at SUSE are involved in these activities internally coordinated by the openSUSE Team at SUSE and in particular by Agustin.</p>
<p>There is an important part of the administrative and financial support provided by SUSE related with the Travel Support Program. The openSUSE Conference is the most relevant community action openSUSE organizes so the workload related with this program increases this time of the year, specially this edition that the financial support has been doubled compared to the previous one. A report about the TSP will be publish during oSC13 by the TSP Comittee so you will get all the details there.</p>
<div id="attachment_9606" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Day3-Monday-041_DSC_7862.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9606" alt="Video editing" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Day3-Monday-041_DSC_7862-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Video editing at oSC12</p></div>
<h2>Technology: video, network</h2>
<p>We are preparing the video coverage for this years oSC like we did it in 2012. That means we are recording all the talks of the three main rooms and we&#8217;ll try to publish them as sooon as possible. However, due to the reduced manpower of this years video team we might not be able to publish them on the day after. We&#8217;re aiming for perhaps during the week after the event.</p>
<p>Additionally we will provide live video and audio streaming of the talks worldwide. So even if you are not able to come to Greece you will able to see the talks you are interested in. And if you&#8217;re at oSC you could even try to attend two talks at once if you bring a video streaming capable device. The local team will try to make sure that the room chairs share questions from people joining remotely with the presenters.</p>
<p>SUSE also provides networking expertise in the form of Lars Vogdt, who&#8217;s also in charge of infrastructure in the Nuremberg and Prague offices and took care of networking for oSC12.</p>
<div id="attachment_9607" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Day1-Saturday-044_DSC_7395.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9607" alt="the openSUSE Booth at oSC12" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Day1-Saturday-044_DSC_7395-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">the openSUSE Booth at oSC12</p></div>
<h2>Marketing and communication</h2>
<p>A conference needs lots of communication over lots of channels and this is where community manager Jos Poortvliet helps out. There&#8217;s of course the main website, set up by Henne Volgelsang. Jos has done a fair bit in writing texts for it as well, helping Henne in maintaining the site with tasks like adding the sponsors when they came in or speakers for the program. Jos has also written or edited the majority of conference articles for news.opensuse.org, announcing things like the start of the travel support program request period, the Call for Papers, the program, sponsors, keynote speakers and more. Some of these were send out on our press channels.</p>
<p>Speaking of Press, Jos has tapped into his pool of press contacts, inviting journalists for the conference, helping to organize Media Partnerships and interviews. At the event, he&#8217;ll take care of the press, help them find people to interview and make sure they have a place to quietly work. He&#8217;ll also coordinate the communication, with help from the local team, making sure we send out tweets, facebook and Google-Plus messages and of course daily articles informing those who didn&#8217;t make it to the event about what is going on.</p>
<div id="attachment_9610" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Day2-Sunday-086_DSC_7685.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9610" alt="oSC12 workshop" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Day2-Sunday-086_DSC_7685-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">oSC12 workshop</p></div>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Michal Hrusecky was active for the openSUSE team on the CfP committee. That was in part due to his expertise as main organizer of the openSUSE Conference 2012 but also because the openSUSE team as a whole is committed to provide content for the conference: each member will perpare presentations and workshops, sharing their knowledge and experience. Michal coordinated this and made sure that if the CfP team saw gaps in the current proposals, the openSUSE team would attempt to provide the desired content. For example, Michal and Jos will provide daily &#8220;<em>how to give awesome presentations</em>&#8221; workshops.</p>
<h2>Just part of the machine</h2>
<p>All these activities represent a small fraction of the effort needed to organize such a conference. The heavy work is done this year by openSUSE community, specially by the local team lead by Kostas and Stella, among others.</p>
<p>The openSUSE Team, together with some other members of the Operation, Services and Communities department, are coordinating and/or executing most of these tasks assigned to SUSE. We are not the only ones, since other SUSE employees involved in openSUSE are helping in many different areas, like usual. But is the community who leads the event organization.</p>
<p>For SUSE, as you can imagine, it is easier to provide support close to any of our offices than in other countries. So we are open to have openSUSE Conference again in Nuremeberg or Prague in the future. In any case, our commitment to the openSUSE Conference is clear no matter where it take place.</p>
<p>The openSUSE community is getting mature so our relation as company with the project has to evolve. This new role that SUSE plays in the openSUSE Conference organization is just another sign of this evolution.</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>And here then the statistics we promised two weeks ago and forgot last week&#8230; The top ~10 contributors to Factory last week, AND the list from the week before!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2012/02/opensuse-travel-support-program.html"><img class="alignright" alt="Introduction blog of the TSP" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z2C53Ezpreo/TzmSHow4-MI/AAAAAAAACOQ/qqlEUg8SCI0/s320/Virginia+Lin+Photography.jpg" width="320" height="240" /></a><br />
Today, <em>Ancor Gonzalez Sosa</em> writes about the Travel Support Program Application he developed with the openSUSE Team.</p>
<p>Traveling to an event to represent your project, sharing experiences with other people with common interests and showing them what you are passionate about is absolutely awesome &#8211; but it can get expensive. This is why openSUSE <a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2012/02/opensuse-travel-support-program.html">introduced a Travel Support Program</a> last year.</p>
<h2>The openSUSE Travel Support Program</h2>
<p>The goal of the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Travel_Support_Program">Travel Support Program</a> is to support contributors representing openSUSE at events by reimbursing up to 80% of the travel and/or hotel costs. In turn the contributors make a worthy contribution at the event and report back to the openSUSE community about what they did.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not alone in doing this, having drawn inspiration from <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Travel">GNOME&#8217;s Conference Travel Subsidy Program</a>, the <a href="http://ev.kde.org/rules/reimbursement_policy.php">KDE e.V. Travel Cost Reimbursement initiative</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/TDF/Policies/Travel">Travel Policy from The Document Foundation</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_9509" style="width: 277px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/vanilla-entering-reimbursement-request.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9512 " alt="vanilla entering reimbursement request_crop" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/vanilla-entering-reimbursement-request_crop-267x300.png" width="267" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">entering reimbursement request</p></div>
<p>The program is sponsored by SUSE, but the Travel Committee independently manages the money and decides who is supported and how. This is a lot of work: decisions involve the event itself, the contributor asking for support, other Geekos in the area, the costs and of course the entire budget. The team also has to plan the priority of events with the marketing team and communicate about the status of the requests and reimbursement.</p>
<p>And the Free Software world was lacking a proper tool to manage all this&#8230; until now!</p>
<h2>The brand new TSP application</h2>
<p>We developed a new web tool to make the life of the TSP team and the community easier and do this in an open and generic way so other projects could benefit as well. We&#8217;ve started using it already for the upcoming <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org">openSUSE Conference 2013</a> and you can see it in action <a href="https://connect.opensuse.org/travel-support/">here</a>. It even offers a pretty diagram explaining the TSP process! Of course, the complete source code of the project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/travel-support-program">Github</a>.</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>For a more detailed explanation of the goals of the project you can refer to the &#8216;<a href="http://board.opensuse.org/projects/travel-support-program-management/wiki/About_TSP_application">about the TSP application</a>&#8216; page in our projects management tool. In that page you will find &#8216;the 6 Ws&#8217; of the new application: who, what, when, where, why and how (yes, we know that &#8216;how&#8217; does not start with &#8216;W&#8217;, but we didn&#8217;t invented the 6Ws term).</p>
<p>During development we honored the motto &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">release early, release often</a>&#8221; and worked following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile development</a> principles. We begun by collecting ideas and requirements of the TSP team and the people handling the payments on the SUSE side. After developing a first prototype, it was presented in a video conference. You can find the <a href="https://board.opensuse.org/projects/travel-support-program-management wiki/Meeting_2013-03-26">minutes of this meeting</a> in the project&#8217;s wiki.</p>
<p>Once the feedback was in and new goals were set, the prototype was deployed on a provisional server in order for the Travel Committee to test it. Using this test-drive installation, the application was improved in an interactive way. Every two weeks (sometimes a bit longer), a new version was installed. Izabel tested the new version providing very useful feedback used to plan the new milestone in our <a href="https://board.opensuse.org">projects management tool</a> and so on. This cycle is still in motion: new version, feedback, planning, new version&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_9515" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bento-request-status.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9518 " alt="bento style request status" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bento-request-status_crop2-300x189.png" width="300" height="189" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">bento themed request status</p></div>
<h3>Awesome Rails goodies</h3>
<p>While working on the TSP application we have developed some features that can be interesting for other Ruby on Rails programmers working within the openSUSE infrastructure, like the team behind OSEM. The TSP application includes a <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> backend for the openSUSE authentication infrastructure, a <a href="http://www.designmadeingermany.de/webdesign/communities/opensuse-bento-theme/">Bento theme</a> for <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> (written in pure Less) and integration with <a href="https://connect.opensuse.org">openSUSE Connect</a> through <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Connect_API">its REST API</a>. We plan to release all these features as individual components to allow reuse in other openSUSE developments.</p>
<h3>Present and future, sharing with others</h3>
<p>We plan on continuing maintenance of the application and as with most free software projects, it&#8217;s hard to predict in which direction the tool is going to evolve. Conference volunteers in charge of the visa invitation letters and the team in charge of merchandising shipping already made some interesting suggestions so it will not be a surprise if we end up developing a full event management tool. Not for registration and scheduling individual conferences -the oSC&#8217;13 guys are already doing a great job developing <a href="https://conference.opensuse.org/osem">OSEM</a>- but for the administrative tasks and planning behind the attending various events that communities like openSUSE do.</p>
<h2>Concluding</h2>
<p>So, if you are an openSUSE contributor and you might need sponsorship for traveling in the future, <a href="https://connect.opensuse.org/travel-support/">bookmark the TSP page</a>! If you are a Ruby on Rails developer, just <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/travel-support-program">Fork it on Github™</a> and meet us at oSC&#8217;13 to talk about future collaboration. And if you are in charge of a travel support program for another open source project or are thinking about the possibility of starting one, you can run it yourself and we&#8217;d be happy to help you in case of trouble. You can find me (Ancor Gonzalez Sosa) as ancorgs in the <a href="irc://freenode.net/#opensuse-project">openSUSE-Project</a> channel on <a href="http://freenode.net">Freenode</a>.</p>
<p>And always remember: have a lot of fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the risk of stepping on other people&#8217;s toes let me apologize before I start. I am certain we have many members in the community that have gone out of their way to overcome hurdles placed in their way by our &#8220;organization&#8221; or others. I was inspired by this story because it shows how dedicated our community members are and it really fits well with some of the issues we are still struggling with in the transition from Boosters to SUSE team and the transition between initiatives, Ambassadors to Coordinators and shipping of DVDs to boxes of promo material for designated events.</p>
<p>Peter Czanik was caught in the middle of all of this at a recent FSF conference where he and others had an openSUSE booth. With no DVDs being shipped, due to the transition in the promo material shipping procedure (this has been announced) and no money available through TSP for local production of marketing materials due to a snafu (a temporary solution is in the works) there was basically no help from the resources where help should be coming from, sorry about that Peter.</p>
<p>Despite these obstacles Peter and the team showed up and made due with what was available to have great success. In Peter&#8217;s words:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;"&#8221;<br />
<em>- distributed the last few remaining openSUSE 12.2 DVDs. Many people complained, that it&#8217;s not the latest and greatest, but also many were happy, as they have an old machine and older Linux versions usually have lower resource requirements.</em><br />
<em>- reused the posters we printed last autumn to decorate the booth (at the end of the day they were in a sorry state, so can&#8217;t be reused any more&#8230;)</em><br />
<em>- used the few remaining openSUSE brochures, stickers we printed last year (printing was contributed last year by somebody working at a printing company and our company printer&#8230;)</em></p>
<p><em>- used my ARM machines and a few borrowed mini PCs to demo openSUSE and make the booth eye catching (people asked about the machines and went away with openSUSE DVDs and brochures )</em></p>
<p><em>So, in short: last autumn we had local contributions from community members, this year we used what was last few bits of it and some creativity.</em></p>
<p><em>The good thing is, that I was told from multiple directions, that openSUSE had the best booth among software projects at the conference (and they did not know, that it was from a ZERO budget&#8230;).</em></p>
<p><em>The bad thing is, that we don&#8217;t have any marketing materials left. No DVDs, posters or brochures.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;"&#8221;"</p>
<p>There is no need to rose color the situation, leaving community members trying to represent openSUSE at a conference stranded like this should not happen and there is no excuse for creating this situation in the first place. Work is proceeding to address these issue. However, I want to focus on the positive, and that is undoubtedly how determined Peter and the team were to make the conference a success and how they overcame the obstacles presented to them.</p>
<p>Thank you Peter and team fro being such dedicated representatives of our community and project. Also thank you for pointing out the shortcomings in our current transition period. This will allow us to address these, hopefully in short order.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, am am certain many of you have similar stories to tell. Thanks for your efforts as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Fosdem + Hackaton</h2>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tail.png" alt="Green Tail" width="256" height="249" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9272" /><br />
As any hackaton, you finish a bit exhausted. but what the hell, how rich was this week!</p>
<p>I will not come back on the long (could we say impressive) list of things done.<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:12.3_marketing_hackaton" title="Marketing Hackaton" target="_blank">Wiki Marketing</a><br />
or <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Artwork_Todo" title="Artwork todo" target="_blank">Artwork todo.</a></p>
<p>A enormous thanks to all participants :<br />
Carlos (victorck), Carlos (CarlosRibeiro), Izabel (IzabelleValverde), Kostas (warldofff), Ilias (zoumpis), Marcel (tux93), Richard (ilmehtar), Michal (|miska|). </p>
<p>Also they deserve a full bunch of applause, thanks to SUSE&#8217;s people!<br />
<br />
Augustin, Jos, Will, Christopher, Adrian, Henne, Jurgen, Kenneth, Cassio, Alberto, Ralf, Roland, James, Jan, Ludwig, Cornelius, Suzanne and at least a big dozen of others&#8230;<br />
<br />
For your clear engagement, your support to empower our community, your advises, your welcomes, and being so kind with the turbulent community&#8217;s Geekos we were&#8230;
</p>
<p><span id="more-9274"></span></p>
<h2>A Time of changes, and new challenges.</h2>
<p>
The motto we choose for our next <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org">conference</a> couldn&#8217;t be more appropriate, &#8220;Power to the Geekos&#8221;!<br />
<br />
What does that mean? Geeko&#8217;s mean you and me, the community members, contributors, lovers.<br />
So Geeko&#8217;s will have to empower themselves and get more and more implicated in the how, what, who, when, where we want to draw our project.<br />
<br />
No excuses, guys &amp; girls, if we can count on a strong partnership with SUSE our main sponsor, we will have to do our part of the job, like in any sane partnership. And this is true with any other sponsors we have already.
</p>
<p>
In a near future we will have to face some of our old daemons, and fix them, whatever they are.<br />
Conference (osc, summit), bugzilla, release cycle and process, factory, evergreen, tumbleweed, membership, goodies &amp; shop, mailing-list, next board election with 4 seats renewal and so on&#8230;<br />
<br />
So if any of those subject sound like a jungle jingle in your brain, be ready to stand up to help the community to grow.
</p>
<p>
Changes will shake for sure our community, but why being afraid or keeping an &#8220;old memory&#8217;s myth&#8221; attitude?<br />
<br />
Together we have the force to drive these changes, in a friendly way, and for the benefit of all. Do we take the risk to see some leaving? Maybe, but the world has change, and will not stop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold">if we go on avoiding riding the raging bull, what could be our future?</p>
<p>Learning how to work, talk, and live better together will be the hardest and long time challenge we will face.<br />
I mean, we will for sure not become a kind of &#8220;aseptic &amp; polite model&#8221;, just how to avoid to kick too quickly the reply button and comment&#8217;s field.<br />
<br />
Trying to understand what kind of people we&#8217;re interactive with, and make our best so they could feel good.</p>
<h3>So what is already a work in progress : </h3>
<ul>
<li> &#8211; 12.3 release : make noise, spread the word, show time !</li>
<li> &#8211; board transparency : yeap, we should know more &amp; more what work is done, who, what, when. (not the details especially for privacy) </li>
<li> &#8211; board tasks : concrete proposals from SUSE will need actions from our side to endorse the power and responsibility of doing.</li>
<li> &#8211; conference lead by community : osc13 in Thessaloniki, before being the ever cool&#8217;est place where to be in July need attention and effort from all of us. (Subscribing the opensuse-conference mailing list is a way to learn about progress, and stand-up for helping)</li>
<li> &#8211; community in charge</li>
</ul>
<h2>One word to conclude</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you feel as an open source developer, user, or enthusiast if you see this beautiful piece of software is used by hundred of schools and thousand of students? Great isn&#8217;t it? And that&#8217;s what happened here in a small dot on this earth in <a title="Yogyakarta Special Region" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta_%28special_region%29" target="_blank">Yogyakarta Indonesia</a>.</p>
<p>This program was initiated by the Government of Indonesia with the objective to introduce the open source and e-learning method to student and teacher. So three years ago I was contacted to help them to realize their dream, and here I&#8217;m now reporting that there are around 7300 openSUSE installation in <a title="openSUSE in schools" href="http://ict-eqep.com/locations/map_350.html" target="_blank">350 elementary and junior-high schools</a>. We also use SLES in servers to provide repositories and e-learning materials in SCORM using Moodle.  This is work in progress. We educate teachers to use openSUSE and also creating learning material so it is always in beta stage I think <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I want to say thank you to all the good people, my friends and co-workers, they are unknown in openSUSE community, even many of them are not subscribing the mailing list, but they are the true openSUSE ambassadors in Indonesia. They come to schools and persuade the teachers to use openSUSE. Without them this dream will never come true. Picture below show some of them smiling holding the openSUSE 12.1 promo DVD that AJ sent to me. You all great! Also picture of teachers while following our session about openSUSE.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally we welcome everyone in openSUSE community if you want to visit Indonesia don&#8217;t forget to pay a visit to one of this schools in Yogyakarta and you will see how student are happy using it <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<h3>Imagine it!</h3>
<p>A few months ago, I&#8217;ve started to look for my next car. Then a crazy idea emerged, why not a Geeko&#8217;s car?
</p>
<h3>Find it!</h3>
<p>At that time Gilbert my mechanic <a href="http://www.garagedelavenir.ch" title="Garage de l'avenir">[www]</a> told me that Ford will get a new Fiesta model called Sport+ with a more powerful engine, a new look &amp; feel. I went to the exhibition and made a short test drive. The car was cool. The exhibit model was in blue with 2 white stripes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;clear:both:font-size:small"><span style="color:navy">Blue?</span> <span style="color:green">Green</span> would have been cool isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><span id="more-8048"></span><br />
<div id="attachment_8047" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1149.jpg"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1149-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-8047" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fiesta Sport+ with original stripes</p></div><br />
<h3>Draw it!</h3>
<p>Several weeks have past (Gnome3 launch, DesktopSummit, OSC11 preparation), but the idea stayed in my mind. Good news, the model exist in white with blue stripes too.
<p>After finding a collada model compatible with Blender and pattern for printers coming from ccvision.de (Ford_231 for reference) I started imagine how I can transform it. Playing with demo pictures gimp, blender and inkscape, my project started to look as I wanted : <span style="color:green">green it will be!</span></p>
<h3>Order it!</h3>
<p>
End of August the things became more serious, the old one was on good shape, the price and primes for the new one were all interesting and inside my budget, let&#8217;s order it!<br />
Unfortunately, the delay to get the car and the design done before OSC11 was too short. At least let&#8217;s get the car nude white.</p>
<p>
No need to say that we enjoyed the journey to Nuremberg with the new car.  Okay back home I let the car for two days with the instructions to print it.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold">Gosh the result totally blew my mind!</h3>

<p>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, months after the first virtual party [1][2][3] organized for 11.4 launch, </p>
<p>Françoise (aka Morgane Marquis) and myself (tigerfoot) organize 3 new parties on SecondLife [4] to welcome and fest our next release openSUSE 12.1, coming around the 11.11.11. </p>
<ul style="font-weight:bold">
<li>Three virtual great Saturday: October 22th, November 12th and December 10th.</li>
<li>From 6 to 8am Australian DJ Ariella is back again.</li>
<li>From 9 to 11am (SL time : utc-9) we will have the pleasure to listen American DJ Esquivel.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should take this opportunity to try Second Life, creating an avatar, coming to dance and drinking some beers with us at Geekos Place.<br />

<h2>What&#8217;s new ?</h2>
<p>From January to march 2011, we did rent a land, which cost much less than in real life, but had a cost. Yes it&#8217;s money and time to organize party, to find good DJ, invite people and for the main point : to get people come to your place. So after 10 great evenings with around 30-40 people, we decided to slow down. In April, we discovered the <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">linux tribe sim</span>. The place has been created to promote opensource, and even started recently a learning place (blender, gimp &#8230;).</p>
<p>Finally our Geekos Place is much smaller, but has found a place in the middle of the penguins tribe.<br />
Thanks to them.

<h2>Second Life (SL) in a few words</h2>
<p>Second Life represent millions of avatars (names and password), but let&#8217;s say about 40 to 60&#8217;000 people are connected at the same time (from USA to Europe, Australia, Africa &#8230;). As most of these visitors have a programmer or design profile, they can&#8217;t stand themselves from buying a land, creating a place, testing new concepts or scripts. So in fact, SL is a huge great creative space &#8230; and seems sometimes like a desert (as less people stand together on a same place).</p>
<h3>Why Second Life ?</h3>
<p>In January, we start looking for open groups on SL &#8230; and we were surprised to see a list of hundred of those. Then we discovered that if some were listing the different Linux distributions, most of them forgot openSUSE. Worst when we arrived on the penguin tribe sim, it seems we fall inside an Ubuntu fan club. We heard that openSUSE was too difficult to install! Beg your pardon ? lol. <br />
Ok, we won&#8217;t go to SL for a competition (in term of fight), but just to be where users and contributors can be!
</p>
<p>Even if SL is not that easy to use, as it need a powerful openGL 3D stack, and specialized client software [5], it&#8217;s a surprising place to visit</p>
<h2>Real and virtual life</h2>

<a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/esqu.jpg"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/esqu-150x150.jpg" alt="Virtual Party DJ Esquievel" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8021" /></a></p>
<p>We could start a big talk on &quot;what is real or not?&quot; But who cares?</p>
<p>We just invite you to come, try it, Have a lot of fun, and represent openSUSE on a virtual place.</p>
<p>We found 2 great DJ, Ariella from Australia, and Esquievel from the USA. Both are mixing great rock and pleasant music. And we have to remember that they are not paid, except with the tips they receive during the party from you and us. If you are not an addict of SL perhaps you don&#8217;t know that pretty cheap to give generous tips on SL. And each buck earn is really appreciate by the DJ. Think about it!</p>

<h2>Act Now!</h2>
<p style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center">Can we count on your energy and joy?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t wait the last minute! Create today your avatar, and come as soon as possible, get and wear your free Geeko t-shirt! If you need help to move or to find the place, just <acronym title="Instant message">IM</acronym> Morgane Marquis or Tigerfoot. See or hear you soon.</p>
