				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since April I am  <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2019/04/03/experimental-opensuse-mirror-via-ipfs/">using IPFS</a></p>
<p>Now I wanted to document some neat tricks and details.</p>
<p>When you have the hex-encoded sha256sum of a small file &#8211; for this example let&#8217;s use the GPLv3.txt on our media &#8211;<br />
<code>sha256sum /ipns/opensuse.zq1.de/tumbleweed/repo/oss/GPLv3.txt<br />
8ceb4b9ee5adedde47b31e975c1d90c73ad27b6b165a1dcd80c7c545eb65b90</code></p>
<p>Then you can use the hash to address content directly by prefixing it with /ipfs/f01551220 so it becomes</p>
<p>/ipfs/f015512208ceb4b9ee5adedde47b31e975c1d90c73ad27b6b165a1dcd80c7c545eb65b903</p>
<p>In theory this also works with SHA1 and the /ipfs/f01551114 prefix, but then you risk experiencing non-unique content like<br />
/ipfs/f0155111438762cf7f55934b34d179ae6a4c80cadccbb7f0a</p>
<p>And dont even think about using MD5.</p>
<p>For this trick to work, the file needs to be added with <code>ipfs add --raw-leaves</code> and it must be a single chunk &#8211; by default 256kB or smaller, but if you do the adding, you can also use larger chunks.</p>
<p>Here is a decoding of the different parts of the prefix:<br />
/ipfs/ is the common path for IPFS-addressed content<br />
f is the <a href="https://github.com/multiformats/multibase">multibase prefix</a> for hex-encoded data<br />
01 is for the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/cid/#version-1">CID version 1</a><br />
55 is for <a href="https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv#L34">raw binary</a><br />
12 is for <a href="https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv#L6">sha2-256</a> (the default hash in IPFS)<br />
20 is for 32 byte = 256 bit length of hash</p>
<p>And finally, you can also access this content via the various IPFS-web-gateways:<br />
<a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/f015512208ceb4b9ee5adedde47b31e975c1d90c73ad27b6b165a1dcd80c7c545eb65b903">https://ipfs.io/ipfs/f015512208ceb4b9ee5adedde47b31e975c1d90c73ad27b6b165a1dcd80c7c545eb65b903</a></p>
<p>You can also do the same trick with other multibase encodings of the same data &#8211; e.g. <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/010101010100010010001000001000110011101011010010111001111011100101101011011110110111011110010001111011001100011110100101110101110000011101100100001100011100111010110100100111101101101011000101100101101000011101110011011000000011000111110001010100010111101011011001011011100100000011">base2</a></p>
<p>Base2 looks pretty geeky, but so far I have not found practical applications.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As (open)SUSE releases are approaching, the YaST team is basically in bug squashing mode. However, we are still adding some missing bits, like the bcache support for AutoYaST. Additionally, there are some interesting improvements we would like to let you know about:</p>
<ul>
<li>AutoYaST support for using Btrfs subvolumes as user <em>home</em> directories.</li>
<li>Improved Certificates management in the registration module.</li>
<li>Correct detection of DASDs when using virtio-blk.</li>
<li>Proper handling of the <code>resume</code> option in the bootloader module.</li>
<li>Display fonts and icons properly during installation.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, as a bonus, some insights about a YaST font scaling problem on the GNOME desktop (spoiler: not a YaST bug at all).</p>
<h3 id="adding-bcache-support-to-autoyast">Adding bcache support to AutoYaST</h3>
<p>A few days ago, support for bcache landed in the <em>YaST Partitioner</em>. In a nutshell, bcache is a caching system that allows to improve the performance of any big but slow disk (so-called <em>backing device</em>) by using a faster and smaller disk (<em>caching device</em>).</p>
<p>The way to describe a bcache in AutoYaST is pretty similar to how a RAID or a LVM Volume Group is described. On one hand, you need to specify which devices are going to be used as <em>backing</em> and <em>caching</em> devices by setting <code>bcache_backing_for</code> and <code>bcache_caching_for</code> elements. And, on the other hand, you need to describe the layout of the bcache device itself. As you would do for a RAID, you can partition the device or use it as a filesystem.</p>
<p>The example below creates a bcache device (called <code>/dev/bcache0</code>) using <code>/dev/sda</code> to speed up the access to <code>/dev/sdb</code>.</p>
<pre>
&lt;partitioning config:type="list"&gt;
    &lt;drive&gt;
      &lt;type config:type="symbol"&gt;CT_DISK&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;device&gt;/dev/sda&lt;/device&gt;
      &lt;disklabel&gt;msdos&lt;/disklabel&gt;
      &lt;use&gt;all&lt;/use&gt;
      &lt;partitions config:type="list"&gt;
        &lt;partition&gt;
          &lt;!-- It can serve as caching device for several bcaches --&gt;
          &lt;bcache_caching_for config:type="list"&gt;
            &lt;listentry&gt;/dev/bcache0&lt;/listentry&gt;
          &lt;/bcache_caching_for&gt;
          &lt;size&gt;max&lt;/size&gt;
        &lt;/partition&gt;
      &lt;/partitions&gt;
    &lt;/drive&gt;

    &lt;drive&gt;
      &lt;type config:type="symbol"&gt;CT_DISK&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;device&gt;/dev/sdb&lt;/device&gt;
      &lt;use&gt;all&lt;/use&gt;
      &lt;!-- &lt;disklabel&gt;none&lt;/disklabel&gt; --&gt;
      &lt;disklabel&gt;msdos&lt;/disklabel&gt;
      &lt;partitions config:type="list"&gt;
        &lt;partition&gt;
          &lt;!-- It can serve as backing device just for one bcache --&gt;
          &lt;bcache_backing_for&gt;/dev/bcache0&lt;/bcache_backing_for&gt;
        &lt;/partition&gt;
      &lt;/partitions&gt;
    &lt;/drive&gt;

    &lt;drive&gt;
      &lt;type config:type="symbol"&gt;CT_BCACHE&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;device&gt;/dev/bcache0&lt;/device&gt;
      &lt;bcache_options&gt;
        &lt;cache_mode&gt;writethrough&lt;/cache_mode&gt;
      &lt;/bcache_options&gt;
      &lt;use&gt;all&lt;/use&gt;
      &lt;partitions config:type="list"&gt;
        &lt;partition&gt;
          &lt;mount&gt;/data&lt;/mount&gt;
          &lt;size&gt;20GiB&lt;/size&gt;
        &lt;/partition&gt;
        &lt;partition&gt;
          &lt;mount&gt;swap&lt;/mount&gt;
          &lt;filesystem config:type="symbol"&gt;swap&lt;/filesystem&gt;
          &lt;size&gt;1GiB&lt;/size&gt;
        &lt;/partition&gt;
      &lt;/partitions&gt;
    &lt;/drive&gt;
  &lt;/partitioning&gt;
</pre>
<h3>Using Btrfs Subvolumes as User Home Directories in AutoYaST</h2>
<p>In our last report we presented a <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2019/02/27/yast-sprint-71-72/create-user-home-btrfs-subvolume">new feature</a> to allow using Btrfs subvolumes as user&#8217;s home directories. However, the AutoYaST support for that feature was simply missing.</p>
<p>Now you can use the <code>home_btrfs_subvolume</code> to control whether a Btrfs should be used as home directory.</p>
<pre>
&lt;user&gt;
   &lt;encrypted config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/encrypted&gt;
   &lt;home_btrfs_subvolume config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/home_btrfs_subvolume&gt;
   &lt;fullname&gt;test user&lt;/fullname&gt;
   &lt;gid&gt;100&lt;/gid&gt;
   &lt;home&gt;/home/test&lt;/home&gt;
   &lt;shell&gt;/bin/bash&lt;/shell&gt;
   &lt;uid&gt;1003&lt;/uid&gt;
   &lt;user_password&gt;test&lt;/user_password&gt;
   &lt;username&gt;test&lt;/username&gt;
&lt;/user&gt;
</pre>
<h3 id="tuning-the-bootloaders-resume-parameter">Tuning the Bootloader’s <code>resume</code> parameter</h3>
<p>The <code>resume</code> parameter is used by the bootloader to tell the kernel which swap partition should be used for the <em>suspend to disk</em> feature. If you are curious enough, you can find the value for your system in the <em>Kernel Parameters</em> tab of the <em>YaST bootloader module</em>. Now that we know what the <code>resume</code> parameter is, it is time to talk about the two issues we have solved recently.</p>
<p>The first problem was related to the way in which YaST determines which swap partition should be used. The bug report mentioned that YaST was taking a swap partition not used by the system that, in addition, was located in a removable device. After checking the code, we found out that we were using a simplistic heuristic which just selected the biggest swap partition available. We improve that logic to use the biggest swap partition <em>which is being used by the system</em>. However, if no suitable partition is found, YaST will fall back to the old behaviour.</p>
<p>The second problem was related to AutoYaST not handling the <code>noresume</code> option properly. When a user specified that option, AutoYaST just blindly added it to the kernel command line keeping the conflicting <code>resume</code> parameter too. Of course, that caused troubles. Now when <code>noresume</code> is given, AutoYaST simply removes all occurrences of the <code>resume</code> parameter.</p>
<h3 id="registration-openssl-and-debugging">Registration, OpenSSL and Debugging</h3>
<p>These days, handling the SSL certificates in a proper way is key to keep our systems secured. So during this sprint, we invested quite some time improving how certificates are used in our registration module. Basically, we have improved YaST behaviour in these scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using self-signed certificates.</li>
<li>Handling with unknown certificate authorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the custom registration server (the new <a href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/book_rmt/data/book_rmt.html">RMT</a> or the older <a href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_smt/data/book_smt.html">SMT</a>) use a self-signed certificate, YaST offers to import the server certificate and make it known to the system.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yast-registration-self-signed-certificate.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yast-registration-self-signed-certificate-300x225.png" alt="Self-signed Certificate Dialog" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13694" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yast-registration-self-signed-certificate-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yast-registration-self-signed-certificate-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yast-registration-self-signed-certificate.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, when the server SSL key was signed by an unknown key, YaST used to just display an error popup. That was not much helpful as it was not obvious what to do. Now a new popup which contains some hints about how to import the CA certificate manually is displayed. In this case it cannot be imported automatically as YaST does not know where to obtain it, it is not present in the server response.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yast-registration-unknown-certificate-authority.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yast-registration-unknown-certificate-authority-300x225.png" alt="Unknown Certificate Authority Dialog" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13695" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yast-registration-unknown-certificate-authority-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yast-registration-unknown-certificate-authority-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/yast-registration-unknown-certificate-authority.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The work of importing and activating the certificate is now performed by a YaST script, preventing the user from having to run some complicated (and error prone) commands manually.</p>
<p>These improvement and some other OpenSSL details have been documented in the <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-registration/wiki/OpenSSL-Certificates">OpenSSL Certificates</a> documentation. Additionally, if you ever need to debug some SSL related issue, this new <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-registration/wiki/OpenSSL-Debugging-Hints">OpenSSL Debugging Hints</a> documentation might be useful for you. It covers basic topics, like displaying PEM certificate details, running a testing HTTPS server, creating a self-signed certificate, etc.</p>
<h3 id="detecting-dasds-when-using-virtio-blk-in-zkvm">Detecting DASDs when using virtio-blk in zKVM</h3>
<p>IBM&#8217;s S/390 platform has some special features that you will not find in conventional architectures like x86. One of them are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-access_storage_device">DASD</a> hard disks. These devices can be accessed in zKVM using the virtio-blk backend, but DASDs need special handling. For instance, the most common DASD type (CDL ECKD) cannot be used with an MS-DOS partition table nor a GPT, instead a DASD partition table is required. Having this requirement in mind, YaST now detects DASDs using virtio-blk properly and uses the correct DASD partition table.</p>
<h3 id="improving-fonts-and-icons-handling-in-the-installer">Improving Fonts and Icons Handling in the Installer</h3>
<p>Back some time ago, <a href="https://github.com/hellcp">Stasiek Michalski</a> (a.k.a. as <em>hellcp</em>), one of our very active openSUSE community contributors, spent quite some work for better artwork in YaST. As a result, icons are now used from the desktop’s icon theme whenever possible, and the installer font was changed.</p>
<p>One fallout of the latter was that the font size was now too small for users with diminishing eyesight: That new font has different font metrics, so the default font size was too small. We fixed that during this sprint. See also <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/branding/pulls/107">openSUSE/branding#107</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, the disappearing icons issue was solved too. See <a href="https://github.com/libyui/libyui-qt/pull/100">libyui/libyui-qt#100</a> if you are interested in the details.</p>
<p>And just to get this straight: We are welcoming active community members to contribute (thanks again, @hellcp!). There will be some bugs; that’s just natural. We need to cooperate to fix them.</p>
<h3 id="yast-font-scaling-problem-on-the-gnome-desktop">YaST Font Scaling Problem on the GNOME Desktop</h3>
<p>This is not really a YaST problem, but of course it was still the natural thing to write a bug report against YaST for this <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1123424">bsc#1123424</a>. And it took us quite a while to figure out what went wrong here.</p>
<p>Basically, when you use the <em>GNOME Tweak Tool</em> to set a <em>Font Scaling Factor</em> that is not a multiple of 0.25, this is completely ignored, and so all Qt5 applications (including the YaST Qt Control Center and all YaST modules) appear with unscaled fonts.</p>
<p>The problem is this <em>GNOME Tweak Tool</em> setting non-integer DPI values (which is already out of spec and thus a bug) and the Qt5 libraries consequently completely ignoring that DPI value. So that GNOME tool should do it correctly, but the Qt5 libs could also handle this more gracefully.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is nothing that we can do about this from the YaST side, even though we are aware that this might become reported as a YaST bug again in the future <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>Closing Thoughs</h3>
<p>As we stated at the beginning of this post, we are basically in bug squashing mode. So, please, if you have some time, give the testing versions of (open)SUSE a try and report as many bugs as you can.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I see the official documentation has full tutorial for <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/10/admin_manual/installation/php_54_installation.html" target="1">RHEL 6 or CentOS 6</a> and <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/10/admin_manual/installation/php_55_installation.html" target="1">RHEL 7 or CentOS 7</a>. The main documentation covers <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/10/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html" target="1">Ubuntu 14.04 LTS</a></p>
<p>openSUSE already has the <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=nextcloud&amp;search_devel=false&amp;search_unsupported=false&amp;baseproject=openSUSE%3AFactory" target="1">Nextcloud client packaged in Tumbelweed and the Server is in the PHP extra repo!</a> Personally, I prefer to install eveything from official repository, so when an update is available, I can have it without a glitch. This tutorial describes how to install Nextcloud using command line. I followed the official documentation of <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/10/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html" target="1">Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installation</a>.</p>
<p>Why choose <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Leap" target="1">openSUSE Leap</a>? openSUSE Leap is a brand new way of building openSUSE and is new type of hybrid Linux distribution. Leap uses source from <a href="https://www.suse.com/promo/sle/" target="1">SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE)</a>, which gives Leap a level of stability unmatched by other Linux distributions, and combines that with community developments to give users, developers and sysadmins the best stable Linux experience available. Contributor and enterprise efforts for Leap bridge a gap between matured packages and newer packages found in openSUSE’s other distribution Tumbleweed. You can download openSUSE Leap from the site <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/" target="1">https://software.opensuse.org/</a>.<br />
<span id="more-12089"></span><br />
Make sure that ssh (sshd) is enabled and also the firewall either is disabled or <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SuSEfirewall2" target="1">make an exception to the apache and ssh services</a>. You can also set a static IP (<a href="http://eiosifidis.blogspot.gr/2015/05/set-static-ip-on-your-opensuse-raspberry-pi.html" target="1">check out how</a>).</p>
<p>First of all, let&#8217;s install the required and recommended modules for a typical Nextcloud installation, using Apache and MariaDB, by issuing the following commands in a terminal:</p>
<div class="code"><strong>zypper in apache2 mariadb apache2-mod_php5 php5-gd php5-json php5-fpm php5-mysql php5-curl php5-intl php5-mcrypt php5-zip php5-mbstring php5-zlib</strong></div>
<p><b>Create Database (optional since it&#8217;ll create eveything automatically)</b><br />
Next step, create a database. First of all start the service.</p>
<div class="code"><strong>systemctl start mysql.service<br />
systemctl enable mysql.service</strong></div>
<p>The root password is empty by default. That means that you can press enter and you can use your root user. That&#8217;s not safe at all. So you can set a password using the command:</p>
<div class="code"><strong>mysqladmin -u root password newpass</strong></div>
<p>Where newpass is the password you want.</p>
<p>Now you set the root password, create the database.</p>
<blockquote><p>mysql -u root -p<br />
#you&#8217;ll be asked for your root passwordCREATE DATABASE nextcloudb;</p>
<p>GRANT ALL ON nextcloudb.* TO ncuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY &#8216;dbpass&#8217;;</p></blockquote>
<p>Database user: <b>ncuser</b><br />
Database name: <b>nextcloudb</b><br />
Database user password: <b>dbpass</b></p>
<p>You can change the above information accordingly.</p>
<p><b>PHP changes</b><br />
Now you should edit the php.ini file.</p>
<blockquote><p>nano /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini</p></blockquote>
<p>change the values</p>
<blockquote><p>post_max_size = 50G<br />
upload_max_filesize = 25G<br />
max_file_uploads = 200<br />
max_input_time = 3600<br />
max_execution_time = 3600<br />
session.gc_maxlifetime = 3600<br />
memory_limit = 512M</p></blockquote>
<p>and finally enable the extensions.</p>
<blockquote><p>extension=php_gd2.dll<br />
extension=php_mbstring.dll</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Apache Configuration</b><br />
You should enable some modules. Some might be already enabled.</p>
<blockquote><p>a2enmod php5<br />
a2enmod rewrite<br />
a2enmod headers<br />
a2enmod env<br />
a2enmod dir<br />
a2enmod mime</p></blockquote>
<p>Now start the apache service.</p>
<blockquote><p>systemctl start apache2.service<br />
systemctl enable apache2.service</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Install Nextcloud from source code (option 1, preferable)</b><br />
Before the installation, create the data folder and give the right permissions (preferably outside the server directory for security reasons). I created a directory in the <i>/mnt</i> directory. You can mount a USB disk, add it to fstab and save your data there. The commands are:</p>
<blockquote><p>mkdir /mnt/nextcloud_data<br />
chmod -R 0770 /mnt/nextcloud_data<br />
chown wwwrun /mnt/nextcloud_data</p></blockquote>
<p>Now download Nextcloud (find the latest version at <a href="https://nextcloud.com/install/" target="1">https://nextcloud.com/install/</a>). Then unzip and move the folder to the server directory.</p>
<blockquote><p>wget https://download.nextcloud.com/server/releases/nextcloud-10.0.0.zip<br />
unzip nextcloud-10.0.0.zip<br />
cp -r nextcloud /srv/www/htdocs<br />
chown -R wwwrun /srv/www/htdocs/nextcloud/</p></blockquote>
<p>Make sure that everything is OK and then delete the folder nextcloud and nextcloud-10.0.0.zip from the root (user) directory.</p>
<p>Now open your browser to the server IP/nextcloud</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/45s9l5te6ektb5s/nextcloud_install.png?raw=1" target="1"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/45s9l5te6ektb5s/nextcloud_install.png?raw=1" width="80%" height="80%" /></a>Set your administrator username and password.<br />
Your data directory is: /mnt/nextcloud_data<br />
Regarding database, use the following.<br />
Database user: <b>ncuser</b><br />
Database name: <b>nextcloudb</b><br />
Database user password: <b>dbpass</b></p>
<p>Wait until it ends the installation. The page you&#8217;ll see is the following.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/e0mbm5tdktilmsp/nextcloud_first_login.png?raw=1" target="1"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/e0mbm5tdktilmsp/nextcloud_first_login.png?raw=1" width="80%" height="80%" /></a></p>
<p><b>Install Nextcloud using the respository (option 2)</b></p>
<p>If you want to have automatic updates of your Nextcloud instance when there&#8217;s a new version, you can add the repository. There are packages available for openSUSE Leap 42.1, 42.2 and Tumbleweed (we recommend openSUSE Leap 42.1). You should be an administrator, so you can install Nextloud on your server.</p>
<p>1. Add the Nextcloud repository.<br />
<strong>openSUSE_Leap_42.2</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/php:/applications/openSUSE_Leap_42.2/ Nextcloud</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>openSUSE_Leap_42.1</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/php:/applications/openSUSE_Leap_42.1/ Nextcloud</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>openSUSE_Leap_Tumbleweed</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/php:/applications/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/ Nextcloud</p></blockquote>
<p>2. Refresh your repositories</p>
<blockquote><p>zypper refresh</p></blockquote>
<p>3. Install Nextcloud (be careful you have to install LAMP first and change permissions of the files).</p>
<blockquote><p>zypper install nextcloud</p></blockquote>
<p>4. Open http://serverIP/nextcloud to install your instance (admin user account). Be careful to create another folder with the proper permissions for your data (as described).</p>
<p>5. Login and use Nextloud.</p>
<p>For more information about Nextcloud on openSUSE, check <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Nextcloud" target="_blank">openSUSE wiki</a>.</p>
<p>For any changes, check the <a href="https://github.com/iosifidis/nextcloud-opensuse-leap" target="1">github page</a>.</p>
<p>For more configuration, you can follow the <a href="https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/10/admin_manual/contents.html" target="1">official documentation</a>. That was the basic installation on openSUSE Leap.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently we implemented <a href="http://www.tallysolutions.com/products/tallyerp9/">Tally ERP 9</a> solution for <a href="http://anticopumps.co.in/">Antico Pumps</a>. That itself is not interesting, the interesting part is they are using <a href="http://ltsp.org/">LTSP</a> Fat client system on <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</a>. They have only one server from which all their client computers boot over the network, the clients do not have hard disk, client OS with all softwares they need including wine(Tally is Windows only software), as well as users&#8217; data resides on the server. Once the client boots all the local resources are used so single low power server can be used to serve many clients.</p>
<p>Tally multiuser is served from a Samba share  on a NAS device, Tally folder is copied to samba share and path to Tally Data is changed so that it points there. Everything they need including printing and export(CSV) works from all clients. Same way Tally can be run on standalone computers. Neither Tally, Wine or openSUSE are modified for getting it working as it would under Windows environment.</p>

This effectively makes it the only enterprise grade long term supported(LTS) distribution for Education.</p>
<p>As with previous releases <a href="http://download.opensuse-education.org/~cyberorg/opensuse-edu-life-4211-packages.txt">we have bundled a ton of softwares</a> on this <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick">live DVD/USB</a> specially packaged for education, along with the Plasma, GNOME and Mate Desktop Environments, full multimedia experience is also provided out of the box thanks to the Packman repositories. Only x86_64 architecture is supported, if you have a lot of machines that only support x86 then read on to find out how you can extend their Li-f-e.<br />
<span id="more-11596"></span></p>
<p>You can of course very <a href="http://cyberorg.github.io/kiwi-ltsp-howto/">easily turn Li-f-e to full-fledged LTSP server</a> to PXE boot machines in your local network. Booting both i686 and x86_64 architectures is supported. In case you need to PXE boot machines below i686 then you would have to <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/kiwi-ltsp-tinycore-tc">install this package</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_%28software%29#IRC" target="_blank">IRC Bouncers</a> . My favourite one is ZNC. ZNC installation on server is a simple thing (<strong>zypper in znc</strong>). But what if you don&#8217;t have a server (avoid all the costs)? The best solution is a Raspberry Pi (it doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s B, B+, 2). It&#8217;s small, no power consumption, can easily setup as home small server. The only thing that it might disturb you, is the lights.</p>
<p>First of all, check out how you can install openSUSE on <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/HCL:Raspberry_Pi" target="1">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>
<p>Now, you have to compile ZNC. There&#8217;s no package in the repositories. If developers read this, please please make an ARM package. Please!!!</p>
<p>First of all, you have to install the following packages (that&#8217;s what I did):</p>
<blockquote><p>zypper in gcc-c++ gcc git libopenssl-devel make</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s download the <a href="http://znc.in/releases/" target="_blank">last release</a> (you can find the whole procedure at <a href="http://wiki.znc.in/Installation#Source_Tarball" target="_blank">official page</a>)</p>
<blockquote><p>wget http://znc.in/releases/znc-latest.tar.gz</p></blockquote>
<p>Then untar the file:</p>
<blockquote><p>tar -xzvf znc*.*gz</p></blockquote>
<p>Then you have to do some steps that usually do when you compile:</p>
<blockquote><p>cd znc*</p></blockquote>
<p>and run the command</p>
<blockquote><p>./configure</p></blockquote>
<p>Next command will take a lot of time to finish</p>
<blockquote><p>make</p></blockquote>
<p>When it&#8217;s over, run the final command:</p>
<blockquote><p>make install</p></blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;re ready to use it. Now <em>login as user</em> and run the command:</p>
<blockquote><p>znc &#8211;makeconf</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have an older configuration, you can use it (run only the command <strong>znc</strong>).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is a credit-card sized computer running ARM processor that plugs into your TV/PC monitor, mouse and a keyboard, it is capable of running Linux and can be made to do many interesting things.The <a href="http://www.bananapi.org/">Banana Pi </a>is a what Chinese ingeniousness came up with after they checked out Raspberry Pi, they made a lot more powerful knockoff. This is a &#8220;How-to&#8221; use Banana Pi as <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI-LTSP">LTSP</a> client. <span id="more-11121"></span></p>
<p>There is <a href="http://www.berryterminal.com/">BerryTerminal</a> project which makes it possible to use Raspberry Pi as <a href="http://ltsp.org">LTSP</a> Thin Client, on the server you can run any distribution that can run LTSP server, it can be running CPU with x86/x86_64/whatever architecture as LTSP provides a way to run X session from the server via SSH tunnel. Biggest benefit of running LTSP is centralized user and data management, and clients can be of modest specification as all clients&#8217; sessions are run on the server. This is a drawback as well, as the server needs to be powerful enough to handle many sessions. This is where LTSP Fat Client help, it allows running of users&#8217; session on the client that are powerful enough, while users and data are stored on the central server allowing modest server to serve many more clients than it would otherwise. Raspberry Pi is not that capable to run full featured Linux desktop, Banana Pi with it&#8217;s dual core CPU and 1 GB RAM is just good enough to work as a Thin Client as well as a Fat Client. perfect for home, small office or school lab.</p>

<p>* Dump the openSUSE-Bananapi-LTSP.img on to a SD card, <a href="http://www.lemaker.org/resources/9-39/banana_pi_quick_start_guide.html">see step 5 here</a>.</p>
<p>* Change settings according to your network configuration</p>
<p>In the second partition of SD card etc/lts.conf edit the SERVER variable to point to LTSP server in your network.</p>
<p>* Plug the SD card in your Banana Pi and boot it up, make sure the network is connected and LTSP server is <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:LTSP_quick_start_12.2_Edu">set up properly</a>. You have to create users on the server to use for login on client.</p>
<p>*  In case you have a bigger SD card, use yast2 disk(partitioner) on the client to expand the second partition. You can use yast&#8217;s package manager to install more software. The default password for root is bananapi, you may want to change that first thing after booting.</p>
<p>If you would like to run LTSP client on <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Category:ARM_devices">ARM7 hardware supported by openSUSE</a> I would be happy to accept hardware donation to get it working <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Have a lot of fun&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Couple of days back went to a school here to demonstrate what openSUSE Education Li-f-e with <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI-LTSP">KIWI-LTSP</a> can bring to their lab. We have created a product based on <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">Li-f-e</a> called <a href="http://cyberorg.co.in/myscool/">My sCool Server</a>. It brings together all the goodies that a modern operating system must have and all the softwares required by the state board curriculum in one seamless package.<br />
<span id="more-10840"></span><br />
However my excitement evaporated quickly after knowing that their &#8220;well equipped&#8221;  computer lab was mostly made up of state of the art P4s!! kiwi-ltsp can work sort of OK with about 256M RAM, 512M is recommended. Once the user logs in, the processor and RAM on the client is not very important as all the processing happens on the server. This got me working on finding a way to bring the snappiness of this next generation OS running on i3 server performing exactly same on P4s with may be as little RAM as 128M.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://tinycorelinux.net/">Tiny Core Linux</a>, one awesome distribution in a very tiny bundle. So tiny in fact that the whole OS that PXE boots and gives full desktop X session via ssh or rdesktop is just 27M in size. Compare that to 26M size of just the initrd of standard openSUSE, 49M kiwi-ltsp&#8217;s initrd and 180M kiwi-ltsp&#8217;s system image. And incredibly it works very well on P4 PC with 128M RAM.</p>
<p>So if you have some old hardware <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2014/05/22/gnome-classic-edition-of-opensuse-education/">get some new Li-f-e</a>, <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:LTSP_quick_start_12.2_Edu">set up kiwi-ltsp</a> and <strong>after</strong> that install <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/kiwi-ltsp-tinycore-tc">kiwi-ltsp-tinycore-tc</a> package. Once the package is installed you would see tinycore-thinclient available in PXE boot menu.</p>
<p>Edit <strong><em>/srv/tftpboot/images/tc/nfsrw/home/tc/client.conf</em></strong> according to your need. Change RUN_COMMAND=mate-session on Li-f-e GNOME Classic edition, GNOME seems to have this annoying bug that locks the screen and does not allow unlocking if GDM was not used as display manager. You can remove/comment RSESSION=ssh line to use rdesktop. Use the <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/xrdp">xrdp</a> package from server:ltsp repository, and of course enable/start the service(chkconfig xrdp on &amp;&amp; rcxrdp start). Change the line in /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh that starts Xsession appending the session you want it to start by default for example: /etc/X11/xdm/Xsession mate-session, without that the DEFAULT_WM from /etc/sysconfig/windowmanager is used.</p>
<p>If you are not using openSUSE or cannot use rpm package, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/kiwi-ltsp/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/tinycore-thinclient/">get the files</a> from here, adapt the setup script to suite your need.</p>
