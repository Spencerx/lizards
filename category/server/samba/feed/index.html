<p>We have put together a nice set of tools for everyone including teachers, students, parents and IT administrators.  It covers quite a lot of territory: from chemistry, mathematics to astronomy and Geography. Whether you are into software development or just someone looking for Linux distribution that comes with everything working out of the box, your search ends here.</p>
<p>Edit: We now also have x86_64 version supporting UEFI boot <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e#Download">available for download</a>.</p>

<p><b>Education</b></p>
<p>Master chemistry with Avogadro and Kalzium periodic table. Avogadro is intended not only for molecular modeling research, but also for educational use. Check out <a href="http://avogadro.openmolecules.net/wiki/Education">their website</a> to find out how you can use it for education. Learn with flash cards, polish your word skills with Kanagram, Stardict dictionary or employ a typing tutor.</p>
<p>Want to create or become a Math genius? Get ahead with algebra, geometry or statistics.</p>
<p>For little ones, explore games and interactive pictographs to learn using Gcompris and Little Wizard.</p>
<p>If theology is your thing, there is Bibletime which can help you study the Bible, the Koran and other texts including fiction and non-fiction can be read on one of the many ebook readers included such as FBReader, Evince, Okular etc.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most useful deployment scenario for Linux in enterprise or educational environment is a fileserver with on access virus scanning, to serve Windows PCs on the network of course. Long ago there used to be samba-vscan that worked very nicely, it went missing in openSUSE 11.2 so dazuko kernel module worked in its place. On 11.3 dazuko is no longer available, enter dazukofs.</p>
<p><a href="http://dazuko.dnsalias.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"><span id="more-5202"></span>DazukoFS</a> is a stack-able filesystem for virus scanning, here is how it works:</p>
<p>Install<a href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=clamav&amp;baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.3&amp;lang=en&amp;exclude_debug=true"> clamav</a>, <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=clamav-db&amp;baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.3&amp;lang=en&amp;exclude_debug=true">clamav-db</a> and <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=dazukofs&amp;baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.3&amp;lang=en&amp;exclude_debug=true">dazukofs, dazukofs-kmp-yourkernelflavor</a> via 1-click.</p>
<p>Edit<em><strong> /etc/clamd.conf</strong></em> to change these parameters (change only these two parameters, nothing else there):</p>
<blockquote><p>User root<br />
ClamukoScanOnAccess yes</p></blockquote>
<p>Edit<em><strong> /etc/fstab</strong></em> to mount the folder/s you would like to scan on access. So if<em><strong> /home</strong></em> is on<em><strong> /dev/sda2</strong></em>, there will be another line for /home in fstab, this will effectively mount /home twice, one normal way and another as dazukofs.</p>
<blockquote><p>/home		     /home		  dazukofs   defaults		   0 0</p></blockquote>
<p>Run the following commands as root in terminal:</p>
<blockquote><p>insserv boot.dazukofs<br />
insserv clamd<br />
/etc/init.d/boot.dazukofs start<br />
mount -a<br />
rcclamd start<br />
freshclam</p></blockquote>
<p>Test it out with <a href="http://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com">eicar</a>, there will be message like this in<strong> /var/log/mail</strong><em> </em>if you try to copy eicar.com to user&#8217;s home<em>:<br />
</em></p>
<blockquote><p>clamd[4734]: Clamuko: /home/username/eicar.com: Eicar-Test-Signature FOUND</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to get the files with virus detected to quarantine, let me know if anyone knows how to do that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a follow-up to my previous post on <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/06/14/hackweek-v-local-caching-for-cifs-network-file-system/">Hackweek V: Local caching for CIFS network file system</a></p>
<p>Since the previous post, I worked on improving the patches that add local caching, fixed a few bugs, addressed review comments from the community and re-posted the patches. I also gave a talk about it at the SUSE Labs Conference 2010 took place at Prague. The slides can be found here: <a href="http://www.suse.com/~sjayaraman/talks/cifs-fsc-labsconf-2010.pdf">FS-Cache aware CIFS.</a></p>
<p>This patchset was merged in the upstream Linux kernel yesterday (Yay!) which means this feature would be available starting from kernel version 2.6.35-rc1.</p>
<p>The primary aim of caching data on the client side is to reduce the network calls to the CIFS Server whenever possible, thereby reducing the server load as well the network load. This will indirectly improve the performance and the scalability of the CIFS Server and will improve the number of clients per Server ratio. This feature could be useful in a number of scenarios:</p>
<p> &#8211; Render farms in Entertainment industry &#8211; used to distribute textures to individual rendering units<br />
 &#8211; Read only multimedia workloads<br />
 &#8211; Accelerate distributed web-servers<br />
 &#8211; Web server cluster nodes serve content from the cache<br />
 &#8211; /usr distributed by a network file system &#8211; to avoid spamming Servers when there is a power outage<br />
 &#8211; Caching Server with SSDs reexporting netfs data<br />
 &#8211; where a persistent cache remains across reboots is useful</p>
<p><em>However, be warned that local caching may not suitable for all workloads and a few workloads could suffer a slight performance hit (for e.g. read-once type workloads). So, you need to careful consider your workload/scenario before you start using local disk caching.<br />
</em><br />
When I reposted this patchset, I got asked whether I have done any benchmarking and could share the performance numbers. Here are the results from a 100Mb/s network:</p>
<p>Environment<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using my T60p laptop as the CIFS server (running Samba) and one of my test machines as CIFS client, connected over an ethernet of reported speed 1000 Mb/s. ethtool was used to throttle the speed to 100 Mb/s. The TCP bandwidth as seen by a pair of netcats between the client and the server is about 89.555 Mb/s.</p>
<p>Client has a 2.8 GHz Pentium D CPU with 2GB RAM<br />
Server has a 2.33GHz Core2 CPU (T7600) with 2GB RAM</p>
<p>Test<br />
&#8212;&#8211;<br />
The benchmark involves pulling a 200 MB file over CIFS to the client using cat to /dev/zero under `time&#8217;. The wall clock time reported was recorded.</p>
<p>First, the test was run on the server twice and the second result was recorded (noted as Server below i.e. time taken by the Server when file is loaded on the RAM).<br />
Secondly, the client was rebooted and the test was run with caching disabled (noted as None below).<br />
Next, the client was rebooted, the cache contents (if any) were erased with mkfs.ext3 and test was run again with cachefilesd running (noted as COLD)<br />
Next the client was rebooted, tests were run with caching enabled this time with a populated disk cache (noted as HOT).<br />
Finally, the test was run again without unmounting or rebooting to ensure pagecache remains valid (noted as PGCACHE).</p>
<p>The benchmark was repeated twice:</p>
<p>Cache (state) Run #1  Run#2<br />
=============  =======  =======<br />
Server         0.104 s  0.107 s<br />
<strong>None           26.042 s 26.576 s</strong><br />
COLD           26.703 s 26.787 s<br />
<strong>HOT            5.115 s  5.147 s</strong><br />
PGCACHE        0.091 s  0.092 s</p>
<p>As it can be seen when the disk cache is hot, the performance is roughly 5X times than reading over the network. And, it has to be noted that the Scalability improvement due to reduced network traffic cannot be seen as the test involves only a single client and the Server. The read performance with more number of clients would be more interesting as the cache can positively impact the scalability.</p>
