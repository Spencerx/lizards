				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best Linux distribution for education got a whole lot better, your <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">Li-f-e(Linux for Education)</a> takes a &#8220;<a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2015/11/04/opensuse-leap-42-1-becomes-first-hybrid-distribution/">Leap</a>&#8221; to 42.1. <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Education">openSUSE Education</a> community is proud to present this latest edition based on <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:42.1">openSUSE 42.1</a> with all the features, updates and bug fixes available on it till date. This effectively makes it the only enterprise grade long term supported(LTS) distribution for Education.</p>
<p>As with previous releases <a href="http://download.opensuse-education.org/~cyberorg/opensuse-edu-life-4211-packages.txt">we have bundled a ton of softwares</a> on this <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick">live DVD/USB</a> specially packaged for education, along with the Plasma, GNOME and Mate Desktop Environments, full multimedia experience is also provided out of the box thanks to the Packman repositories. Only x86_64 architecture is supported, if you have a lot of machines that only support x86 then read on to find out how you can extend their Li-f-e.<br />
<span id="more-11596"></span></p>
<p>You can of course very <a href="http://cyberorg.github.io/kiwi-ltsp-howto/">easily turn Li-f-e to full-fledged LTSP server</a> to PXE boot machines in your local network. Booting both i686 and x86_64 architectures is supported. In case you need to PXE boot machines below i686 then you would have to <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/kiwi-ltsp-tinycore-tc">install this package</a>.</p>
<p>Happy holidays!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has long been a challenge to use MS Silverlight based websites on linux systems.  Especially in The Netherlands this is a big hurdle as many (&gt;80%) of the secondary school websites that pupils must use to communicate with their school (for homework, marks, etc) are equipped with Silverlight.  Yes, really&#8230; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="&#x1f641;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Fortunately at the end of August 2013 I discovered <a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html#section_1_4" title="An incredible solution ">pipelight</a>, a very smart idea to use MS Silverlight based website natively on Linux.  The problem was however to find a working pipelight package for openSUSE.  As there was none, I decided to build one myself using the incredible <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/">openSUSE Build Service</a>.  It was quite a quest to obtain a working package, but due to very good cooperation with the pipelight developers, I&#8217;m now able to present a working pipelight package to the openSUSE community.  Oh, and while working on the package I reported a bug via the bug report system, that was solved and published via an rpm package within 1 hour after reporting it (that was during out of office hours).  Indeed within 1 hour after reporting the problem it was; accepted, investigated, analysed, fixed, tested, handed over to me, packaged, tested and published!  The amazing world of Open Source Software!</p>
<p>Pipelight works okay for the following sites (<a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html#section_5">among many others</a>): arte, LOVEFiLM, Netflix, Magister based NL schoolwebsites, WATCHEVER, etc.  View the complete list on the <a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html">pipelight website</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html#section_1_4">installation instructions</a> are on the pipelight website.  Be aware though, that pipelight requires the wine package that is provided via the home:rbos:pipelight repository.  With any other wine package, pipelight will (very likely) not work.  If you rely on your currently installed wine package and installed MS applications and are unsure that the wine package provided via the home:rbos:pipelight repository will leave your currently in use MS applications untouched: don&#8217;t install pipelight (or only after making very good backups).  You can always start by installing pipelight in a virtual machine.</p>
<p>Have fun with pipelight.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometime ago Gabriel asked me if I could give him help with the Banshee repositories for openSUSE; This repositories have many users hanging around and some packages are enabled on other projects, which makes them somehow sensible to deep changes.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;ve pushed to openSUSE:Factory Banshee 2.0.1 (latest stable release) and a few packages which live in the Banshee repository. I&#8217;ve also submitted a deletion request to ipod-sharp which is no longer maintained and was replaced in the past for libgpod.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve fixed the pending issues I&#8217;ve seen on the Banshee repository and Banshee 2.0.1 and disabled SLE 11 builds (not requiring all the dependencies). The repository serves now the following platforms (banshee and banshee-community-extensions):<br />
* SLE 11 SP1;<br />
* openSUSE 11.3;<br />
* openSUSE 11.4;<br />
* openSUSE Factory;<br />
* openSUSE Tumbleweed (new).</p>
<p>On Banshee:Unstable (which should hold the unstable releases, currently 2.1.0) I&#8217;ll be introducing some changes during the next days which will feature:<br />
* Package being renamed to &#8216;banshee&#8217;, thus dropping the current banshee-1;<br />
* Migration to pkgconfig() calls for &gt;= 1130;<br />
* Packages banshee and banshee-core get merged into banshee (currently banshee had only 4 documentation files);<br />
* Â New sub-package banshee-common to hold all the architecture independent files (ex: text files, icons, etc);<br />
* A few cleanups on the spec file for unsupported platforms (SLE11 and SLE11SP1 do not meet the requirements for this version and superior).</p>
<p>Once this is implemented and tested I will look into Banshee:Alpha and see the best way to start building daily/weekly snapshots using the OBS magic available and some magic tricks hidden in Dimstar&#8217;s sleeve which kindly accepted my request to give me a hand on such evil task.</p>
<p>In the future, on the next stable release (2.2.0), I&#8217;ll move the changes from Banshee:Unstable to Banshee and hopefully change the development repository to Banshee (as if Factory has the latest stable release it makes no sense in having Banshee&#8217;s development repository in Banshee:Unstable) and synch all at once.</p>
<p>Users subscribed to Banshee:Unstable repository might see some turbulence during the next days, while users subscribing now through the 1-Click installer will already be installing Banshee with the changesÂ describedÂ above.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With openSUSE 11.0 GNOME gained a new default BitTorrent client &#8211; <a title="Monsoon's home page" href="http://monsoon-project.org">monsoon</a>.Â  This choice has been met with some criticism, which is fine.</p>
<p>Well the <a title="openSUSE GNOME" href="http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME">GNOME Team</a> are holding their regular <a title="openSUSE GNOME meeting" href="http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME/Meetings">meeting</a> tomorrow Thursday 08 May 2008 @ 1600UTC/GMT/ZULU &#8211; or for those not quite with the whole &#8220;foreign&#8221; time thing try <a title="Meeting time in your local time" href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=08&amp;month=05&amp;year=2008&amp;hour=16&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=0">this</a>.Â  One of the themes is the BitTorrent client, why am I saying this?Â  Well for all those that have an opinion about it, please come along and let everyone know what that is, yes there may be a chance to get on your <a title="Description of a soap box" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soapbox">soap box</a> and denounce the world and it&#8217;s dog,Â  and we can have a real-time discussion about it.Â  If you don&#8217;t tell someone (preferably someone that makes decisions) then no one knows and nothing happens, filing bugs also helps <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>A bit of background reading on why the choice of monsoon was made can be found <a title="BT client review" href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:FunkyPenguin/TorrentReview">here</a> &#8211; yes I did indeed do the initial review of clients and made the recommendation, and I&#8217;m sticking to it!Â  I did however get others to test it to confirm I&#8217;m not 100% insane.Â  As with all applications your mileage may vary, but we are intent in trying to make your mileage be the same great journey as one would expect from openSUSE.Â  So if you care, join in and you never know you may bring something to the table that no one thought of <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
