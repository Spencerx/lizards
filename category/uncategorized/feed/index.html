				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I wrote in <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2013/12/16/continuing-opening-yast/" title="last blog post" target="_blank">the last blog post</a>, we try try to open YaST development as much as possible. When I thought what is the most annoying thing for me when contributing to an open source project, then it is when my contribution is ignored. So if I send a patch and do not get any response or I get response, but my patch is not merged without any reason, then I do not contribute again as I see it as a waste of time. To prevent such situation in YaST I&#8217;ve created an automatic reminder of pending pull requests for the <a href="http://github.com/yast" title="GitHub" target="_blank">YaST repos at GitHub</a>.<span id="more-10432"></span></p>
<p>How it is done? I want to have it transparent, reusable and automatic. The core component is a <a href="https://github.com/jreidinger/pull_requests_reminder" target="_blank">small ruby script</a> I wrote to fetch pending requests  for an organization on GitHub. It uses the GitHub API and tries to find any  pull request without activity for three working days.</p>
<p>This script is handled by our <a href="http://ci.opensuse.org/view/Yast" target="_blank">public Jenkins server</a> where it pulls the latest version of the script every working day and if there is any pending pull request it will send an <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/2014-01/msg00065.html" target="_blank">email with its result</a> to the YaST mailing list.</p>
<p>After a month of sending emails we have handled all longer running pull requests we have for YaST, so none of them have gone without activity longer than a month. I hope it encourages developers to create more pull requests as they will not be forgotten. We plan also to deploy such reminder for the <a href="http://github.com/libyui" title="libyui" target="_blank">libyui organization</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick note before openSUSE 13.1 hit the street.</p>
<p>Sebastian Siebert is trying to build and fix issues (essentially with 32bits) founded in the beta6 version of fglrx. Once that will be done, I should be able to deliver a new version of the fglrx drivers in the beta repository.</p>
<p>He also ask, like several of us AMD when they would like to release it: there&#8217;s no answer to that. So what does that mean.</p>
<p>The old 13.4 stable version from April, will NOT work with openSUSE 13.1. That&#8217;s why you will not find any driver in the stable repository.</p>
<p>For owners of old HD2xx-HD4xx, don&#8217;t dream, the legacy driver didn&#8217;t get update, so your choice is easy, use open source radeon driver. </p>
<p>I just hope I&#8217;m wrong in my feeling that we will have to wait until January, the launch of AMD new processor &amp; apu.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I went out and bought myself a spanking new multifunction creature from Samsung called a CLX3305FN. Generally, this fits into the CLX3300 series, but it has LAN only &#8211; no wifi (that would be the CLX3305FW). One of the reasons I decided I wanted this was because of the advertised &#8220;Scan to PC&#8221; function. I figured it would be simple on Windows and that I&#8217;d be able to get it working on Linux through YaST or sane/scanimage etc &#8211; i.e. a PITA but it would work.</p>
<p>As it turned out, it didn&#8217;t work at all. The function is supposed to be for Windows only. However, the clever lads over at bchemnet.com reverse engineered the protocol that was used between the scanner and a windows PC and managed to hack a script together which runs as a server daemon. It just sits there twiddling its thumbs until a user presses the &#8220;Scan to PC&#8221; button on the printer/scanner. Then it kicks into action and uses sane to send scan commands to the scanner. The result of it is that the scan lands in $HOME/Scans/ &#8211; thus, the Scan To PC function is neatly implemented for Linux. There are, of course, rough edges (such as the scanner sending in RAW rather than JPEG) but nothing that couldn&#8217;t be fixed in a hackweek.</p>
<p>So where can you get it? The package is available at http://software.opensuse.org/package/python-samsungScannerServer &#8211; but you&#8217;ll need to install the Samsung Unified Driver for Linux first. I found it at http://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/CLX-3305FN but apparently bchemnet.com has a repo for debian/ubuntu where you can download it too. Once you install that and my package, you&#8217;ll probably have to do a systemctl start samsungScannerServer (&#8220;probably&#8221; because I don&#8217;t really  know how systemd worked and schustered together a .service file based on google search results).</p>
<p>Another nice hackweek project would be to use something like inotify to discover incoming scanned files, gpg to encrypt them and email them to the user (and then delete the unencrypted version). I also need to look into getting the unified samsung driver working on ARM so I can use my raspberry as a scan server which sends encrypted scans to my email address&#8230;</p>

Sunny sky, rainy heart today.</p>
<p>Two days ago, I took the decision to not assist the certainly most fabulous openSUSE Conference next July in Thessaloniki.</p>
<p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<p>A conjunction of several factors lead to that decision.<br />
First what I regret was the chosen date. Damn July is the only expensive period to travel to Thessaloniki. The plane ticket never drop below the 800€ (hey! for sure I want to have Françoise with me), especially with the late announce of precise days. May, June, September would have been so cheaper&#8230;<br />
I can understand the choice main sponsor SUSE do, and their need to spread osc and SUSECON at a 6 month delay in the year&#8217;s schedule, but sadly does not work for me this year.<br />
<div id="attachment_9581" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thessaloniki-back-port.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thessaloniki-back-port-300x200.jpg" alt="Thessaloniki port" width="300" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-9581" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Thessaloniki port</p></div><br />
Secondly after February marketing hack-fest, I missed (I still don&#8217;t know how) the opportunity to get my travel reimbursed by the TSP and then loose half of the budget for osc. Before TSP get improved, and send a bounce email to ask you to send back your forms. So if you are sponsored for osc, fill and send back your expenses quickly after the event. Don&#8217;t believe you do it, check twice you really do it! Don&#8217;t suppose, be sure!</p>
<p>Another side, I already knew that a customer project will happen during that time-frame. As it concerns a lot of partner&#8217;s I&#8217;ve to take in account the availability of each of them. Unfortunately, after believing that it could be doable to free-up time for osc I decide to stop persecuting myself, and make a deal to live in peace and go ahead: no osc this year.</p>
<p>Maths have their say: statistically, more osc will be, more the chance to miss one will increase <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  ( I know still not a real excuses)</p>
<p>I would like to share my deep apologizes to the whole Greek Community in charge of OSC13. You all know, how I was and still am a big found of your commitment and really appreciate each of you.<br />
I will all miss you!</p>
<p>I really hope osc13 will stay in history as one of the ever greatest conference organized. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry Thessaloniki, I know how great the place is, kind the people are, etc..<br />
I&#8217;ll be back soon!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/factory-tested.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-9447 alignright" alt="factory-tested" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/factory-tested.png" width="217" height="232" /></a>Today, we&#8217;ve got for you an introduction of the teams&#8217; work on openQA by <em>Alberto Planas Domínguez</em>.</p>
<p>The last 12.3 release was important for the openSUSE team for a number of reasons. One reason is that we wanted to integrate QA (Quality Assurance) into the release process in an early stage. You might remember that this release had UEFI and Secure Boot support coming and everybody had read the scary reports about badly broken machines that can only be fixed replacing the firmware. Obviously openSUSE can&#8217;t allow such things to happen to our user base, so we wanted to do more testing.<span id="more-9440"></span></p>
<h2>Testing is hard</h2>
<p>Testing a distribution seems easy at first sight:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the ISO of the last build and put it on the USB stick</li>
<li>Boot from the USB</li>
<li>Install and test</li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>
<div id="attachment_9476" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/factory.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9476 " title="testing in progress!" alt="testing in progress!" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/factory_crop-300x169.png" width="300" height="169" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">testing in progress!</p></div>
<p>But look a bit further and you will see that, actually, only the installation process itself is already a <a title="free dictionary on combinatorial" href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/combinatorial" target="_blank">combinatorial</a> problem. In openSUSE we have different mediums (DVD, KDE and Gnome Live images, NET installation image and the new Rescue image), three official architectures (32 and 64 bits and ARMv7), a bunch of different file systems (Ext3 / Ext4, Btrfs, LVM with or without encryption, etc.), different boot loaders (GRUB 2, LILO, SHIM). <em>Yeah</em>&#8230; Even without doing the math you see that for only this small subset of variables we have hundreds of possible combinations. And this is just the installation process, we are not talking about the various desktops and applications or hardware like network interfaces or graphics cards here.</p>
<h3>And we want continuous testing</h3>
<p>And that is only the final testing round! If we want to be serious about QA and testing, we need to run the full test battery for every build that OBS generate for us, with extra attention to the Milestones, Betas and RC which are scheduled in the release road-map.</p>
<p>We can of course attempt to optimize our testing approach. For example, if I am the maintainer of a package and I sure that my last version is working perfectly in Factory (because I tested it in my system, of course), do I really need to test this application again and again when a new ISO build is released? Unfortunately, we can <em>not</em> take a shortcut here. As Distribution, our job is integration and so we need to test the entire product again for every build. A single change in an external library or in any other package which I depend on can break my package. The interdependencies for a integration project of the size of openSUSE are so intricate that is faster to run the full test again. With this approach we are avoiding regressions in our distribution, important during development. But also a lot of work &#8211; who has time for all this testing?</p>
<h2>OpenQA as a solution</h2>
<p>For us, there&#8217;s no doubt about it: <a href="http://openqa.opensuse.org/">openQA</a> is the correct tool for this. openQA is already used to test certain parts of openSUSE, and has shown itself as a competent tool to test other distributions like Fedora or Debian.</p>
<p>To experiment with openQA, the openSUSE team decided to launch a local implementation of the tool and start feeding it with 12.3 builds. But we soon ran into some limitation in the way we can express desired test outcomes in openQA and we got ideas on how to improve the detection of failed and succeeded tests. We also discovered that some tests in openQA had the bad habit of starting to work in <em>“monkey mode”</em> by simply sending commands and events to the virtual machine without checking if those interaction have expected behavior or not, losing track of the test progress.</p>
<p>openQA has the great benefit of being open source so we can improve its usefulness for testing Factory. Moreover, the original author of openQA, Bernhard M. Wiedemann, is a very talented developer and works for SUSE so upstream is very close to us. So we decided to start hacking!<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/stopwatch.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9448 alignright" alt="stopwatch" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/stopwatch-227x300.png" width="113" height="150" /></a></p>
<h2>openQA work</h2>
<p>After the 12.3 release we decided to spend some quality time improving openQA as a team project. This was managed using the public Chili (a Redmine fork) project management web application. We published all the milestones, tasks, goals and documentation in the <a href="http://board.opensuse.org/projects/openqa-improvement/">&#8220;openQA improvement project&#8221;</a>. The management side of this project perhaps needs a different post, but for now we can say that we tried to develop it as open as possible. Of course you can get the full code from <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/">the openSUSE github account</a>.</p>
<h2>Major changes</h2>
<p>The main architectural changes implemented during our 10 weeks of coding on openQA can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration with openCV</li>
<li>Replacement of PPM graphic file format with PNG</li>
<li>Introduced needles; test with better control of the state</li>
<li>A proper job dispatcher for new test configurations</li>
<li>Better internal scheduler, with snapshots and a way to skip tests</li>
<li>Improvement in the communication between webUI and the virtual machine</li>
</ul>

<h3>openCV brings robust testing</h3>
<p>The tests in openQA need to check what is happening in the virtual (or real) machine to verify results, and the main source of information is the output of the screen. This information is usually a graphical information: we can instruct QEMU (or Vbox) to retry screenshots in a periodic basis. To properly evaluate a test outcome we need to find some kind of information in those pictures, and for that we use the computer vision library openCV.</p>
<p>With this library we can implement different methods to find relevant sections of the image, like buttons, error messages or text. These are then used for the test to get information about the actual environment of the installation process and to find out if the test passed or not. Previously, checksums on the images were used to determine outcomes. This led to many false positives (tests failing too often) due to simple theming and layout changes &#8211; a single pixel changing broke the test. openCV support was introduced earlier by Dominik Heidler to enable testing with noisy analogue VGA capture and we extended the usage of openCV matching to be more versatile, powerful and easier to use (both for test-module-writers and for maintainers).<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63567936@N00/4210167891/" title="Headless Horse by Perry McKenna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2632/4210167891_dbfe5d540f_n.jpg" width="320" height="192" class="alignright" alt="Finding the needle"></a></p>
<h3>Introducing needles</h3>
<p>openQA has been modified to use PNG instead of PPM files to store images to test against, improving performance but also enabling openQA to store certain meta-data within the images. This brings us to the most important improvement in openQA: the introduction of the needle. A needle is an PNG image with some meta-data associated (a JSON document). This meta-data describes one or multiple &#8216;regions of interest&#8217; (RoI) in the original image which can be used by the test to match the current screenshot. For example, if the installation is in the partition manager and we send the expected keystrokes to set Btrfs as our default file system, we can assert that this option is currently set using a needle where the RoI has the correct check box marked. In other words: we create a needle with an area covering the check box. The system will search this area in the current screen to assert that there is, somewhere, a check box with this label correctly marked. And will use openCV to make sure that slight changes in theming or layout will not result in a failed test.</p>
<p>The needle concept is really powerful. When a test uses needles with multiple RoI&#8217;s, the system will try to match every area in the current screenshot, in whatever position. There are areas that can be excluded, and areas that can be processed using an OCR (Tesseract) to extract and match text from them.</p>
<p>Thanks to needles we can now create tests that are always in a known state and they can inform complex decisions about the next step to take. For example, we can have tests that can detect and respond correctly when a sudo prompt appears suddenly, or where an error dialog appears when is not expected. More important, we can detect errors more quickly, aborting the installation process and pointing the developer to the exact error.</p>
<h3>Faster testing with snapshots</h3>
<div id="attachment_9477" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/results.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9477" title="Test result overview" alt="Test result overview" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/results_crop-300x172.png" width="300" height="172" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Test result overview</p></div>
<p>We also implemented a way to create snapshots of the virtual machine status. This is useful if we want to retry some tests, or start the test-set from a specific test. For example, if we are testing the Firefox web browser, we want to avoid all the installation tests, and maybe some of the tests related with other applications. With this snapshot feature, we can load the virtual machine in the state where Firefox can be tested immediately.</p>
<h3>Improved web UI</h3>
<p>The final major area of focus has been on the web interface. We designed a set of dialogs to create and edit needles. Using this editor we can also see why the current tests are failing, comparing the current screenshot with the different expected needles from the tests.</p>
<p>Also, from the web interface we can control the execution of the virtual machine: signaling to stop or continue the execution. This is a feature that is useful when we want to create needles in an interactive way.</p>
<h2>Upstream</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re very happy that Bernhard has helped us, both with work and advice, to get these changes implemented. Several improvements were integrated in the <a href="https://github.com/bmwiedemann/os-autoinst/">current production version of openQA</a> and most of the more invasive ones are part of the V2 branch of openQA. We plan to sit together with Bernhard to see about deploying V2 to <a title="openQA in action" href="http://openqa.opensuse.org/results/" target="_blank">openqa.opensuse.org</a> for testing factory as soon as possible.</p>
<p>There is still work to be done. For example, for full integration testing we need to expand on the current ability which allows to run the tests on real hardware. This will for example allow testing graphics and network cards. Also, writing proper documentation is on the todo list. For those interested in helping out putting openQA to work and keeping the quality of our distribution high, the <a title="openSUSE Conference site" href="http://conference.opensuse.org" target="_blank">openSUSE Conference</a> will feature a workshop on creating tests for Factory.</p>

Dear community, I would like to present and get your feedback about a new project called bareos [<a href="http://www.bareos.org" target="_blank">1</a>]</p>
<p>I discovered it 6 months ago, after starting to be more and more annoyed by the way the bacula&#8217;s community edition was driven and developed. Even if I was using it since version 1.32 &#8230; First of all, I wish to be clear and shout out my respect to all the work done by Kern on Bacula or any other contributor. We have a really nice working software. We even have a nice build packages for it on OBS.<br />
But it&#8217;s stalled &#8230;</p>
<p>My personal frustration started with the creation of Bacula Enterprise, which has until now never (from what I&#8217;ve seen) reversed an Enterprise feature back to the community. Which in my sense would have been a clear statement &amp; commitment from the Bacula Enterprise to the community.<br />
A Free Software is free once it has been paid once. And more the time pass, more the community edition look like abandoned (windows client binary, bweb, &#8230;) Okay I can understand the enterprise&#8217;s edition arguments, the point is not there according to me.</p>
<p>So at the end of last year, I&#8217;ve started looking what else could replace Bacula for my own usage, and the small/medium customers I serve. Digging on github (my favorite source forge) I discovered bareos project. Basically Bareos is a fork of bacula community edition. With active contribution, and look like what I was looking for. Bareos is a compatible (at the time of writing) drop&#8217;in replacement which offers a bunch of nice feature I was waiting for. Especially high quality windows clients. The whole being cooked on a private obs instances, tested with jenkins, travis &#8230;</p>
<p>Okay I was disappointed about the fact it was a fork, but their website explains the why for those who wish to know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve then started to use it (easy to try with the number of supported platforms) and ready to use package. (Thanks to open build service [2]) Some installations were kept in a compatible way, other in native bareos way. The transition was really easy for anybody knowing how bacula works. After 3 months of production, including full restore, virtual machine backup, etc, I qualified it to be really production ready. Hey the base code and the way patches have been handled certainly explain those results. I also appreciate the effort to make bareos almost ready to use after installation. Trying to reduce the entry level ticket.</p>
<p>The remaining concerns I&#8217;ve found:<br />
- The community behind will have to grow and success in a truly transparent way.<br />
- Get new contributors (challenge is the same for bacula, but forking and propose request merge on github is really more cool than email patches)<br />
- The full remake of the documentation (work in progress)<br />
- Get a perfect web bconsole<br />
My best hope:<br />
- Make sustainable, the business plan associated with bareos.com and thus continue to produce quality community software</p>
<p>So did some of you already test it?<br />
What&#8217;s your own feedback, your thoughts about it?</p>
<p>Regards.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s Hack Week 9 at SUSE, and I&#8217;m working on a cracking project this time around. I&#8217;ve codenamed it &#8216;KLyDE&#8217;, for K Lightweight Desktop Environment, and it&#8217;s an effort to point KDE at the lightweight desktop market.  Surely some mistake, you say?  KDE and lightweight kan&#8217;t fit in the same sentence.  I think they can.</p>
<p>This project has been bouncing around my head for a couple of years now, starting on a train ride back from the KDE PIM meeting in Osnabrück in 2010, then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lfAjdtwECc">I presented it at COSCUP 2012</a> in Taiwan last August. But work commitments and family always got in the way of completing/finishing it.  SUSE&#8217;s hack week gives me 40 hours to throw at it and this time I wasn&#8217;t going to tackle it alone, so I enlisted my bro(grammer)s Jos and Klaas.</p>
<p>As has been repeated on Planet KDE over the past decade, KDE is not intrinisically bloated.  At its core, it jumps through a lot of hoops for memory efficiency and speed, and is modular to a fault. But most packagings of KDE take a kitchen sink approach, and when you install your KDE distribution you get a full suite of desktop, applets and applications.  The other major criticism of KDE is that it is too configurable.  The KlyDE project applies KDE&#8217;s modularity and configurability to the challenge of making a lightweight desktop.  However, what I don&#8217;t want to do is a hatchet job where functionality is crudely chopped out of the desktop to fit some conception of light weight.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re approaching problem from 3 sides:</p>
<p><strong>Minimal footprint</strong></p>
<p>The first method of attacking this is by packaging. It involves factoring optional components of the KDE desktop out of the base installation into subpackages that the main packages only have weak dependencies upon, allowing a minimal installation without them.  This targets big lumps of ram/cpu usage and objects of user hatred like Nepomuk and Akonadi, but also smaller items like Activities and Attica (social desktop support) and non-core window decorations/styles/etc.  The actual KDE build includes everything; the optional components are always available, so those who do need one of them can just add the package and start using it.</p>
<p>The second approach is by configuration.  This allows different profiles of KDE desktop with the same installed packages.  We&#8217;ve collected sets of configs that represent these profiles, but I&#8217;m not entirely sure how to package this yet.  One way would be to ship default profiles as X sessions.  Another would be a first run wizard or KCModule so users can select profile and apply it to their configuration after login.</p>
<p><strong>Simple config</strong><br />
Is a mixture of usability and perception.  A simplified configuration presents fewer choices and is therefore easier to understand.  It also looks faster and more lightweight, because people equate visual simplicity with efficiency.  This is incorrect, of course, but I&#8217;m not above exploiting this fallacy to give people what they want. For this aspect, we&#8217;re providing an alternate set of System Settings metadata to give it a cut down tree.  The full set remains available, if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Fast startup</strong></p>
<p>Is the most high-risk-for-reward effort.  It&#8217;s mostly a perception/first impression thing.  A working desktop shouldn&#8217;t need to be started up all the time.  But for people trying out KLyDE for the first time, a fast startup supports the claim to minimalism.  The interesting thing I note so far is that the package splitting and configuration in 1) makes very little different to startup time.  The optional components of KDE are already highly optimised to not affect startup time.  So I&#8217;m investigating alternate startup systems; refactoring startkde, Dantti&#8217;s systemk, Plasma Active&#8217;s startactive, and a systemd-managed startup.</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong></p>
<p>The packaging effort is mostly done; we have packages in an <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Awstephenson%3Aworkbench%3Aklyde">Open Build Service project</a>, that give you a bare Plasma Workspace when installed on top of a minimal X SUSE 12.3 installation with &#8211;no-recommends.</p>
<p>Jos has put a great effort into understanding System Settings and has produced a simple layout, I just need to complete my patch to allow it to use the alternative metadata scheme at runtime.  If we have time, we&#8217;ll also customise some KCMs to provide a simple way to control KDE&#8217;s theming.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been busy converting systemd, kdeinit and ksmserver into a native systemd startup by defining systemd unit files.  It&#8217;s a steep learning curve as it exposes a number of assumptions on both sides, but I&#8217;m getting there.  The unoptimised systemdkde.target starts up in 4s here, vs 6s for the same .kde4 started by startkde.  That might be due to legacy/fault tolerance parts of startkde being left out, so I won&#8217;t give more detailed numbers yet.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p>You can see the state of the project on <a href="https://trello.com/board/klyde/515be014e9d9a5cf48007e01">Trello</a>. I&#8217;d like to see if there is a startup time  win by parallelizing kded and ksmserver starting modules and apps. I&#8217;d like to make an openSUSE pattern for existing installations, and an iso or a disk image for testers.  I&#8217;ve also submitted a talk on the subject for Akademy, so I&#8217;d like to work on that and get some real data to support this work.</p>
