          <div class="entry">
            <p>As promised in previous posts, we want to share with you our experience and views from this year annual Ruby conference <a href="http://euruko2016.org">Euruko</a>. Maybe &#8220;our&#8221; is too much to say, since we only sent one developer there. So to be precise, these are Josef Reidinger&#8217;s experience and views on the conference.</p>
<p>This year Euruko took place in Sofia, capital of Bulgaria. It turned out to be a great conference place. Public transport works very well, everyone speak English and even when it uses Cyrilic alphabet, almost everything is written also in Latin one.</p>
<p>That being said, let&#8217;s talk about the conference content. Fortunately all the presentations were recorded so you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChGs1td4ViQFqT0jlvkyUJg">watch them yourself</a>. But since it would be quite some hours of video to go through, we have reviewed some presentations for you including access to the corresponding videos.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the three presentation Josef specially recommend to watch.</p>
<p><b>Keynote by Matz</b></p>
<p>He speaks about how Ruby 3 will probably look in distant future. With &#8220;distant future&#8221; meaning &#8220;for sure not in next two years&#8221;. If you cannot wait, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that Ruby 2.4 will be released on December.</p>
<p>Ruby 3 will use guild membership concurrency model. The most interesting part of the talk is digging into rationale of typed versus non-typed languages and what can be the Ruby future in that regard.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aHmArEq4y0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><b>Rules, Laws and Gently Guidelines by Andrew Radev</b></p>
<p>Interesting view about common design principles, common mistakes when applying them and looking to them from different angles. Also explaining how to handle situations in which several design principles seem to contradict each other.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BDXQ4pcbEBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><b>Elixir by Jose Valim</b></p>
<p>Interesting intro to Elixir language. What it is, why it make sense to use it and what are its benefits. Josef&#8217;s impression was that Elixir&#8217;s idea is similar to isolated micro-services communicating via messages, with nice introspection and scalability.</p>
<p>But we have more team members with something to say about Elixir. Like Imobach, who has been playing with Elixir (and <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a>) for some time now. And Imobach really likes Elixir, so he would like to add some more bits of information for those who are interested.</p>
<p>For example, he would like to highlight that Elixir uses BEAM, the Erlang virtual machine, so great support for concurrency is backed in the platform. Concurrency sits on the concept of Erlang processes and it&#8217;s pretty common to use them for all kind of tasks (from computation to storing state, etc.). Imobach would like to encourage all developers out there to take a look to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform">OTP (Open Telecom Platform)</a>. Who needs micro-services at all? </p>
<p>Last but not least, take into account that Elixir is a functional language, so if you have an object-oriented mindset (like most Ruby developers) it will take some time to wrap your head around it.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xhwnHovnq_0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>Other presentations</h3>
<p><b>Little Snippets by Xavier Noria</b></p>
<p>Summary of common inefficiency in small snippets. Small things that matter, although most of them should be already known by the average Ruby developer. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC9TyVeER_8">Video</a>)</p>
<p>Since we mention the topic, some YaST team members has found <a href="https://github.com/JuanitoFatas/fast-ruby">this cheat sheet</a> by Juanito Fatas about Ruby optimization to be quite useful.</p>
<p><b>Rails + Kafka by Terence Lee</b></p>
<p>Apache Kafka is yet another messaging system. This talk did not manage to convince Josef to use it, but maybe it makes sense in some scenarios like HPC or HA. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl3JmF3n2bQ">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>Graphql on Rails by Marc-Andre Giroux</b></p>
<p>The typical REST setup is sometimes not scalable enough due to the excess of endpoints. The Graphql language is designed to specify what resources are needed from a server in a single query. The result is returned as JSON and the request specification looks also similar to JSON. Caching is done on client side. Interesting for web stuff and already used by Facebook, Shopify and others. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V96jduEvjY">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>Evolution of engineering on call team by Grace Chang</b></p>
<p>How to maintain services, how to scale when the grow, preventing burnout and so on. Specially interesting for us since there are many similarities with YaST maintenance. Maybe the end of the talk is a bit theoretic and idealistic. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_7wrPXaSto">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>Sprockets by Rafael Franca</b></p>
<p>Not specially interesting intro to assets generation used by Rails. People doing some assets generation with Rails would most likely already know all the content. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbM_1wRVfeI">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>Contribute to Ruby core by Hiroshi Shibata</b></p>
<p>Presentation about Ruby core development infrastructure, rules, etc. Certainly not the best talk ever. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRfsakcZJKw">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>Consequences of insightful algorithms by Carina C. Zona</b></p>
<p>Interesting presentation about conflicts between algorithms and real humans, especially with data-mining. Unfortunately, the second half turned to be too emotional and not technical enough for Josef&#8217;s taste :). (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp4yFKw_1QM">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>Viewing Ruby Blossom &#8211; Hamani by Anton Davydov</b></p>
<p>Introduction to yet another Ruby web framework. Not that interesting for us. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L6I4UoK8xM">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>A Year of Ruby, Together by Andre Arko</b></p>
<p>Introduction on how the open source community infrastructure behind Rubygems and Bundler is ran. How they get money to improve stuff, how they maintain their servers&#8230; Good talk about hard times keeping open source infrastructure alive. Interesting talk for any open source project. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJddsEfvcW8">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>What I Have Learned from Organizing Remote Internship for Ruby Developers by Ivan Nemytchenko</b></p>
<p>Talk describing an attempt to scale internship for a lot of students. Josef had a small chat with the author about Google Summer of Code after the presentation. He looked interested. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-K0ZKOclBU">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>The Illusion of Stable APIs by Nick Sutterer</b></p>
<p>Not Josef&#8217;s cup of tea. The presenter probably went a little bit too far trying to be funny all the time. The core of the presentation was about three examples of API that needed to be changed &#8220;just&#8221; because the rest of the world changed. So the whole presentation can be shortened to one sentence &#8211; your API will only remain static if the world remains static. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvHwTtsIH8g">Video</a>)</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>That was all from Sofia. See you again in approximately one week, just in time for the report of our 28th Scrum sprint.</p>

            <p>Another three weeks of development come to an end&#8230; and our usual report starts. Take a look to what we have been cooking. </p>
<h3>Read-only proposal modules</h3>
<p>This week, during <a href="http://www.susecon.com/">SUSECon 2016</a>, SUSE announced an exciting upcoming new product. SUSE CASP &#8211; a <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> based Container As a Service Platform.</p>
<p>That has, of course, some implications for the installer, like the need of some products (like CASP) to specify a fixed configuration for some subsystems. For example, an established selection of packages. The user should not be allowed to change those fixed configurations during installation.</p>
<p>We have implemented a possibility to mark some modules in the installation proposal as read-only. These read-only modules then cannot be started from the installer and therefore their configuration is kept at the default initial state.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/readonly.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/readonly-300x225.png" alt="Software and firewall proposals as read-only" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12099" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/readonly-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/readonly-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/readonly.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>In this sprint we have implemented a basic support in the proposal framework, in the future we could improve the respective proposal modules to better handle the read-only mode.</p>
<h3>Per product Btrfs subvolumes handling</h3>
<p>The ability to have read-only proposals is not the only improvement we have introduced in YaST to make SUSE CASP possible.</p>
<p>When Btrfs is used during the installation, YaST2 proposes a list of subvolumes to create. Unfortunatelly, that list is hard-coded and it&#8217;s the same for every (open)SUSE product&#8230; until now.</p>
<p>Starting on yast2-storage 3.1.103.1, a list of subvolumes can be defined in the product&#8217;s control file along with additional options (check out <a href="https://github.com/yast/skelcd-control-SLES/blob/master/control/control.SLES.xml#L190">SLES</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yast/skelcd-control-openSUSE/blob/master/control/control.openSUSE.xml#L297">openSUSE</a> examples to learn more).</p>
<pre>
&lt;subvolumes config:type="list"&gt;
  &lt;subvolume&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;boot/grub2/i386-pc&lt;/path&gt;
    &lt;archs&gt;i386,x86_64&lt;/archs&gt;
  &lt;/subvolume&gt;
  &lt;subvolume&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;home&lt;/path&gt;
  &lt;/subvolume&gt;
  &lt;subvolume&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;opt&lt;/path&gt;
  &lt;/subvolume&gt;
  &lt;subvolume&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;var/lib/libvirt/images&lt;/path&gt;
    &lt;copy_on_write config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/copy_on_write&gt;
  &lt;/subvolume&gt;
&lt;/subvolumes&gt;
</pre>
<p>This specification supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabling copy-on-write for a given subvolume (it&#8217;s enabled by default).</li>
<li>Enabling the creation of a subvolume only for a set of architectures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improved AutoYaST Btrfs subvolumes handling</h3>
<p>AutoYaST Btrfs subvolumes handling has been also improved. Using almost the same syntax as for product control files, you can disable the <code>CoW</code> behavior for a given subvolume.</p>
<p>Of course, if you don&#8217;t need such a feature, you won&#8217;t need to adapt your profiles to the new syntax as it&#8217;s backward compatible. You can also mix both of them:</p>
<pre>
&lt;subvolumes config:type="list"&gt;
  &lt;subvolume&gt;home&lt;/subvolume&gt;
  &lt;subvolume&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;var/lib/libvirt/images&lt;/path&gt;
    &lt;copy_on_write config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/copy_on_write&gt;
  &lt;/subvolume&gt;
&lt;/subvolumes&gt;
</pre>
<p>On the other hand, if you&#8217;re running SLES, you&#8217;ll know that a subvolume called <code>@</code> is used as the default Btrfs subvolume. Now is possible to turn-off such behavior in the profile&#8217;s general section.</p>
<pre>
&lt;general&gt;
  &lt;btrfs_set_subvolume_default_name config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/btrfs_set_subvolume_default_name&gt;
&lt;/general&gt;
</pre>
<h3>Disable installer self-update by default</h3>
<p>We have talked many times in this blog about the new self-update functionality for the installer. As expected, this functionality will debut in SLE-12-SP2 but with a small change in the original plan. In order to ensure maximum consistency in the behavior of SLE-12-SP1 and SP2 installers, the self-update functionality will be disabled by default. Not a big deal, since enabling it to get the latest fixes will be just a matter of adding a boot option in the initial installation screen.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: adapted EFI proposal in yast2-bootloader</h3>
<p>The previous report about the status of the storage stack reimplementation finished with the following cliffhanger &#8220;<i>we have in place all the ingredients to cook an installable ISO</i>&#8220;. So, as expected, we worked during this sprint in adapting the bootloader proposal to the new storage layer. As you can see in the following screenshot, we succeeded and the installer can already propose a valid grub2 setup to boot an EFI system.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/grub2efi.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/grub2efi-300x225.png" alt="EFI proposal with the storage-ng ISO" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12100" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/grub2efi-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/grub2efi-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/grub2efi.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Does that mean that the testing ISO for the new storage stack is already fully installable? Unfortunately not. Why not, you ask? The reason is, in fact, kind of fun.</p>
<p>The current partitioning proposal only works with MS-DOS style partition tables because we wanted to address the most complicated case first. On the other hand, we intentionally restricted the adaptation of the bootloader proposal to the EFI scenario. And you know what? We found out that combination (MS-DOS partition table + EFI) <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1008289">does not currently work</a> in Tumbleweed, so it neither does in our Tumbleweed-based testing ISO.</p>
<p>We will work during the following sprint to support another scenario. And hopefully we will not choose again an unsupported or broken one. 😉</p>
<h3>Letting libYUI run free: first visible steps</h3>
<p>As you know, YaST has both a graphical and a textual interface. They run on the same code thanks to an abstraction layer called LibYUI. Originally it served YaST only, but over time other projects started using it, notably the admin panel in Mageia. Moreover, the developers of those projects started to contribute fixes and improvements to LibYUI&#8230; faster than we can cope with.</p>
<p>Recently we decided to give the people outside the YaST team more power in the LibYUI project. To make that possible ensuring it does not affect YaST stability, we have been enabling more continuous integration tests.</p>
<p>As a first fruit of the revamped collaboration, we have merged a fix contributed by Angelo Naselli of Mageia regarding selection of tree items. As soon as we complete our continuous integration setup (of course we will keep you informed), more fixes and improvements will come for sure.</p>
<h3>More bug squashing and bug paleontology</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/10/20/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-26/">previous report</a> we presented our new effort to integrate the fix of low-priority bugs into the Scrum process. During this sprint we refined the idea a little bit more, distinguishing two separate concepts (each of them with its own <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2007/march/glossary-of-scrum-terms#1130">PBI</a>) &#8211; fixing of existing bugs and closing of too old ones.</p>
<p>The first one doesn&#8217;t need much explanation. We managed to fix around 25 non-critical bugs in YaST and if you are using Tumbleweed you are probably already benefiting from the result.</p>
<p>The second task was not exactly about fixing bugs present in the software, but about cleaning bugzilla from bug reports that were simply too old to be relevant any more. Like bugs affecting very old versions of openSUSE that cannot be reproduced in openSUSE 13.2 or Leap. We must be realistic about releases that are already out of support and the limited human resources we have. We closed around 80 of those ancient bugs.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/no_country_for_old_bugs.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/no_country_for_old_bugs-300x169.jpg" alt="no_country_for_old_bugs" width="300" height="169" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12105" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/no_country_for_old_bugs-300x169.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/no_country_for_old_bugs.jpg 569w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>So overall, we cleaned up around one hundred bugs from our queue. Still a long way to have a bug-free YaST, but undoubtedly a step in the right direction. </p>
<h3>More coming</h3>
<p>We are already working in the next sprint that will hopefully bring several new improvements for CASP, quite relevant progress in the storage reimplementation, several usability improvements, some bugfixes and even some news about this blog.</p>
<p>To make sure you don&#8217;t get bored while waiting we are also planning to finally publish the report about our visit to <a href="http://euruko2016.org/">Euruko 2016</a>.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>We did our best to keep you entertained during this development sprint with a couple of blog posts (<a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12019">[1]</a> and <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12030">[2]</a>). But now the sprint is over and it&#8217;s time for a new report.</p>
<h3>Squashing low priority bugs</h3>
<p>One of the main reasons to adopt Scrum was to ensure we make a good use of our development resources (i.e. developers&#8217; time and brains) focusing on things that bring more value to our users. In the past we had the feeling that many important things were always postponed because the developers were flooded by other not so important stuff. Now that feeling is gone (to a great extent) and we have a more clear and shared view of the direction of our development efforts.</p>
<p>But there is always a drawback. We have accumulated quite some unsolved low-priority bugs. That was an expected consequence, but still it was starting to feel wrong. On one hand, it makes us feel uncomfortable &#8211; replying &#8220;this will have to wait&#8221; so often is not nice, even if it&#8217;s for the shake a bigger goal. On the other hand, the amount of low-priority stuff was affecting the signal/noise ratio on Bugzilla, making harder to distinguish the important stuff.</p>
<p>So far, dealing with those low-priority bug was something that each developer did on his own, as permitted by the time dedicated to Scrum. In sprint 26 we decided to make that effort an explicit part of the process and to devote a significant portion of the sprint to it. As a result we closed or reassigned a total of 135 bugs that were just sitting in our list.</p>
<p>Yes, you did read it right. One hundred and thirty five bugs.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: our testing ISO can already destroy your data</h3>
<p>On the previous sprint we already showed a screenshot of the installer using the new storage stack to calculate a partitioning proposal. Now the installer can go one step further. As you can see on this animation, the changes are now committed to the disk, meaning the system is actually partitioned, formatted and installed.</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/demo_commit_to_disk.gif" alt="Installation with the new storage stack"></p>
<p>The process is interrupted after installing the software, when trying to configure and install the bootloader. That was expected because yast2-bootloader has still not been adapted to use the new stack. First of all, because we wanted to leave some fun for sprint 27. But also because we used this sprint (26) to document <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-bootloader/blob/master/doc/boot_storage_needed_info.md">all the requirements of yast2-bootloader</a> in relation to the new storage stack. Now we have in place all the ingredients to cook an installable ISO.</p>
<h3>Automatic update of translation files</h3>
<p>Recently openSUSE has adopted <a href="https://weblate.org">Weblate</a> to perform and coordinate the translation of the software and the project&#8217;s web pages. The <a href="https://l10n.opensuse.org/">openSUSE&#8217;s Weblate instance</a> enables everybody (from dedicated translators to casual contributors) to take part in the process and makes possible to coordinate the translations of openSUSE with the ones for SUSE Enterprise Linux, boosting collaboration between the translators of both projects.</p>
<p>As YaST developers, is of course our responsibility to ensure that openSUSE&#8217;s Weblate contains always the latest English strings to be translated. Making our developer&#8217;s life easier sometimes not only brings advantages for us but also for our users. Until now, after each code change we had to keep in mind to trigger the translation process for every added or changed English text. Sometimes we were not quick enough so that some English leftovers remained in our awesome YaST when being used in one of the 20 languages where the translation is normally 100% complete.</p>
<p>Now we finally set up a <a href="https://ci.opensuse.org/">Jenkins</a> job to automate the process of triggering the translation update after code changes. This saves the developers some work and makes the update of translations even faster.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://l10n.opensuse.org/languages/">Weblate numbers</a>, you can see we have 20 languages that are about 100% translated, another 20 that are translated more than 75% and 37 languages which are translated less than 75%. So we still need some help to bring all languages to 100% coverage. If you are willing to contribute, why not join our team of translators? Check out <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Localization_guide">the localization guide</a> to get in contact with the coordinators of your preferred language to learn about how to contribute with translations, reviews or by any other mean.</p>
<h3>Ensure installation of packages needed for booting</h3>
<p>We got some reports of systems not being able to work after the installation in scenarios in which the user had customized the list of packages to install. That happened because, although the bootloader component of YaST pre-selects for installation all the needed packages, the user can override that selection and manually disable the installation of those packages.</p>
<p>To prevent this situation, or at least to increase awareness of it, the installer now alerts in the summary screen (the last step before proceeding to installation) if some of the required packages is missing, as you can see in the screenshot below. We still allow the users to shoot their own feet if they insist, but now we warn them very clearly.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/softw.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/softw-300x226.png" alt="Warning about de-selected Grub2 package" width="300" height="226" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12057" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/softw-300x226.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/softw-768x578.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/softw-1024x770.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/softw.png 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Progress in the low-vision accessibility of the installer</h3>
<p>During this sprint, we have been working to make the (open)SUSE installer accessible to people with low-vision impairment. We already <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12019">blogged about it</a> looking for feedback.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/highc.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/highc-300x225.png" alt="One of the new color modes available in the installer" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12065" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/highc-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/highc-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/highc.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>In a few days, some changes will land in Tumbleweed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alternative style selection (color and font-sizes). Currently, we offer four options: default (no changes), high contrast (cyan/green/white/black), white on black and cyan on black. Those styles are just a proof of concept in order to test the code changes and, most important, to get feedback from you.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=768112">long-standing issue</a>, which prevented to switch to high-contrast mode during installation (shift+F4), has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/linuxrc.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/linuxrc-300x225.png" alt="Style selection at the beginning of installation" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12066" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/linuxrc-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/linuxrc-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/linuxrc.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />
Although we have made some progress, it is still an ongoing effort and we hope to release more improvements during the upcoming weeks.</p>
<h3>Recover from broken bootloader configuration</h3>
<p>There are situations in which YaST Bootloader is not able to read the system configuration. For example, when the udev device originally used by Grub2 is no longer available. In the past that leaded to YaST crashes, requiring a manual fix of the bootloader configuration files. Now YaST correctly detects the situation and offers the option to propose a new configuration with correct devices.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bootl.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bootl-300x170.png" alt="YaST bootloader fixing a broken configuration" width="300" height="170" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12058" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bootl-300x170.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bootl-768x435.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bootl-1024x580.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bootl.png 1346w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Disable autorefresh by default in local media</h3>
<p>We have changed the default autorefresh flag for the new repositories added by YaST. In the past the autorefresh was enabled for all repositories except CD/DVD media and ISO files.</p>
<p>With the new defaults the autorefresh is enabled only for remote repositories (like http, ftp, nfs,&#8230;). The reason is that some local repositories might not be always available (e.g. external hard disk, USB flash drive,&#8230;) and the automatic refresh might cause ugly errors when starting the package manager.</p>
<p>Of course, you can still manually change the autorefresh flag after adding a repository if you need a different value.</p>
<p><i>Note: The default has been changed in Tumbleweed distribution only, Leap 42.2 or SLE-12-SP2 keep the old defaults. The zypper behavior is unchanged as well, it by default disables autorefresh for all repositories. Only repositories imported from a .repo file have autorefresh enabled. See <code>man zypper</code> for more details.</i></p>
<h3>Tons of improvements in network bridge handling</h3>
<p>YaST Network is Swiss Army knife for network configuration which comprehends the management of routing, bonding, bridging and many other things. But, to be honest, the management of bridges was not in the best possible shape. It had quite some usability problems and it was not 100% consistent with the way in which bridges are managed nowadays by <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Wicked">Wicked</a> in (open)SUSE. Until now!</p>
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-network/pull/448">pull request</a> with several screenshots and animations tries to summarize all the changes that have been done during this sprint. Like adapting old configuration files to the new conventions or unifying the UI to make it consistent with the one for managing bonding.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bridge.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bridge-300x225.png" alt="Revamped YaST interface for handling bridges" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12077" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bridge-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bridge-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bridge.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>This revamp includes also quite some usability improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;NONE&#8221; is shown instead of 0.0.0.0 for old bridge configuration.</li>
<li>The bridge master is shown in the enslaved interface.</li>
<li>The interfaces overview is updated after a bridge is modified.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optimizing read of hosts file</h3>
<p>It was reported that yast2-network was slow in system with a lot of entries in the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file. We took that as an opportunity to test the new profiler support in YaST. The profiler revealed the problem was in some slow calls to <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/#system-configuration-repository-scr">SCR</a>, the layer traditionally used by YaST to interact with the underlying system&#8230; which sounded like another opportunity. This time an opportunity to expand the use of <a href="https://github.com/config-files-api/config_files_api">CFA</a> (the component we are developing to steady replace SCR) and its <a href="http://augeas.net/">Augeas</a> parser. Since Augeas already supports parsing of <code>/etc/hosts</code> files, it was quite straightforward to implement that into YaST&#8230; and the result is quite impressive.</p>
<p>The time needed to execute the next command in a system containing a huge <code>/etc/hosts</code> with around 10,000 entries (quite an extreme case, we know) was reduced from 75 seconds to just 20.</p>
<pre>
yast2 lan list
</pre>
<p>As you can see in <a href="https://github.com/config-files-api/config_files_api/pull/10">this pull request</a>, we also improved CFA itself, greatly reducing the time needed for reading configuration files with Augeas.</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s all&#8230; until next report</h3>
<p>Once again, we must conclude the report telling that this was just a small summary of all the work done during the sprint and that we will be back in three weeks with the next report. Or maybe before, now that we are starting to get used to blog more often.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Here comes the YaST team again trying to flood your aggregator with blog post! Now it&#8217;s time for the story of how we reduced the critical path of the rebuild time of YaST RPM packages from 42min 2s to 29min 40s.</p>
<h2>Chapter 1: where to optimize</h2>
<p>Of course, the first step to start fixing something is finding out what exactly needs to be fixed. In our case, this breaks down into</p>
<ol>
<li>knowing the dependencies, and</li>
<li>knowing the individual build times.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>It is tempting to figure out the dependencies by yourself, by parsing the spec files. But it is hard to do right, and, more importantly, a reinvention of the wheel. The Build Service must know all this to be able to schedule the builds, and provides a convenient way to access it, with <code>osc dependson</code>:</p>
<pre>
$ osc dependson YaST:Head openSUSE_Factory x86_64
[...]
yast2-x11 :
   yast2-devtools
yast2-xml :
   yast2-core
   yast2-devtools
yast2-ycp-ui-bindings :
   libyui
   yast2-core
   yast2-devtools
</pre>
<h3>Individual build times</h3>
<p>For each source package, the Build Service produces not only binary RPMs but also a <code>_statistics</code> file, available in the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/statistics/YaST:Head/yast2-core?arch=x86_64&amp;repository=openSUSE_Factory">web UI</a> or via <code>osc getbinaries</code>. We were interested in the total build time, although the data was of limited use because packages can be built on machines with vastly different power and this information is not included.</p>
<h2>Chapter 2: how to optimize</h2>
<p>Once we knew which screws needed to be tightened, it was time to do it. Fortunately we had more than one tool for the job.</p>
<h3>Stop using Autotools</h3>
<p>Autotools (automake, autoconf and configure) took up a majority of the time needed for building YaST packages. Now that most of those packages are written in pure Ruby, we don&#8217;t need autotools there checking for portability problems that we don&#8217;t have. Autotools are a leftover from the times 15 years back when they were the only sensible option. We <a href="https://twitter.com/timmartin2/status/23365017839599616">have wiped them out</a> where possible and have been <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-bootloader/commit/5fb46ea8046ea9863e5411ffe1394797e71dde1e">switching</a> to our own <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/packaging_rake_tasks">set of Rake tasks</a>.</p>
<h3>Stub the APIs used in tests</h3>
<p>We run a mixture of unit and integration tests at RPM build time. The downside of this is that we pull in many of the run time dependencies. Fortunately Ruby is a dynamic language and makes it easy to replace interfaces by stubs. That enables us to cut those dependencies.</p>
<p>
In fact, we also have some Perl code, notably in yast2-users. Although the stubbing techniques across languages are messier than with pure ruby, they are still effective for our purposes.</p>
<h3>Do not build specialized documentation</h3>
<p>This one is simple: if the development documentation is only useful for people that will check out the git repo anyway, then leave it out from the RPM.</p>
<h2>Appendix: the details</h2>
<p>
Enough of high-level explanations, we we promised you graphs, code and all kind of gory details, and a promise made is a debt unpaid. So there we go.</p>
<h3>Dependency graphs</h3>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words. That&#8217;s why we came up with <a href="https://github.com/mvidner/rpm-build-dependencies">this small tool</a> to generate a graphical representation of the dependencies of the YaST packages. In the resulting graphs displayed below, a node is a source package in the build service, and an arrow means &#8220;needs for its build&#8221;. Redundant arrows are omitted (that is, we&#8217;ve erased an A→C if both A→B and B→C existed).</p>
<p>
We can see that the most prominent conclusion is that there is a large number of packages that depend on yast2, a collection of basic libraries.</p>
<p>
But on top of that, in the original graph there are 6 more layers, and the graph is not very dense there. After our fixes, there are only 4 layers that are more dense.</p>
<p>Is worth mentioning that the &#8220;layer&#8221; concept only works if the packages take roughly the same time to build; it would not be helpful if there were huge variations. To get a more accurate picture, we should have generated a histogram of build times. But the graph was good enough in our scenario&#8230; and we had to stop the analysis at some point. 🙂</p>
<p>
The build dependency graph before our fixes:</p>

<h3>Build statistics</h3>
<p>If those graph are not geeky enough for you, here you are the detailed build statistics from the build service</p>
<pre>
&lt;buildstatistics&gt;
  &lt;disk&gt;
    &lt;usage&gt;
      &lt;size unit="M"&gt;1118&lt;/size&gt;
      &lt;io_requests&gt;15578&lt;/io_requests&gt;
      &lt;io_sectors&gt;2156642&lt;/io_sectors&gt;
    &lt;/usage&gt;
  &lt;/disk&gt;
  &lt;memory&gt;
    &lt;usage&gt;      &lt;size unit="M"&gt;580&lt;/size&gt; &lt;/usage&gt;
  &lt;/memory&gt;
  &lt;times&gt;
    &lt;total&gt;      &lt;time unit="s"&gt;756&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/total&gt;         &lt;!-- THIS --&gt;
    &lt;preinstall&gt; &lt;time unit="s"&gt;8&lt;/time&gt;   &lt;/preinstall&gt;
    &lt;install&gt;    &lt;time unit="s"&gt;72&lt;/time&gt;  &lt;/install&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;       &lt;time unit="s"&gt;555&lt;/time&gt; &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;download&gt;   &lt;time unit="s"&gt;4&lt;/time&gt;   &lt;/download&gt;
  &lt;/times&gt;
  &lt;download&gt;
    &lt;size unit="k"&gt;33564&lt;/size&gt;
    &lt;binaries&gt;53&lt;/binaries&gt;
    &lt;cachehits&gt;24&lt;/cachehits&gt;
    &lt;preinstallimage&gt;preinstallimage.preinstallimage.tar.gz&lt;/preinstallimage&gt;
  &lt;/download&gt;
&lt;/buildstatistics&gt;
</pre>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>This was definitely an interesting journey. We learned quite some  things. Specially we learned that there is still room for improvement, but most likely the time reduction will not pay off for the time invested implementing those improvements.</p>
<p>We have to be realistic and keep working in other interesting stuff to fuel the next sprint report, coming next week!</p>

            <p>In our <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=11983">latest report</a>, we promised you would not have to wait another three weeks to hear (or read) from us. And here we are again, but not with any of the anticipated topics (build time reduction and Euruko 2016), but with a call for help in a topic that could really make a difference for (open)SUSE.
</p>
<p>
Nowadays, YaST team is trying to fix a long-standing issue in the installer: <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=780621">low-vision accessibility</a>. In the past, a user could get a high-contrast mode just pressing shift+F4 during installation. Unfortunately, that feature does not work anymore and, to be honest, changing to a high-contrast palette is not enough. Other adjustments, like setting better font sizes, should be taken into account.
</p>
<p>
Another option is to use the textmode installation and set some obscure variable (<code>Y2NCURSES_COLOR_THEME</code>) to get the high-contrast mode. But it sounds like the opposite to <em>user friendly</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Some days ago, the team fired up the <a href="https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00593.html">discussion</a> in the opensuse-factory mailing list but we would like to reach as many people as we can to gather information and feedback about this topic. Getting some affected people involved in the process would be really awesome!
</p>
<p>For the time being we’re already working on some improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Adding a Linuxrc option so the user can set the high-contrast mode from the very beginning.
  </li>
<li>
    Fixing <a href="http://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=768112">shift+F4 support</a>.
  </li>
<li>
    Improving the high-contrast mode appearance. Below you can see a screenshot of the work in progress.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lowvision.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lowvision-300x225.png" alt="First prototype of the new high contrast mode" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12025" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lowvision-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lowvision-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lowvision.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>
  But we would like to hear from you. You can raise your voice in the already mentioned <a href="https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2016-09/msg00593.html">thread at the opensuse-factory mailing list</a> or leave a comment in the related <a href="https://github.com/libyui/libyui-qt/pull/60">pull request</a> at Github. If you prefer to have a chat, we&#8217;re also available on <a href="irc://irc.opensuse.org/yast">the #yast IRC channel</a> at Freenode&#8230; and we love to see people there. 😉
</p>
<p>
Please, join us to make YaST even better!</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Another development sprint is over. Time flies! In our <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/09/07/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-24/">previous post</a> we already reported about the branching of Tumbleweed and the upcoming releases and about the expected consequences: the landing of some cool features in a less conservative Tumbleweed.</p>
<p>We are still dedicating quite some effort to polish the upcoming stable releases (SLE12-SP2 and Leap 42.2), but in this sprint we finally found some time to play. Which is great because blogging about new features is more fun than doing it about bug fixes. 🙂</p>
<h3>Importing Authorized Keys with AutoYaST</h3>
<p>When logging in via SSH, public key authentication should be preferred over password authentication. Until now, the best way of setting up the required authorized_keys files in AutoYaST was using the files section.</p>
<p>However, that approach is tedious and error prone, as you need to make sure you set the correct owner, permissions, etc. Moreover you need to keep in sync the user definition (username and home directory) with the file definition.</p>
<p>AutoYaST now supports the specification of a set of public keys for each user with a pretty straightforward syntax:</p>
<pre>
&lt;user&gt;
  &lt;username&gt;suse&lt;username&gt;
  &lt;authorized_keys config:type="list"&gt;
    &lt;listentry&gt;ssh-rsa your-public-key-1&lt;/listentry&gt;
    &lt;listentry&gt;ssh-rsa your-public-key-2&lt;/listentry&gt;
  &lt;authorized_keys&gt;
&lt;user&gt;
</pre>
<p>AutoYaST takes care of writing the files and setting the ownership and the proper permissions.</p>
<p>While documenting this new feature we realized the AutoYaST documentation about users management could be more detailed, which leads us to&#8230;</p>
<h3>Improving the documentation</h3>
<p>Usually developers love to create programs loaded with cool features but hate to write documentation. Fortunately there are people out there who enjoy writing documentation and bringing all those features to light. We have already mentioned in previous reports how grateful we are for having the SUSE documentation team polishing and publishing our documentation drafts and how open and straightforward the process is.</p>
<p>We updated the YaST documentation to include information about the installer self-update feature, which will debut in SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SP2 and openSUSE Leap 42.2. As part of <a href="https://github.com/SUSE/doc-sle/pull/69">the same pull request</a> and in the AutoYaST side, some additional improvements were made, including cleaning-up some duplicated information about SUSE registration.</p>
<p>On the other hand and as a consequence of the above mentioned new feature, the AutoYaST documentation regarding users management has been rewritten adding missing information like groups, user defaults and login settings.</p>
<p>All our pull requests are already merged in the <code>doc-sle</code> repository. At a later point in time, the SUSE documentation team will review and polish all the new content (including ours) and will publish an up-to-date version of the online documentation. If you don&#8217;t want to wait, you can easily generate an HTML or PDF version of the documentation including all the non-reviewed contributions just following the very simple instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/SUSE/doc-sle/blob/develop/README.adoc">README file</a> of the <code>doc-sle</code> repository.</p>
<p>Did we already mention we love the open source, programmer-friendly processes of the documentation team? 😉</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: something you can touch</h3>
<p>We promised news about the storage reimplementation and here they are. Our customized Tumbleweed image (labeled as NewStorage) in the <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/storage-ng/images/iso/">storage-ng OBS repository</a> can now perform some simple actions during installation and display the result to the user.</p>
<p>First of all, when proposing the timezone settings it will, as usual, check for MS Windows installations in the disk to guess if the hardware clock should be set to UTC. The news is that check is performed using the new storage stack, that offers more functionality in every sprint.</p>
<p>More important is that the installer will show the partitioning proposal calculated also using the new stack. As you can see in the screenshot below, the screen is way more simpler than the one you would find in a regular Tumbleweed. There are no buttons to change the settings or to run the expert partitioner yet. That doesn&#8217;t mean the functionality is not there, it&#8217;s simply that we prefer to focus first on modifying all the installer steps to use the new stack (what will enable us to use openQA) before refining every screen to add all options there.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp-300x244.png" alt="The new partitioning proposal" width="300" height="244" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11987" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp-300x244.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp-768x624.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp-1024x833.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sp.png 1038w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Right now the system works only in disks containing a MS-DOS style partition table and will always propose a partition-based (no LVM) setup. That&#8217;s because we prefer to solve the hardest scenarios first. Using LVM and/or GPT partition tables is less challenging than the already supported scenario.</p>
<h3>Reduce global warming by saving OBS build power</h3>
<p>As you may know, we use the awesome <a href="http://openbuildservice.org/">Open Build Service</a> (OBS) to generate both the YaST rpm packages and the openSUSE/SLE ISO images. Every time the source code of any component changes, OBS rebuilds that component and all the packages that depend on it.</p>
<p>Our beloved openSUSE and SLE release managers told us that there were several YaST packages that often triggered rebuild of other YaST packages, that triggered yet another rebuild, that triggered&#8230; you got the idea. 😉</p>
<p>The mentioned problem slows down the creation of new ISO images, interferes with the continuous integration process (specially visible in Tumbleweed) and wastes valuable OBS resources.</p>
<p>During this sprint <b>we reduced the rebuild time of YaST by 30%</b>. That&#8217;s for sure interesting, but knowing the details about how we did it could be even more interesting for many readers. We feared the explanation could be too complex and technical to fit into this report&#8230; which gives us just another opportunity for blogging. So expect an upcoming post including interesting technical stuff and crazy graphs like this one.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yast_deps_after.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yast_deps_after-184x300.png" alt="YaST dependencies graph" width="184" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11989" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yast_deps_after-184x300.png 184w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yast_deps_after-768x1255.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yast_deps_after-627x1024.png 627w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yast_deps_after.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px" /></a></p>
<h3>Some adjustment for the installer in the LiveCDs</h3>
<p>One of the good things about working in open source is that sometimes the evolution of the projects you have created can surprise you. Quite some time ago, the YaST team dropped support for the live installer. It was simply too demanding to keep it alive while still doing our regular work (bug fixes and new features for YaST and the regular installer).</p>
<p>Recently the live installer was removed from Tumbleweed, the only system in which it was still available (after having been dropped in the past from stable openSUSE releases). One could have expected that somebody would decide then to step up and take the maintainership of the live installer.</p>
<p>But what actually happened was that Fabian Vogt decided to try a different approach we haven&#8217;t considered &#8211; adding the standard network installer to the LiveCDs images of Tumbleweed. He managed to make it work well enough and asked us for help to debug some problems. We fixed the initial problems by disabling the self-update functionality in the LiveCDs (it&#8217;s simply not designed to work on that scenario).</p>
<p>There are still quite some problems to be resolved to make everything work flawlessly, but if Fabian and others don&#8217;t give up, we will keep assisting them in order to bring the installation back to the LiveCDs&#8230; even in unexpected ways.</p>
<h3>UI Designer</h3>
<p>The YaST user interface is quite difficult to design and code. The main problem is that there <del>is</del> was no interactive UI designer where you could build a dialog or modify an existing one. Instead, you had to write new code or modify the existing code which creates and opens the dialog. Then, to see your changes you had to start the YaST module, go to the respective dialog and check its content. If it didn&#8217;t look like you intended, you had to close it, modify the code and start it again. And again&#8230; and again. Very annoying especially if the dialog is hidden deep in the module and you need to take several steps to get there.
</p>
<p>
During Hack Week 14, <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/14/projects/1522">a project to improve the situation a bit</a> was started. We already had a dialog spy which can be opened by Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Y keyboard shortcut, but that was read-only. You could only inspect the dialog tree and see the details of the selected widget but you could not change anything.
</p>
<p>During that Hack Week project it was improved so it could edit the properties of the existing widgets, remove them or even add some new widgets. However the code was more or less a proof of concept than ready to be merged into the YaST UI and released to public. So we decided to finish it in this sprint.</p>
<p>As usual, it was harder than expected&#8230; but we made it and here is a short demo showing how it works and what you can do there:</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ui-designer.gif" alt="The new UI designer in action" /></p>
<p>The new tool is still far from being perfect. The most obvious missing feature is that the dialog is changed in place and you cannot save or export you changes. After closing the dialog everything is lost. But it can still help to try things in the UI or make a quick prototype, specially when discussing solutions with interface designers. Hopefully we find some more time in the future to make it even better.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: encryption support</h3>
<p>Although the partitioning proposal still does not support encryption or LVM, we implemented full LUKS (encryption) support in the underlying library (libstorage-ng). Together with the LVM support implemented in the previous sprint, that makes the new library already a valid replacement for the old libstorage in many situations and scenarios. Now it&#8217;s mainly a matter of switching from one version to another in every single YaST component, starting with the expert partitioner that we plan to start redesigning in the next sprint.</p>
<p>As usual, new features in the library are hard to illustrate, unless you accept the action diagrams as screenshots. In that case, here you can see the sequence of actions performed by the library when creating an encrypted home volume.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/create.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/create-293x300.png" alt="Creation of an encrypted home with libstorage-ng" width="293" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11995" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/create-293x300.png 293w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/create.png 508w" sizes="(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px" /></a></p>
<h3>Syncing keyboard layouts and console fonts in Leap and Tumbleweed</h3>
<p>In parallel to our Scrum sprints, we have been for some time steady working, together with the openSUSE maintainers of X.Org and systemd, in redesigning how keyboard maps and console fonts are managed by YaST. Some changes were introduced in Tumbleweed some time ago but never made it to SLE (or Leap) because they needed more testing.</p>
<p>Recently Ludwig Nussel, the Leap&#8217;s release manager, decided that he wanted to sync 42.2 with Tumbleweed in that regard, using the new approach instead of the more conservative SLE one. Thus, we also invested quite some time coordinating again with Stefan Dirsch (X.Org) and Franck Bui (systemd) to push the changes just in time for the beta2 version of Leap 42.2&#8230; just in time to introduce <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1000565">bug#1000565</a>, that was honored with its inclusion in the list of <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Most_annoying_bugs_42.2_dev">most annoying bugs</a> in 42.2 Beta2.</p>
<p>The bright side is that a fix for the bug has already been provided (see bug report) and you can now finally test the new fonts and keyboard maps. Please, do so and provide feedback in order to get a properly localized Leap 42.2 release.</p>
<h3>See you soon</h3>
<p>As usual, this post was just a quick overview of the most interesting part of the sprint, because most people (including ourselves) don&#8217;t want to read about the boring part of the work, which is mainly fixing bugs.</p>
<p>The good news is that this time you will not have to wait another three weeks to read interesting stuff about YaST. As mentioned, we plan to publish a blog post about the reduction of the build time of YaST. And we will probably also publish a post about the visit of a YaST geecko to <a href="http://euruko2016.org/">Euruko 2016</a>.</p>
<p>So this time more than ever&#8230; stay tuned!</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>We are back to this blog after another three weeks of (mainly) bug-fixing. In the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=11935">previous post</a> we promised some news about the self-update functionality and about the LVM support in the new storage stack. We have that&#8230; and much more!</p>
<p>So this will be a long post, but it also hides some gems. You will have to keep reading in order to find them.</p>
<h3>Self-update improvements</h3>
<p>We have already mentioned in several previous reports the new self-update feature in YaST, which allows updating the installer itself before performing installation of the system.</p>
<p>But it turned out that the initial implementation had an important drawback. The self-update process happened after having performed some of the installation steps. Then, after updating the installer it was restarted and several of those steps lost their configuration or simply did their operations twice.</p>
<p>After some discussions we decided to move the self-update step earlier, at the very beginning. For downloading the updates we basically need just working network connection and initialized package management. So we moved the self-update step after the initial automatic network setup (DHCP) and added package initialization to the self-update step.</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/c9d6beac-6e93-11e6-853b-62063269b7dd.gif" alt="The self-update in action" /></p>
<p>As you can see the self-update step is the very first step in the installation workflow, the language selection and the EULA dialog is displayed <i>after</i> the self update is finished and YaST is restarted. That means all the following steps do not need to remember their state as they will not be called twice after the restart.</p>
<p>The disadvantage is that we had to drop some features. The self-update step happens before the language selection and the optional disk activation. That means by default the self-update progress (and potential error messages) will be displayed in English. But you can still use the &#8220;language&#8221; boot option and set the language manually via <i>linuxrc</i>.</p>
<p>On the bright side, we fixed like half a dozen of reported bugs just by relocating the self-update process. So we are pretty sure it&#8217;s worth the price.</p>
<p>For more details see the updated <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-installation/blob/master/doc/SELF_UPDATE.md">documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>Gem one: using the <code>info</code> boot parameter</h3>
<p>The <code>info</code> boot parameter is a pretty old <i>linuxrc</i> option but it is probably not known well. The parameter is an URL which points to a text file which can contain more boot options.</p>
<p>When we tested the updated self-update described above we needed to build a driver update disk and pass several boot options. To avoid repeating the same options on the boot command line and to share the boot options across the team we created an <code>info.txt</code> file with content like</p>
<pre>
insecure=1
startshell=1
dud=ftp://example.com/self_update.dud
</pre>
<p>Then you simply boot the installation with <code>info=ftp://example.com/info.txt</code> and <i>linuxrc</i> will read the additional parameters from the file. This can save you a lot of typing, especially if you need to repeat the tests many times.</p>
<h3>Fixed a security bug for 7 (yes, seven) different SLE releases</h3>
<p>Some weeks ago, during a routine code review, our security experts found a vulnerability in YaST&#8217;s libstorage related to the way we provide the encryption passwords to some external commands. It is debatable how dangerous this threat really is. It was never a problem during system installation, but it would affect admins who create encrypted partitions (mostly encrypted LVM physical volumes) or crypto files in the installed system.</p>
<p>A potential attacker with access to <code>/tmp</code> could intercept the password in the very precise moment in which the &#8220;cryptsetup&#8221; or &#8220;losetup&#8221; command are invoked by YaST. It&#8217;s really only a matter of milliseconds. But we don&#8217;t want to take any risks, however small they may be.</p>
<p>So not only did we fix that for the current code streams, we backported it to all the SLE releases out there that are still supported (even though in some cases it&#8217;s just a single customer) &#8211; back to SLES-10 SP3 from late 2009. That meant backporting the fix to no less than 7 SLE releases (for Leap, those fixes are picked automatically).</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this got more difficult the farther back in history we went: In a central library like libstorage, things are constantly changing because the tools and environment (kernel, udev, you name it) are constantly changing. There was only a single case where the patch applied cleanly; in all other cases, it involved massive manual work (including testing, of course).</p>
<p>Was this fun? No, it certainly was not. It was a tedious and most frustrating experience. Do we owe it to our users (paying customers as well as community users) to fix security problems, however theoretical they are? Yes, of course. That&#8217;s why we do those things.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: every LVM piece in its place</h3>
<p>As time permits, we keep adding new features to the future libstorage replacement. During previous sprints we added support to read and manipulate all kinds of LVM block devices (PVs, VGs and LVs) but an important aspect was missing: deciding the order of the operations is as important as performing them. We instructed the library about the dependencies between operations and implemented several automated test cases to ensure we don&#8217;t try to do not-so-smart things like removing a physical volume from a volume group and shrinking its logical volumes <i>afterwards</i>.</p>
<p>The good thing about our automated test-cases is that they generate nice graph that are quite useful to illustrate blog posts. 🙂</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/complex1-action.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/complex1-action-300x48.png" alt="One of the several added test-cases" width="300" height="48" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11972" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/complex1-action-300x48.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/complex1-action-768x122.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/complex1-action-1024x163.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/complex1-action.png 1531w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Gem two: enjoy Google Summer of Code result</h3>
<p>As you may know, openSUSE is one of the Free Software organizations selected to take part in Google Summer of Code 2016. For YaST that means we had the huge pleasure of having Joaquín Yeray as student. You can know more about him and his experience diving into YaST and Open Source in <a href="https://joaquinyeray.me/">his GSoC blog</a>. </p>
<p>But the openSUSE community is not only gaining a new member, we also have a new YaST module. The <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/yast2-alternatives">yast2-alternatives</a> package has already been accepted into Tumbleweed and will be also part of Leap 42.2. So we have a new gadget in our beloved configuration Swiss Army knife!</p>
<p>We liked Joaquín and his module so much that we are revamping the YaST development tutorial to be based on his module (instead of yast2-journal). He is already working on that, so hopefully we will have Joaquín around quite some time still. 😉</p>
<h3>Unify license handling screens</h3>
<p>We got a report about the license agreement screen in automatic installation (AutoYaST) being different to the one showed during common installation. So we decided to take a look to the problem and unify them. We are in a quite late phase of the development process of both the next SLE and the next Leap, so we decided to not unify the code but simply adapt one dialog to look like the other. Also we are after string freeze due to translations, so we had to use a trick and reuse another already translated text. We also took the opportunity to fix some small usability problems.</p>
<p>This is one of those cases in which some images are worth a thousand words, so in order to understand what we did, take a look at the description of <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-packager/pull/185">this pull request</a>, which includes many images (too many for this blog post).</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1c218406-693c-11e6-9c81-578b7ce30864.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1c218406-693c-11e6-9c81-578b7ce30864-300x230.png" alt="The new AutoYaST license screen" width="300" height="230" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11965" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1c218406-693c-11e6-9c81-578b7ce30864-300x230.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1c218406-693c-11e6-9c81-578b7ce30864-768x588.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1c218406-693c-11e6-9c81-578b7ce30864-1024x784.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1c218406-693c-11e6-9c81-578b7ce30864.png 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Smarter check to avoid duplicated repositories</h3>
<p>The openSUSE software server defines the online repositories which can be added during installation. The openSUSE DVD also specifies its own online repositories that are always added to the system. And these repositories overlap.</p>
<p>In openSUSE 42.1 it happened that one repository was added twice, even though there was already a check to avoid that. So we investigated why.</p>
<p>We found that the URLs for the problematic repository were not exactly the same, one of them had a trailing slash. Therefore we made the URL comparison more tolerant and if the URLs differ only by the trailing slash, they are still considered the same.</p>
<p>After the fix all repositories are added only once, without any duplicates.</p>
<h3>Gem three: we are looking for new teammates!</h3>
<p>After 12 sprint reports, most readers would have already realized that the life as a full-time YaST developer is everything but boring&#8230; and that we are always pretty busy. The fun and the work are better when you share them so&#8230; <a href="https://jobs.suse.com/job/nuremberg/linux-c-ruby-hero-global-location/3486/2930771">we are looking for a new hero</a> to join us in our journey.</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t feel hacking in YaST would be your thing, maybe you are interested in any of the other <a href="https://www.suse.com/company/careers">jobs at SUSE</a>.</p>
<h3>Improved documentation about YaST environment variables</h3>
<p>The behaviour of YaST can be affected by several environment variables, but not all of them are well known by everybody. During this sprint we also decided to invest some time documenting them better. The resulting document will be soon properly integrated in our <a href="http://yast.github.io/documentation.html">centralized documentation for developers</a>, but you can sneak it already <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast.github.io/blob/master/doc/environment-variables.md">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Branching Tumbleweed and the upcoming stable releases</h3>
<p>Most of the features and bug-fixes we have blogged about in the last months were incorporated to Tumbleweed, the upcoming Leap 42.2 and the future SLE 12-SP2, since we always try to keep those three codebases as close as possible to each other.</p>
<p>Now Leap 42.2 and SLE 12-SP2 are close enough to their release date, so we plan to be more conservative with the changes. At the end of this sprint we decided to branch the code for Tumbleweed and for the stable siblings. From now on, most exciting stuff will appear only in Tumbleweed, with SLE 12-SP2 and Leap 42.2 becoming more and more boring.</p>
<h3>And the wheel keeps on turning</h3>
<p>So that was a very minimal selection of the most interesting stuff from the just finished sprint. What comes next? Another sprint, of course! We have already planned some interesting stuff for it, like integrating the new partitioning proposal into the installer or finishing the <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/14/projects/1522">ultra-cool UI designer</a> that was started during latest Hack Week.</p>
<p>As always, you can follow development in a daily basis in the usual channels (<a href="irc://irc.opensuse.org/yast">#yast IRC channel</a> and the <a href="https://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/">yast-devel</a> mailing list) or wait another three weeks for the next sprint report. Meanwhile&#8230; have a lot of fun!</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>As already mentioned in our <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=11893">previous blog post</a>, with Leap 42.2 in Alpha phase and SLE12-SP2 in Beta phase, the YaST Team is concentrating the firepower in fixing bugs in the installer. We fixed more than 40 bugs in three weeks! The dark side is that most bug fixes are not juicy enough for writing a blog post&#8230; but there is always some interesting stuff to report.</p>
<h3>Integration of installer self-update with SCC and SMT</h3>
<p>The installer self-update feature integrates now with <a href="https://scc.suse.com">SUSE Customer Center (SCC)</a> and <a href="https://www.suse.com/products/subscription-management-tool">Subscription Management Tool (SMT)</a> servers. Until now, there were three different mechanisms to get the URL of the installer updates repository:</p>
<ul>
<li>User defined (using the `SelfUpdate` boot option).</li>
<li>Using an AutoYaST profile.</li>
<li>The default one, specified in the `control.xml` which is shipped in the media.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now YaST2 is able to ask for the repository URL to SCC/SMT servers. The details of how the URL is determined are <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-installation/blob/master/doc/SELF_UPDATE.md#where-to-find-the-updates">documented in the repository</a>.</p>
<h3>Fixes and enhanced usability in dialogs with timeout</h3>
<p>As you may know, it&#8217;s possible to install (open)SUSE in an automatic, even completely unattended, basis using AutoYaST. AutoYaST can be configured to display custom configuration dialogs to the user and wait for the reply a certain amount of time before automatically selecting the default options. Until now, the only way for the user to stop that countdown was to start editing some of the fields in the dialog.</p>
<p>We got a bug report because that functionality was not working exactly as expected in some cases so, in addition to fixing the problem, we decided to revamp the user interface a little bit to improve usability. Now there are more user interactions that are taken into account to stop the counter, specially we added a new &#8220;stop&#8221; button displaying the remaining seconds. You can see an example of the result below.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/06449188-55a9-11e6-9461-dfc352fff8d8.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/06449188-55a9-11e6-9461-dfc352fff8d8-300x199.png" alt="New layout for dialogs with timeout" width="300" height="199" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11944" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/06449188-55a9-11e6-9461-dfc352fff8d8-300x199.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/06449188-55a9-11e6-9461-dfc352fff8d8.png 682w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Following, as usual, the Boy Scout Rule we also took the opportunity to add automated tests to make that part of YaST more robust for the future.</p>
<h3>Automatically integrating add-on repositories during installation</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to extend the regular installation media by adding just a few extra packages or provide a number of fixed packages along with the media.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the installer can automatically register an add-on repository. All you have to do is to put the repository on the installation medium and to add a file <code>/add_on_products.xml</code> that points to this repository.</p>
<p>The file looks like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;add_on_products xmlns="http://www.suse.com/1.0/yast2ns"
    xmlns:config="http://www.suse.com/1.0/configns"&gt;
    &lt;product_items config:type="list"&gt;
        &lt;product_item&gt;
            &lt;name&gt;My Add-on&lt;/name&gt;
            &lt;url&gt;relurl://myaddon?alias=MyAddon&lt;/url&gt;
            &lt;priority config:type="integer"&gt;70&lt;/priority&gt;
            &lt;ask_user config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/ask_user&gt;
            &lt;selected config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/selected&gt;
            &lt;check_name config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/check_name&gt;
        &lt;/product_item&gt;
    &lt;/product_items&gt;
&lt;/add_on_products&gt;
</pre>
<p>You can define the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is the name of your repository</li>
<li><code>&lt;url&gt;</code> points the the repository location; you&#8217;ll likely want to use the <code>relurl</code> scheme here that gives the location relative to the main installation repository</li>
<li><code>&lt;priority&gt;</code> is the repository priority (lesser number means higher priority, the main installation repository has priority 99)</li>
<li><code>&lt;ask_user&gt;</code>: should the user be asked about adding the repository?</li>
<li><code>&lt;selected&gt;</code>: should the repository be automatically selected?</li>
<li><code>&lt;check_name&gt;</code>: should the repository&#8217;s actual name be matched against the value of the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> element?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can of course list several repositories in this file.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re too lazy to remember all this, <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/mksusecd">mksusecd</a> can do all this for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a set of new kernel packages you would like to use, do:</p>
<pre>
mksusecd --create new.iso --addon kernel-*.rpm --addon-name 'my kernel' sles12-sp2.iso
</pre>
<p>This creates a new iso based on <code>sles12-sp2.iso</code> that will install your new kernel packages instead.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: small steps for the code, giant leap for continuous integration</h3>
<p>During bug squashing we managed to find some time to keep the storage stack reimplementation rolling&#8230; slow and steady. The customized Tumbleweed images (labeled as NewStorage) in the <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/storage-ng/images/iso/">storage-ng OBS repository</a> are already able to analyze most systems, creating a representation of the system storage devices in memory that will be used to manipulate the disks and propose a partitioning schema. Unfortunately, this representation is only visible in the YaST logs since fixing installer bugs was more urgent than representing that information in the UI.</p>
<p>This turned to be an important milestone, not because of the functionality itself or the value of the code (we just added a couple of lines of Ruby code), but because for the first time the dependencies in some packages were switched from libstorage to libstorage-ng. That had important implications for the code organization and for our continuous integration infrastructure, specially the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> integration, which implies the generation of .deb packages. We can now say that our continuous delivery workflow (from Github to OBS, passing through Jenkins, Travis, Coveralls and Code Climate) is free of any trace of the old storage code.</p>
<p>In addition, we also did some good progress in LVM support in the new library, being able to recognize and manipulate in memory all kind of LVM structures.</p>
<h3>The joy of openness: updating the SUSE Linux Enterprise documentation</h3>
<p>An important part of our job, specially as a new release date approaches, is helping to shape the SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) documentation. One of the strongest points of SUSE products is the awesome SUSE&#8217;s documentation team which, as the rest of the company, have open source in their genes. Suggesting improvements and updates for the documentation is as straightforward as creating a pull request in the completely open <a href="https://github.com/SUSE/doc-sle/">documentation repository at Github</a>&#8230; and anybody can do it!</p>
<p>The documentation team uses Docbook, but they would accept contributions in other formats (e.g. Markdown) and transform it themselves into Docbook&#8230; just because they are that cool. 🙂</p>
<h3>Better support for ARM systems using EFI</h3>
<p>The world is getting full of cool ARM64 devices and both SUSE and openSUSE are actively working in supporting as many of them as possible. We took another small step during this sprint improving the installer&#8217;s partitioning proposal for ARM systems that use EFI.</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s not all, folks</h3>
<p>As we always say, this was just the small portion of the work done that we consider exciting enough to be part of our development reports, since we don&#8217;t want to bore you with details about every single fixed bug. During this installer bug-fixing phase, this is more true than ever and the next sprint, which is already planned, will be similar to this in that regard. Nevertheless, in the next report we expect to have some interesting news about the installer self-update functionality and about the LVM support in the new storage stack. Stay tuned.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><a href="https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC16">openSUSE Conference&#8217;16</a>, <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com">Hackweek 14</a> and the various SUSE internal workshops are over. So it&#8217;s time for the YaST team to go back to usual three-weeks-long development sprints&#8230; and with new sprints come new public reports!  </p>
<p>With Leap 42.2 in Alpha phase and SLE12-SP2 in Beta phase our focus is on bugs fixing, so we don&#8217;t have as much fancy stuff to show in this report. Still, here you are some bits you could find interesting.</p>
<h3>Installer memory consumption reduced</h3>
<p>For our SLE customers we promise installations on machines with as little as 512MB of RAM. For Tumbleweed, 1GB is required &#8211; so the situation is more relaxed there.</p>
<p>But look at the total size of filesystem images that must be kept in memory during installation: 176MB for SLE12 (Tumbleweed: 224MB). This is leaving not much room to run programs.</p>
<p>The size has grown considerably over time, and we had to look for places to save space. We came up with some major areas for improvement.</p>
<p>The initrd and the installation system (the file system image containing the installer) share many files (mainly libraries). By removing any overlap, we were able to reduce the image size by 17MB for SLE12 (Tumbleweed: 30MB).</p>
<p>After the package installation starts, kernel modules and some raw libzypp cache data are no longer needed. By deleting zypp data we save another 3MB and kernel modules occupy even 29MB in SLE12 (Tumbleweed: 50MB). But we do this only on systems with less than 1GB memory.</p>
<p>So, compared to the available 512MB, these savings are quite substantial and will hopefully keep us going for a while&#8230;</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: another step to an installable system</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s time for our reimplementation of the storage layer to prove it can do the real work. Thus, we have integrated the new code in a set of <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/storage-ng/images/iso/">modified Tumbleweed ISO images</a> automatically generated in OBS. They cannot still be used to install a system, but the installer is already able to boot and reach the language selection screen (the first milestone we were aiming for).</p>
<p>We already had code that works in a simulated test environment (unit tests) and now we have a way to use that code in a real installer. Stay tuned for exciting news!</p>
<h3>Make many extensions fit on the screen properly</h3>
<p>For SUSE Linux Enterprise we offer so many optional modules that their listing did not fit on lower resolution screens. Below you can see how the screen looked before the fix &#8211; checkbox widgets and their labels do not fit so their bottoms are cropped.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bcropped.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bcropped-300x225.png" alt="Old interface with cropped extensions" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11895" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bcropped-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bcropped-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bcropped.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>We have to make sure YaST works across different interfaces, including text-based ncurses. That limits the set of widgets we can use when designing interfaces, so finding a solution to that kind of problems is not always easy. We also took the opportunity to add a filter for beta extensions, as you can see in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bfiltered.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bfiltered-300x225.png" alt="The beta extensions filter in action" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11896" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bfiltered-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bfiltered-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bfiltered.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>And finally you can see how it looks like with all the extensions, including beta ones. Instead of cropping elements we now have a scroll-bar in the right.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bmodules.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bmodules-300x225.png" alt="The new extensions UI in all its glory" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11897" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bmodules-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bmodules-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bmodules.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: LVM unit testing</h3>
<p>The next step in the storage layer reimplementation is adding support for LVM, since right now only regular partitions are supported. We always write a lot of unit tests to make sure the different pieces work in isolation before integrating everything together into the installer. During this sprint we created all the infrastructure for testing LVM at such level. Armed with that, we can start writing reliable code to handle LVM (something we have already started to do).</p>
<h3>Improved patterns handling for system roles</h3>
<p>We recently introduced the concept of system roles during installation. The chosen role affects the selection of package patterns. But we realized that the roles were not completely overriding the default selection of packages. Before the fix introduced in this sprint, desktop related patterns were included  for a <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-installation/wiki/System-Role">KVM server role</a> and, thus, the systemd target was graphical.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bbadrole.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bbadrole-300x234.png" alt="The KVM Server role before the fix" width="300" height="234" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11902" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bbadrole-300x234.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bbadrole-768x599.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bbadrole.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Now, only the 3 patterns explicitly intended for the KVM role are selected, with no desktop related patterns. Accordingly, the system boots to text mode.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bgoodrole.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bgoodrole-300x234.png" alt="Fixed KVM Server role" width="300" height="234" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11903" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bgoodrole-300x234.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bgoodrole-768x599.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bgoodrole.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: the future of booting</h3>
<p>We have explained in several previous posts how we are collaborating with Grub and hardware architecture experts to make sure the new storage layer makes always sensible partitioning proposals. For that purpose <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> has proven to be an excellent tool. It does not only allow us to have full unit test coverage or our code, but also the generated output has become the perfect base to discuss the expected behavior of the system in every possible scenario.</p>
<p>During this sprint, we spent quite some time together with SUSE&#8217;s Grub genius Michael Chang defining the best possible partitioning schema in x86 architectures. Once we had a human-readable and non-ambiguous specification, we modified our code to make sure the associated RSpec tests generated exactly the <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng/blob/master/doc/boot-requirements.md">same specification</a> as output. This way we make sure that our code works and that it fits 100% the experts expectations.</p>
<p>Kudos to Michael for his infinite patience with our questions and for coming up with an innovative way of using Grub2 that will allow us to boot in many tricky scenarios, eliminating the need of introducing a separate <code>/boot</code> in almost all cases.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>As said, most of the sprint was invested in chasing bugs&#8230; and we don&#8217;t expect next sprint to be different in that regard. Even though, we hope this post to contain enough new stuff to keep you entertained and informed about what is going on in the YaST trenches.</p>
<p>See you in three weeks!</p>

            <h3 id="installation-video-mode">Installation Video Mode</h3>
<p>If you need to make screenshots of the installation it is useful to influence their size. You could press <code>F3</code> in the boot menu and choose from a menu, but that is not well suited for scripts such as openQA.</p>
<p>The installer now obeys an <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Linuxrc#p_xvideo">option</a> from the boot command line: <code>xvideo</code>.</p>
<pre><code>xvideo=[WIDTHxHEIGHT][,DPI]
xvideo=1024x768
xvideo=1024x768,100
xvideo=,100</code></pre>

<h3 id="how-to-install-with-a-self-signed-certificate">How to Install with a Self-Signed Certificate</h3>
<p>You can now install from a repository served with HTTPS that has a self-signed certificate. Use a <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Linuxrc#p_sslcerts"><code>ssl_certs=0</code> boot option</a>.</p>
<p><small>(Available in yast2-packager-3.1.104. <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=982727">bsc#982727</a>)</small></p>
<h3 id="installation-local-smt-servers-are-pre-filled">Installation: Local SMT Servers are Pre-filled</h3>
<p>Last sprint (<a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/06/07/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-20/">S#20</a>) we improved the registration UI. Now we&#8217;ve made one more improvement: pre-filling the <em>Register System via local SMT Server</em> field.</p>
<p>Before, the widget was a single text field and a little helpful <code>smt.example.com</code> was always shown (no matter what your actual domain was). <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/102056/16152080/50519e9e-34a0-11e6-93f1-6402aa1be0d4.png" alt="local-smt-server-1-before" /></p>
<p>Now, if your local <a href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/smt11/">SMT</a> servers are advertised via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Location_Protocol">SLP</a> they will be offered as choices. (Here <code>acme.com</code> stands for your domain) <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/102056/16152092/58652218-34a0-11e6-9754-a4181ec2ea20.png" alt="local-smt-server-2-after" /></p>
<p><small>(Available in yast2-registration-3.1.176. <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=981633">bsc#981633</a>.)</small></p>
<h3 id="new-storage-iso">New Storage: ISO</h3>
<p>We have started building an <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/storage-ng/images">installation ISO image</a> with the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/YaST:storage-ng">new storage library</a>. The first build contains all the pieces but they don&#8217;t work together yet.</p>
<h3 id="new-storage-boot-scenarios">New Storage: Boot Scenarios</h3>
<p>We have documented the <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng/blob/master/doc/boot-requirements.md">supported scenarios</a> regarding booting in the new storage layer.</p>
<p><small>(Tooling note: We made this with a <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng/blob/master/src/tools/md_formatter.rb">Markdown formatter for RSpec</a> invoked <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng/blob/master/rakelib/doc_bootspecs.rake">like this</a>.)</small></p>
<h3 id="network-settings-are-less-eager-to-restart">Network Settings are Less Eager to Restart</h3>
<p>If you opened Network Settings to review something, made no changes, and closed the dialog with OK, the network would be restarted. That may be undesirable if you have an Important Application running. We originally thought that everyone would close the dialog with Cancel, but we were proven wrong.</p>
<p>Now the module properly checks whether you have made changes to the settings, and omits the restart if appropriate.</p>
<p><small>(Available in yast2-network-3.1.155. <a href="https://fate.suse.com/318787">FATE#318787</a>)</small></p>
<h3 id="network-in-autoyast">Network in AutoYaST</h3>
<p>Due to a problem in the AutoYaST version shipped with SLE 12 SP1 and openSUSE Leap 42.1, the network configuration used during the first stage was always copied to the installed system regardless the value of <code>keep_install_network</code>.</p>
<p>Upcoming SLE 12 SP2 and Leap 42.2 behaves as expected and <code>keep_install_network</code> will be set to <code>true</code> by default.</p>
<p><small>(Available in yast2-network-3.1.157 + autoyast2-3.1.133. Fixes <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=984146">bsc#984146</a>.)</small></p>
