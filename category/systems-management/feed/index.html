				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For quite some time we had a package named ec2-api-tools in the Cloud:EC2 project and I suspect many that work with EC2 had found the package and were using the ec2-* commands to manage stuff in EC2. Along with the ec2-api-tools Amazon maintained a separate ec2-* tool set for various services. Keeping up with the armada of Amazon developers is not easy and thus the other ec2-* tool sets never got packaged.</p>
<p>Now a new integrated set of tools is available called with the &#8220;aws&#8221; command and provided by the aws-cli package. The package is available from the Cloud:Tools project and a submit request to Factory is pending. The new package does not obsolete the ec2-api-tools package as there is no issue with having both packages installed. However, I did take the liberty to remove the ec2-api-tool package from the Cloud:EC2 project as it would no longer receive updates considering that we have a nice new tool that unifies all Amazon services. The documentation for the new command can be found <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cli/" title="here"></a>.</p>
<p>The aws code is hosted on github and thus contribution of fixes is easy and that is another big plus over the ec2-* tool sets.</p>
<p>Yes, and of course we need to get openSUSE 13.1 into EC2, and I am working on that, stay tuned&#8230;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The x86_64 edition of openSUSE Education&#8217;s <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e" title="Li-f-e">Li-f-e</a> live DVD supports PXE booting the iso over the network, here is how to do it:</p>
<p>* Install Li-f-e (Switch to GRUB from Installation Summary page if your hardware does not support EFI boot ), make sure you have plenty of space assigned to / partition(about 20G)<br />
* Set up LTSP by following this <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:LTSP%20quick%20start%2012.2%20Edu" title="LTSP Quick Start">quick start guide</a><br />
* Create /srv/nfs folder and copy Li-f-e iso there<br />
* Run the following as root in terminal:<br />
<code><br />
mount /srv/nfs/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e.x86_64-13.1.1.iso /mnt<br />
cp /mnt/boot/x86_64/loader/linux /srv/tftpboot/boot/linux-life64<br />
cp /mnt/boot/x86_64/loader/initrd /srv/tftpboot/boot/initrd-life64<br />
echo "/srv/nfs *(ro,no_root_squash,async,no_subtree_check)" &gt;&gt; /etc/exports<br />
cat &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt; /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default<br />
LABEL Li-f-e<br />
kernel boot/linux-life64<br />
append initrd=boot/initrd-life64 isofrom_device=nfs:10.0.0.254:/srv/nfs/ isofrom_system=/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e.x86_64-13.1.1.iso nonm<br />
IPAPPEND 2<br />
EOF<br />
chkconfig rpcbind on &amp;&amp; service rpcbind restart<br />
chkconfig nfsserver on &amp;&amp; service nfsserver restart<br />
</code><br />
Now you can PXE boot any machine over the network, select Li-f-e from the end of the boot menu to boot live DVD iso instead of normal LTSP session.</p>
<p>Please note that if you install Li-f-e booted over the network then after the installation  you will need to remove &#8220;nonm&#8221; boot option using yast2 bootloader to get NetworkManager working again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YaST switched to the GPL license back in 2004, but there were still a lot of obstacles to easy contributions to the project. There was a bunch of changes in the past to improve contribution to the project, like switching from the openSUSE subversion server to <a href="http://github.com/yast" title="GitHub">GitHub</a>, generating documentation to doc.opensuse.org or having public IRC. But we are not satisfied and do even more steps to make it easy to contribute to YaST.<br />
<span id="more-10277"></span><br /> The most visible action in the last year was the conversion from YCP to Ruby. We found that having a special language just for YaST made some sense in the past, but now becomes useless and makes obstacles for newcomers which must at first learn a language before they can change anything. Ruby is a well known language with a nice ecosystem around including benchmarking, profiling, debugging or testing frameworks. The latest mentioned testing framework is quite important, because good test coverage allows reducing of fear from changes. For tests we chose the well known framework <a href="http://rspec.info/" target="_blank">RSpec</a>, so people coming from the Ruby world know it and others find it intuitive.</p>
<p>Related to tests are also continuous integration that tests code after each code change and automatically sends new packages to the devel project and to Factory if needed. We make our CI node publicly visible on the <a href="http://ci.opensuse.org/view/Yast" title="openSUSE CI server" target="_blank">openSUSE CI server</a>, so everyone can see if build succeeded and what is the reason if it failed.</p>
<p>We also decided to help newcomers with a quick introductory <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:YaST_development" title="documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a>. One page recently updated to reflect the current state is about <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:YaST:_Code_Organization" target="_blank">code organization</a> which helps newcomers to orient in current YaST modules. The content is a bit terse and a minority of pages links to some old tutorials and documentation, but we take care to quickly react to questions and suggestions.
</p>
<p>Another change is deletion of the internal YaST IRC channel and now all communication happens on the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23yast" target="_blank">#yast</a> Freenode channel. This change really increases the chance that you catch YaST developers on IRC. Others ways are the <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/" target="_blank">YaST mailing list</a>, <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Report_a_YaST_bug" target="_blank">Bugzilla</a>, <a href="https://github.com/organizations/yast" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://features.opensuse.org/" target="_blank">openSUSE feature tracker</a>.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s start hacking YaST and if you find any obstacle, contact us, so we can remove it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I try to explain in this series of blog entries how to install gcc (GNU C-Compiler) and what to do with it. I  also try to explain little make and CMake/Autotools. This is not very generic tutorial because I like to promote openSUSE as coding platform. Most of the tips goes just fine with every distro. For the first words I like to say one thing: openSUSE is excellent platform for C-coding. Though, you can choose your programming language  but this time I like to talk about GCC and specially C-Compiler. I&#8217;ll try to how to get there with these writings because I have noticed that this substance is getting less attention that it needs. Also noted that <a title="the GNU Compiler Collection" href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> anf <a title="https://www.gnu.org/gnu30/" href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu30/" target="_blank">GNU is 30 years</a> and I have used it almost 15 so time to share some information.<span id="more-9978"></span></p>
<h2>openSUSE and Linux</h2>
<p>This is for first timers with openSUSE and GCC not people who know how to use YaST and openSUSE. If you understand <em>openSUSE is Linux-kernel based <a title="Redhat Package Manager" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager" target="_blank">RPM</a> application distribution in common language openSUSE is Linux operating system</em> you shouldn&#8217;t be reading this it&#8217;s just waste of your time. If you are still reading you should understand  in deep openSUSE is GNU/Linux based operating system but let&#8217;s not get in to that battle.<br />
So One can think Google Android as Google/Linux distribution (It&#8217;s also Linux say what you want). They took some tools from normal Linux distributions (there are common tools like GCC) and made rest from the scratch. Is it better or worst you have to choose that from you point of view.<br />
If you come from BSD world for example Mac OS X or FreeBSD and have done some object-C or C (with or without command-line) you don&#8217;t have to forget everything just keep your mind open. If you popped just from Microsoft Windows world thought &#8216;hey I&#8217;ll start developing Linux/Android/Cross-platform apps.&#8217; you REALLY have to keep you mind open. Hey I was on Windows decade a go and I&#8217;m still alive in Linux world in base Microsoft Windows is <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX" target="_blank">POSIX</a> standard compliant like Linux.</p>
<h2>Command-line (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h2>
<p>All I&#8217;ll cover in these blog posts are Command-line examples. If you want to use IDE (Eclipse or such) go a head but I&#8217;ll like one to understand how everything really works. You don&#8217;t have to dream like those machines about cosmic <a title="Electric sheep" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Sheep" target="_blank">electric sheeps</a> to understand command-line. You can get there also in Microsoft Windows world and you don&#8217;t have to ever get there in Linux if you don&#8217;t want to. I&#8217;ll just feel little bit safer if you or me understand how to install and compile applications on Linux with command line. <a title="CLI" href="http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/command_line_intro" target="_blank">I won&#8217;t explain to you what is command-line</a> (CLI) and<a title="Tips" href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/" target="_blank"> how to get there from GUI (Graphical User Interface)</a> where you probably are reading this from you browser please surf to read the <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface" target="_blank">Wikipedia article about it</a>. If you didn&#8217;t understand anything what I just said you can blame me and take a break.</p>
<h2>Install GCC on openSUSE</h2>
<p>I assume that you have installed <a title="Download openSUSE" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface" target="_blank">openSUSE</a>. If not download and install version that have GUI. Do it if you aren&#8217;t PRO or have some very very very very good reason (<a title="Install on Virtualbox" href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:VirtualBox_Installation" target="_blank">like running it on virtual machine</a> top of Windows then <a title="VMWare" href="http://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank">VMWare</a> and <a title="Oracle Virtualbox" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtualbox</a> are you way to go. <a title="QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer" href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">Qemu</a> works but you have be again very open minded).<br />
But now you have running openSUSE system with nice <a title="KDE" href="http://www.kde.org/" target="_blank">KDE</a>/<a title="Gnome" href="http://www.gnome.org/" target="_blank">Gnome</a>/<a title="Xfce" href="http://www.xfce.org/" target="_blank">XFCE4</a>/<a title="LXDE" href="http://lxde.org/" target="_blank">LXDE</a> GUI look and If you were hacker you installed all you needed stuff when you installed openSUSE to hard drive. If you like me and didn&#8217;t keep reading. In openSUSE you can manage everything with <a title="YaST is the installation and configuration tool for openSUSE" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:YaST" target="_blank">YaST</a> or you can choose the <span style="color: #ff0000">red pill</span> and see the true world.</p>
<h2>YaST way</h2>
<p>open YaST from application menu. You find it there just look for <img alt="Yast2" src="http://en.opensuse.org/images/thumb/f/f8/Icon-yast.png/128px-Icon-yast.png" width="32" height="32" />Logo under<strong> settings</strong>. Type in root password. Choose &#8216;<em>Software Managemen</em>t&#8217;. Now you can just type &#8216;gcc&#8217; in &#8216;<em>Find:</em>&#8216; box. I&#8217;ll just assume you install &#8216;<em>gcc</em>&#8216; by clicking box (there comes green right mark) front of it and then push Apply. It&#8217;s easy as that. Now you have C-compiler (no C++ or ADA) but no auto-tools or make (or Cmake/Scons).</p>
<p>If you are on CLI you see <a title="New Curses" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses" target="_blank">NCurses</a> based YaST:</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/gcc-blog1.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-9987" alt="gcc-blog1" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/gcc-blog1-300x178.png" width="300" height="178" /></a> <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/gcc-blog2.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-9988" alt="gcc-blog2" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/gcc-blog2-300x176.png" width="300" height="176" /></a></p>
<h2>pure CLI way without YaST</h2>
<p>Go to CLI (<a title="KDE Konsole" href="http://konsole.kde.org/">Konsole</a>/<a title="Gnome Terminal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal">Gnome-terminal</a>/<a title="Xorg Xterm" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm">xterm</a> or in to real CLI). You have to be use &#8216;root&#8217; or have sudo rights to do any wizardry that is explained here. So I assume you just are root just type</p>
<pre>zypper install gcc</pre>
<p>and answer &#8216;y&#8217; after it asks. It does the same as YaST.</p>
<p>That is that for first blog. If everything went right Now you have Gnu C-Compiler available. next time I&#8217;ll explain what you can do with it.</p>
<pre>Disclaimer: All the stuff here are my own opinions not openSUSE nor Linux community. I'm have used openSUSE or SuSE something over 10 years. I have made <a title="Ilmi Solutions Oy" href="http://ilmi.fi" target="_blank">professionally</a> many years of development with openSUSE so I know somethings but I don't know everything and I just try to get you along.</pre>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a new tool that provides a simple zenity based GUI frontend to <a title="live-fat-stick" href="https://github.com/cyberorg/live-fat-stick">live-fat-stick</a> script. The <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2012/09/13/live-fat-stick/">live-fat-stick</a> script allows you to create multi boot USB stick/HDD which has vfat partition on it without formatting or removing existing data on it, it uses whole ISO images to boot so the image is still usable to create more live USB sticks or burn CD/DVDs. In live mode the device&#8217;s vfat partition can be mounted to access/modify and save files.</p>
<p>Currently live CD/DVD isos of openSUSE 12.2(and derivatives) including all from <a href="http://susestudio.com">susestudio</a>, Mint, Ubuntu(and derivatives) and Fedora are supported. Fedora iso is not copied but is extracted on the USB device instead as it does not support booting from iso image yet.</p>
<p>Here is Live USB GUI in action:<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you want to play with cloud software on your own machines?<br />
Some people have been working to package the current OpenStack version &#8220;Folsom&#8221; for openSUSE (tested on 12.2) and add scripts to configure it into a working state.<br />
You need 2GB of RAM and 3+ GB of free disk space under /var/lib/<br />
Then you do</p>
<p><code> wget https://raw.github.com/SUSE-Cloud/automation/master/scripts/jenkins/qa_openstack.sh<br />
export cloudsource=openstackfolsom ; bash -x qa_openstack.sh<br />
</code></p>
<p>This is a script we use for continous integration testing, but it is as useful to setup a simple environment for development, testing or demoing.<br />
Folsom packages are still rather rough and might see some change over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>If you want the older stable version, you can use the above snippet with cloudsource=openstackessex<br />
however, there are some known bugs in that old version and backports are really hard.</p>
<p>Soon there will be Grizzly packages upcoming. More is to come&#8230;</p>
<p><i>P.S. To interact with your cloud, you need credentials, which are automatically sourced from /etc/bash.bashrc.local (it is admin:openstack) and then you use commands like<br />
<code>nova list</code> and <code>glance image-list</code><br />
but there is also a web-interface that allows you to do most actions in a browser &#8211; even VNC, if you use KVM instead of the default lxc.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the release of <a href="http://snapper.io">snapper</a> 0.1.0 also non-root users are able to manage snapshots. On the technical side this is achieved by splitting snapper into a client and server that communicate via <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus">D-Bus</a>. As a user you should not notice any difference.</p>
<p>So how can you make use of it? Suppose the subvolume /home/tux is already configured for snapper and you want to allow the user tux to manage the snapshots for her home directory. This is done in two easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit /etc/snapper/configs/home-tux and add ALLOW_USERS=&#8221;tux&#8221;. Currently the server snapperd does not reload the configuration so if it&#8217;s running either kill it or wait for it to terminate by itself.</li>
<li>Give the user permissions to read and access the .snapshots directory, &#8216;chmod a+rx /home/tux/.snapshots&#8217;.</li>
</ol>
<p>For details consult the snapper man-page.</p>
<p>Now tux can play with snapper:</p>
<pre>
  tux&gt; alias snapper="snapper -c home-tux"

  tux&gt; snapper create --description test

  tux&gt; snapper list
  Type   | # | Pre # | Date                             | User | Cleanup  | Description | Userdata
  -------+---+-------+----------------------------------+------+----------+-------------+---------
  single | 0 |       |                                  | root |          | current     |         
  single | 1 |       | Tue 16 Oct 2012 12:15:01 PM CEST | root | timeline | timeline    |         
  single | 2 |       | Tue 16 Oct 2012 12:21:38 PM CEST | tux  |          | test        |
</pre>
<p>Snapper packages are available for various distributions in the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project%3Dfilesystems%3Asnapper">filesystems:snapper</a> project.</p>
<p>So long and see you at the <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/">openSUSE Conference</a> 2012 in Prague.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, came across <a title="x2go home" href="http://x2go.org">x2go</a> packages maintained by<a title="People of openSUSE" href="http://news.opensuse.org/2009/04/23/people-of-opensuse-jan-engelhardt/"> Jan Engelhardt</a> for openSUSE and other distributions on <a title="X11:RemoteDesktop:x2go" href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=X11:RemoteDesktop:x2go">open build service</a>. As <a title="Li-f-e" href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">openSUSE Education Li-f-e</a> has great <a title="LTSP home" href="http://ltsp.org">LTSP</a> integration thanks to<a title="KIWI-LTSP on openSUSE wiki" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI-LTSP"> KIWI-LTSP</a>, I decided to check out how x2go can fit in with this existing thin-client computing solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;x2go is an open (<acronym title="GNU General Public License">GPL</acronym>/AGPL) source “server based computing” project. Combining the advantages of existing systems it features ease of use, performance and scalability. x2go provides you with access to your desktop &#8211; from within your own network and via the internet. x2go is not limited to particular hardware, it supports a variety of devices and architectures.&#8221; -from their website.</p>
<p>Some of the features/benefits of x2go that are not available on LTSP are:</p>
<p>* Remote login from within local lan and internet from any OS<br />
* Session persistence, you can disconnect session from one client and continue where you left off from any other client<br />
* Low bandwidth usage<br />
* Session sharing with other users<br />
<span id="more-9029"></span><br />
Apart from these, x2go also supports sound redirection via pulseaudio, folder sharing for access to local disks similar to LTSP.</p>
<p>I would personally still prefer LTSP session in local network, and as x2goserver and LTSP server can coexist on same server we can choose x2goclient to connect over the internet and log in using LTSP in local lan.</p>
<p>Here is how to run x2go as kiosk session by PXE booting a thin-client/PC/laptop.</p>
<p>* Install <a title="kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go" href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go">kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go</a> on openSUSE Edu Li-f-e or 12.2 via <a title="Install via 1-click" href="http://software.opensuse.org/ymp/server:ltsp/openSUSE_12.2/kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go.ymp">1-click from here</a>.<br />
* Run <code>kiwi-ltsp -ln openSUSE_12_2_x2go</code> as root to create KIWI-LTSP image that is used for PXE booting clients, (this step requires fast internet connection and about 250M download)<br />
* Run <code>kiwi-ltsp -c</code> to configure required services<br />
* Add the following to<strong><em> /srv/tftpboot/KIWI/root.default/etc/lts.conf</strong></em>  under [default] for all clients or under [MA:CA:DD:RE:SS] for a particular client and boot up the client, openSUSE_12_2_x2go will be available at the end of boot menu.<br />
<code><br />
        SCREEN_07=kiosk<br />
        KIOSK_EXE="/usr/bin/x2goclient --no-menu --maximize --link=lan --geometry=fullscreen --thinclient --haltbt --no-session-edit  --add-to-known-hosts"<br />
        KIOSKUSER=x2goclient<br />
 </code></p>
<p>You can also have normal LTSP session on tty8 along with this by adding <code>SCREEN_08=ldm</code>. To connect to the server from non-thin-client install and run x2goclient.</p>
<p>You can simply poweroff the client without the need to disconnect or do normal shutdown.</p>
<p>Note: this method of using x2go is just for testing and development purpose, you can use x2goserver and x2goclient in a standalone mode without kiwi-ltsp bits. Nothing additional than installing x2goserver package is needed to setup the server, except firewall should allow access to ssh port(22). </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After some iterations of updating the system with zypper dup or yast and some years of service with the system you will find out that there is a lot of dust which is obsolete or has been forgotten. Recently I had the problem that I need to move my 32bit system to a 64bit system and thus the way to go was to migrate the running system into an image description, build a 64bit image from it and install that on the 64bit machine. But the most important part was to cleanup the running system and find out what it really contains. The report kiwi migrate created here was helpful and so I think it might be helpful for others too. Just call:</p>
<blockquote><p>kiwi &#8211;migrate mySystem</p></blockquote>
<p>It will end up with some data below /tmp/mySystem which of course can be removed at any time without any risk. Most interesting is the html report generated which you can view with any browser. So far kiwi collects the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>kernel version and kernel specific kmp packages</li>
<li>hardware dependent packages</li>
<li>installed gem packages</li>
<li>repository checkouts</li>
<li>rpm packages installed multiple times</li>
<li>rpm packages which could not be found according to the current repo setup including version and repo information</li>
<li>tree of modified files, packaged but changed</li>
<li>tree of custom files, those which doesn&#8217;t belong to any package or other part of the bullet list</li>
</ul>
<p>basically the use case of kiwi migrate is to migrate the running system into an appliance description but I&#8217;m not there yet. There is still room for improvement but I think it still can help to cleanup the system and to see what is installed on the system and not managed by a package manager</p>
<p>I have tested this since openSUSE 11.4</p>
<p>Remember to have fun <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
