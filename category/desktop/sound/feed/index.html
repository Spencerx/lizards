				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m testing PulseAudio 3.0 on openSUSE 12.3 RC1 and it might be helpful to hang this information out here where Google can find it:</p>
<p>To use Skype with openSUSE 12.3, you need to download the Skype package for openSUSE.  If you&#8217;re using a 64 bit machine/install, like most of us nowadays, you also need some 32 bit compatibility packages, included with openSUSE.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download Skype from <a href="http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-linux/">http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-linux/</a></li>
<li>Select openSUSE 12.1 32 bit (the most recent openSUSE version for which they offer Skype at time of writing) and save the package</li>
<li>As root,<br />
<blockquote><p>zypper in skype-4.1.0.20-suse.i586.rpm alsa-plugins-pulse-32bit</p></blockquote>
<p>to install the package, its 32 bit requirements, and the 32 bit ALSA plugin for PulseAudio it also needs, but doesn&#8217;t/can&#8217;t specify automatically.</li>
</ol>
<p>Happy calling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometime ago Gabriel asked me if I could give him help with the Banshee repositories for openSUSE; This repositories have many users hanging around and some packages are enabled on other projects, which makes them somehow sensible to deep changes.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;ve pushed to openSUSE:Factory Banshee 2.0.1 (latest stable release) and a few packages which live in the Banshee repository. I&#8217;ve also submitted a deletion request to ipod-sharp which is no longer maintained and was replaced in the past for libgpod.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve fixed the pending issues I&#8217;ve seen on the Banshee repository and Banshee 2.0.1 and disabled SLE 11 builds (not requiring all the dependencies). The repository serves now the following platforms (banshee and banshee-community-extensions):<br />
* SLE 11 SP1;<br />
* openSUSE 11.3;<br />
* openSUSE 11.4;<br />
* openSUSE Factory;<br />
* openSUSE Tumbleweed (new).</p>
<p>On Banshee:Unstable (which should hold the unstable releases, currently 2.1.0) I&#8217;ll be introducing some changes during the next days which will feature:<br />
* Package being renamed to &#8216;banshee&#8217;, thus dropping the current banshee-1;<br />
* Migration to pkgconfig() calls for &gt;= 1130;<br />
* Packages banshee and banshee-core get merged into banshee (currently banshee had only 4 documentation files);<br />
*  New sub-package banshee-common to hold all the architecture independent files (ex: text files, icons, etc);<br />
* A few cleanups on the spec file for unsupported platforms (SLE11 and SLE11SP1 do not meet the requirements for this version and superior).</p>
<p>Once this is implemented and tested I will look into Banshee:Alpha and see the best way to start building daily/weekly snapshots using the OBS magic available and some magic tricks hidden in Dimstar&#8217;s sleeve which kindly accepted my request to give me a hand on such evil task.</p>
<p>In the future, on the next stable release (2.2.0), I&#8217;ll move the changes from Banshee:Unstable to Banshee and hopefully change the development repository to Banshee (as if Factory has the latest stable release it makes no sense in having Banshee&#8217;s development repository in Banshee:Unstable) and synch all at once.</p>
<p>Users subscribed to Banshee:Unstable repository might see some turbulence during the next days, while users subscribing now through the 1-Click installer will already be installing Banshee with the changes described above.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I tried to start <a href="http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/">supertuxkart</a>, the marvelous race game, in openSUSE_11.2 (x86_64 if that matters) but it failed with the following error:</p>
<p><code>$ supertuxkart<br />
Data files will be fetched from: '/usr/share/games/supertuxkart/'<br />
AL lib: pulseaudio.c:382: Context did not get ready: Connection refused</code></p>
<p>The problem is a configuration setting in <strong>/etc/openal/alsoft.conf</strong>.  Just uncomment the drivers line and remove <strong>pulse</strong> from the <strong>drivers</strong> line in that file and supertuxkart starts to work again.</p>
<p>It can be easily tested with the command <strong>openal-info</strong>.  Before the change one get the error message shown above, and after one gets useful information.</p>
<p>I got this problem solved, due to a <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=205449&amp;page=170">discussion on the ubuntu forums</a>.  Thank you guys.</p>
<p>Hopefully this short note is useful for someone.</p>
<p>Update (16 Feb 2010): just today openal was updated from version 1.10 to 1.11 and with the new version supertuxkart started without problems <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
