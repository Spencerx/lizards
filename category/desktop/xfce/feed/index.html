				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we announced in <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12263">the previous report</a>, our 31th Scrum sprint was slightly shorter than the usual ones. But you would never say so looking to this blog post. We have a lot of things to talk you about!</p>
<h3>Teaching the installer self-update to be a better citizen</h3>
<p>As you may know, YaST includes a <a href="https://fate.suse.com/319716">nice feature</a> which allows the installer to update itself in order to solve bugs in the installation media. This mechanism has been included in SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SP2, although it&#8217;s not enabled by default (you need to pass an extra option <code>selfupdate=1</code> to make it work).</p>
<p>So after getting some feedback, we&#8217;re working toward fixing some usability problems. The first of them is that, in some situations, the self-update mechanism is too intrusive.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario: you&#8217;re installing a system behind a firewall which prevents the machine to connect to the outside network. As the SUSE Customer Center will be unreachable, YaST complains about not being able to get the list of repositories for the self-update. And, after that, you get another complain because the fallback repository is not accessible. Two error messages and 2 timeouts.</p>
<p>And the situation could be even worse if you don&#8217;t have access to a DNS server (add another error message).</p>
<p>So after some discussion we&#8217;ve decided to show such errors only if the user has specified SMT or a custom self-update repository (which is also possible). In any other case, the error is logged and the self-update is skipped completely.</p>
<p>You can find further information in our <a href="https://gist.github.com/imobachgs/cb03b6a87dd5e31c89a9463d30db4252">Self-Update Use Cases and Error Handling document</a>.</p>
<p>During upcoming sprints, we&#8217;ll keep working on making the self-update feature great!</p>
<h3>Configuring workers during CaaSP installation</h3>
<p>While CaaSP release approaches, our team is still working hard to satisfy the new requirements. Thankfully, YaST is a pretty flexible tool and it allows us to change a lot of things.</p>
<p>For CaaSP installation, YaST features a one-dialog installation screen. During this sprint, configuration of the <code>Worker</code> role has been implemented, including validation of the entered URL and writing the value to the installed system. You can check the animated screenshot for details.</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/worker.gif" alt="The CaaSP worker configuration" /></p>
<h3>New desktop selection screen in openSUSE installer</h3>
<p>The world of Linux desktop environments change relatively quick, with new options popping-up and some projects being abandoned. Thanks to the openSUSE&#8217;s community of packagers we have a lot of these new desktop environments available on the openSUSE distributions. But the status of those packages for openSUSE is also subject to changes: some desktop environments are poorly maintained while others have a strong and active group of packagers and maintainer behind.</p>
<p>The YaST Team does not have enough overview and time to watch all these desktop environment and evaluate which one is ready or not for being in the installer&#8217;s desktop selection screen. So the openSUSE Release Team decided to replace this dialog with something a bit more generic but still useful for newcomers.</p>
<p>They asked the YaST Team to come up with a new dialog featuring the two openSUSE main desktops (KDE Plasma and GNOME) and allowing the easy selection of other environments without reworking the dialog in the future. The goal of that new dialog was to replace the existing one you can see in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop-300x226.png" alt="The old desktop selection screen" width="300" height="226" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12312" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop-300x226.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop-768x579.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop.png 1023w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>We decided the new dialog should rely on patterns for several reasons. The main one is that the set of patterns is under the close control of the openSUSE community, which looks more closely than us to the desktop environments and their integration into the distribution. Moreover, each pattern specifies its own icon and description that can be somehow re-used by the installer.</p>
<p>We also took the opportunity to merge this almost empty and outdated dialog with the new one.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos-300x226.png" alt="The old additional repositories screen" width="300" height="226" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12313" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos-300x226.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos-768x578.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos-1024x770.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos.png 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Addons are no longer produced for openSUSE, so only the second checkbox made any sense nowadays. Moreover, the functionality of that second checkbox directly influence the available selection of patterns, so it made more sense to merge everything in a single screen that keeping an extra step in the installation just to accommodate a checkbox.</p>
<p>So we sent a proposal for the new dialog to the opensuse-factory mailing list and, after implementing many of the ideas discussed there (like better wording or using a button instead of a checkbox for the online repositories), this is the new dialog that replaces the two ones mentioned above.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop-300x225.png" alt="The new desktop selection dialog" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12315" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop-768x577.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Selecting &#8220;custom&#8221; will take the users to the already existing patterns selection screen. Just in case you don&#8217;t remember how that screen looks like, you can check this image.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns-300x225.png" alt="The patterns selection screen" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12316" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns-1024x768.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns.png 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>If these screenshots are not enough to make your mind about the change, you can check the following animation, in which KDE Plasma is initially chosen to be changed at a later point (going back in the workflow) to LXQt.</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/desktop_animation.gif" alt="Desktop selection animation" /></p>
<p>It will take some time before the changes hit the Tumbleweed installer, since they obviously have a non-trivial impact on the openQA tests, that will need some adaptation.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everybody that contributed to this new feature by providing feedback and suggestions through the mailing list. Once again, the openSUSE community has proved to be simply awesome!</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: improved handling of logical partitions</h3>
<p>Our reimplementation of the storage layer keeps getting improvements here and there. With the base x86 case working, we are now implementing the tricky parts, like the partitions renumbering that takes place when dealing with logical partitions in a MBR style partition table.</p>
<p>With GPT partition tables or with primary partitions in a MBR partition table, the partition gets a number (like sda1) when it&#8217;s created and keeps that number for its whole lifetime. But logical partition gets constantly renumbered when other partitions are created and destroyed. We need to know in advance what device name every partition will get in order to configure everything beforehand and only commit the changes to the disk when the user clicks in the &#8220;install&#8221; (during the installation process) or &#8220;commit&#8221; (if running the expert partitioner).</p>
<p>Now, libstorage-ng is able to simulate in memory the re-numbering process, so we can calculate all the settings related to partitioning (like the configuration of the bootloader) before really touching the disk.</p>
<h3>Making kdump work in CaaSP</h3>
<p>When you enable the Kernel Crash Dump (kdump), you probably expect that you will get a kind of core dump, like you do for regular processes. What you might not expect is an automatic reboot. That is a nice bonus. If you are tired of waiting for an <em>actual</em> kernel crash, you can test your kdump setup by triggering a crash yourself. Just run this as root:</p>
<pre>
echo c &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger</code>
</pre>
<p>The way kdump works is by allocating some extra memory at boot time and putting a second kernel+initrd there. When the main kernel realizes it is crashing, it transfers control (by kexec) to the other one, which has only one purpose, to dump the memory of the crashed kernel.</p>
<p>In the upcoming Containers as a Service Platform, kdump was not working because the root filesystem is read-only there and we were not able to create the kdump initrd. We <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-kdump/pull/73">fixed it</a> by creating it just after the RPMs are installed, when the FS is still read-write.</p>
<h3>Fixes for Snapper in CaaSP</h3>
<p>Kdump was not the only component affected by the fact of having a read-only filesystem in CaaSP. Snapper was also running into problems when trying to execute the <code>rollback</code> and <code>cleanup</code> operations. Now the problems are fixed. While working on that we did enough interesting findings to deserve a separate blog entry. So you can expect a new entry in the <a href="http://snapper.io/news.html">Snapper.io blog</a> soon.</p>
<h3>Snapshot-related improvements in the expert partitioner</h3>
<p>While we work on the new storage system, we are still taking care and improving the current one that will continue to be shipped with SLE12-SP3, SUSE CaaSP and openSUSE Leap 42.3. During this sprint we introduced a couple of usability improvements in the expert partitioner related to Btrfs subvolumes.</p>
<p>First of all, we moved the &#8220;Enable Snapshots&#8221; checkbox that was pretty much hidden in the &#8220;Subvolume Handling&#8221; dialog to the place where it really belongs &#8211; below the selector of the file-system type.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-300x187.png" alt="New location for enabling snapshots" width="300" height="187" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12327" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-300x187.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-768x478.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-1024x637.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots.png 1350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>In addition, we added the warning you can see in the screenshot below for users enabling snapshots in a potentially problematic setup.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning-300x186.png" alt="Warning for snapshots in a small partition" width="300" height="186" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12328" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning-300x186.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning-768x477.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning-1024x635.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning.png 1352w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Bring back the beta warning on CaaSP</h3>
<p>And talking about warnings, we improved the CaaSP installation dialog to show the Alpha/Beta product warning at the beginning. After changing the CaaSP installation to use the all-in-one dialog <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12263">described in our previous post</a>, this feature was lost as it is part of the initial EULA dialog. Now it is back and the users should now properly see the current product status.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning-300x225.png" alt="The CaaSP alpha/beta warning pop-up" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12305" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: encrypted LVM proposal</h3>
<p>Back to our storage layer reimplementation, the new system is now able to propose a setup with encrypted LVM. Since some sprints ago, we were already able to propose a partition-based and a LVM setup. That means the new proposal is now feature-pair with the old one, with the only exceptions of Btrfs sub-volumes (that shouldn&#8217;t be a big challenge) and s/390 storage (that is still not properly managed by the underlying libstorage-ng).</p>
<p>The bright part is that the new code is written with re-usability in mind, which means implementing an encrypted partition-based proposal (with no LVM) would be trivial. The new code is 100% covered by automatic unit tests and scores to the top in all the automatic quality checkers we have run (like Rubycritics, CodeClimate, and Rubocop).</p>
<p>So now we are prepared for whatever the future brings, having lost no single feature in the way.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: prototype if the UI for the proposal settings</h3>
<p>The next challenge is to make the power of that new storage proposal available to the users through the user interface. In the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12263">previous post</a> we presented the document describing the general ideas we wanted to discuss with UX experts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s our pleasure to announce we met the experts and we very easily reached an agreement on how the user interaction should be. During this sprint we already implemented a prototype of the future proposal settings wizard that is, as usual, included in our <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/storage-ng/images/iso/">testing ISO</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we have solid foundations, it&#8217;s very likely that the following sprint will result in the fully working wizard, with almost-final wording and design.</p>
<h3>Support for CaaSP added to the AutoYaST integration tests</h3>
<p>While fixing a problem with AutoYaST and CaaSP, we decided to extend our AutoYaST integration testing tool to support CaaSP. But, as a side effect, we also made some additional improvements that were long overdue (like improving the procedure to download ISOs, reducing timeouts, etc.).</p>
<p>Now, our internal Jenkins instance takes care of running AutoYaST integration tests for the development version of CaaSP (as it already does for SLE 12 SP2).</p>
<h3>Services manager moved to first auto-installation stage</h3>
<p>AutoYaST allows to <a href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/singlehtml/book_autoyast/book_autoyast.html#CreateProfile.Services">define a set of services</a> to be enabled/disabled in the installed system, applying this configuration during the 2nd stage (after the first reboot).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this approach won&#8217;t work for CaaSP because, in that case, the 2nd stage won&#8217;t be available. For that reason, during this sprint, we have adapted AutoYaST to write services configuration during 1st stage.</p>
<p>As usual, not only CaaSP, but other future (open)SUSE versions will benefit of this change.</p>
<h3>Faster YaST installation when the release notes cannot be downloaded</h3>
<p>Sometimes a very small simple change in a program makes a very noticeable impact in its everyday use. That&#8217;s the case of a fix implemented during this sprint. YaST usually re-tries to download the distribution release notes several times if the first attempt was unsuccessful. Although that&#8217;s correct from a general point of view, there are cases in which retrying makes no sense and only delays the installation. We have now added failed DNS resolution to that list of cases, which should result in a noticeable faster installation in many scenarios.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the case of AutoYaST we now skip downloading the release notes completely. Downloading them don&#8217;t make us much sense in the kind of unattended scenarios handled by AutoYaST and skipping this step and all the possible associated problems result in a more robust process.</p>
<h3>Better continuous integration for Libyui</h3>
<p>In the previous sprint we switched to Docker at Travis so we could build and test our packages in the native openSUSE system instead of the default Ubuntu. This sprint we did the same change also for the Libyui library which implements the UI part of YaST.</p>
<p>Originally we could not build the Libyui packages at Travis as either the required build dependencies were missing or were present at a very old unusable version. With this switch we can easily use the latest packages from openSUSE Tumbleweed and thus enable Travis builds for all Libyui packages.</p>
<h3>See you after Hack Week!</h3>
<p>As already mentioned, this week is <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/">Hack Week 15</a>! So our Scrum process will be on hold for some days. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the YaST development will stall. Since there are quite some YaST-related projects in the Hack Week page, you can expect YaST to simply go in unexpected directions. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>And remember Hack Week is not a SUSE internal initiative, we are open to collaboration from anybody within or outside the company. So jump in and have fun with us!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following up from my earlier post about <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2014/12/16/ltsp-client-goes-banana-pi/">openSUSE LTSP on Banana Pi</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102091635847832058268">Nora Lee</a> from the manufacturer of the board got in touch with me and sent me a couple of their new boards- <a href="http://www.bananapi.com/index.php/component/content/article?layout=edit&amp;id=73">Banana Pi M2,</a> runs on A31s quad-core CPU and has 1G RAM, powerful enough to run openSUSE Tumbleweed with Xfce Desktop.</p>
<p>Here is how you can get openSUSE running on Banana Pi M2.</p>
<p>* <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberorg-home/files/opensuse-arm/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.tar.xz/download">Download the image</a></p>
<p>* Extract the archive to get openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.img</p>
<p>* Dump openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.img on to a SD card<br />
(dd if=/path/to/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M; sync #replace /dev/sdX with your actual SD card device)</p>
<p>*  In case you have a bigger SD card, use yast2 disk(partitioner) to &#8220;expand&#8221; the second partition. You can use yast’s package manager to install more software. The default password for root is <strong>linux</strong>, you may want to change that first thing after booting.</p>
<p>I am unable to get sound on this hardware, probably <a href="https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-Mainline-bsp">their kernel</a> is missing sound related modules, if you figure out how to get sound working drop me a line so I can include it in next release.Everything else(wifi, hdmi out, USB ports etc) works well enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AMD has released the new AMD Catalyst 15.3 Beta. They have not yet released a public beta driver for all other distributions. It is currently available for Ubuntu. *sigh* So, it is a bit hard work to implement this in the makerpm-amd-script to replace the latest AMD Catalyst 14.12 with AMD Catalyst 15.3 Beta. So do not confused if the script downloads the AMD Catalyst 14.12. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no release notes from AMD. This update can solve the issue with PowerXpress but I can not really verified this because lack of such hardware.</p>
<p>Another side note I have implemented a workaround in the script to get the driver works with the GNOME Displaymanager + GNOME. It is a little cruel hack but it works for the moment. Thanks to the user that they posted the article in my blog. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>For GNOME user with gdm: Execute the following command as root after the installation of the AMD driver and before restart the machine:<br />
<code>sh makerpm-amd-15.3-beta.sh --install-gdm-fix</code><br />
If you update the AMD driver, so the workaround does not work anymore. It is important that you do not delete the file /amd_xversion and is needed for the workaround.</p>
<p>To revert the changes:<br />
<code>sh makerpm-amd-15.3-beta.sh --uninstall-gdm-fix</code></p>
<p>Before I forget it: All user from openSUSE Tumbleweed can also install the driver. But remember, Tumbleweed is under heavy development. I can not guarantee that the driver works in the future yet.</p>
<p><strong>Downloads:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Script: <a href="https://www.sebastian-siebert.de/downloads/makerpm-amd-15.3-beta.sh">makerpm-amd-15.3-beta.sh</a></li>
<li>SHA1: <a href="https://www.sebastian-siebert.de/downloads/makerpm-amd-15.3-beta.sh.sha1">makerpm-amd-15.3-beta.sh.sha1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Installation guide (English):<br />
<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx#Building_the_rpm_yourself">http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx#Building_the_rpm_yourself</a></p>
<p>The above named installation guide is only for the stable driver but you can adapt it for the beta driver.</p>
<p>Bruno Friedmann will build the new RPM packages in the fglrx repository. Stay tune!</p>
<p>If you find any issue with the driver. Don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me. I am in contact with AMD and can forward your issue to the right place. Feedback are welcome.</p>
<p>A report of your system is very helpful beside your feedback. You can generate it with the script:<br />
<code>su -c 'sh makerpm-amd-15.3-beta.sh -ur'</code></p>
<p>Have a lot of fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Christmas time around! AMD give us a new version of fglrx, and Sebastian Siebert just release his script yesterday night.<br />
So I&#8217;ve prepared the new version available for openSUSE 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 13.1, 13.2 and Tumbleweed.<br />
Sebastian&#8217;s script contain a special patch for supporting kernel up to 3.17 and 3.18 version.<br />
I should also share Sebastian&#8217;s surprize about the fact that this version didn&#8217;t got a beta/rc cycle&#8230;.
</p>
<p>I hope this release will give better results for all of you who own an apu (especially the recent one), and also fix a number of issue with the hybrid chipset intel cpu/amd gpu embedded.<br />
<br />See below how to report issue on Sebastian blog.
</p>
<p><strong>It will be the last build for all openSUSE version below 13.1</strong> (except if patches are needed).<br />
In January 12.3 support will definitively end. But I will let the drivers as is so you can still use them in case of.</p>
<h3>Installation / update</h3>
<p>Please refer to the wiki page <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx">SDB:AMD_fgrlx</a></p>
<h3>New packaging schema</h3>
<p>The driver is now splitted into different rpm that all need to be installed. Normally the necessary Require field is there and should happen automatically.</p>
<p>My advise is to check if you have them all installed.</p>
<p><strong>for 32 bits</strong></p>
<pre>
zypper install fglrx_xpic fglrx_core fglrx_graphics fglrx_amdcccle fglrx_opencl
</pre>
<p><strong>for 64 bits</strong></p>
<pre>
zypper install fglrx64_xpic fglrx64_core fglrx64_graphics fglrx64_amdcccle fglrx64_opencl
</pre>
<h3>A notice for Tumbleweed users</h3>
<p>The new release has now its package correctly named, previously they were called SUSEFACTORY, with the new version the package will contain SUSETUMBLEWEED in their name</p>
<p><span id="more-11102"></span></p>

<h4>Sebastien Siebert making script</h4>

<p>Damn I&#8217;m impressed by the number of steam games tested there, I should try some of them during hollidays <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If you have any problems with the driver, don&#8217;t be afraid to report to Sebastian (German and English bugreports are gladly accepted).<br />
he will try, as far as I am able to reproduce the bug. Together with the necessary system information, he will go directly to the right place at AMD to have the bug fixed in the next driver release.<br />
Thank you very much, Sebastian.
</p>
<p>See below what to do in case of troubles.</p>
<h4>Debugging and reporting troubles</h4>
<p>I recommend in case of trouble the use of <a href="http://www.sebastian-siebert.de/downloads/makerpm-amd-14.12.sh">his script</a> which can collect the whole informations needed to help you. then you just have to issue a simple commande in console to collect all informations, you can review them, and finally transmit them.<br />
Check the website to get the latest.

<h3>Reminder this drivers is only for radeon HD5xxx</h3>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above.<br />
For older gpu, the fglrx-legacy is still there see wiki page at<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx_legacy">SDB:AMD_fgrlx_legacy</a>.<br />
Beware of it obsolete status, and prefer the free open-source radeon driver which came out of the box from your openSUSE distribution.<br />
For 12.3, and more true with 13.1+ the free radeon often offer a better experience than the old fglrx-legacy, especially for HD2xxx-HD4xxx range.
</p>
<h2>Humor : the never ending links</h2>
<p>In 2014 April, I&#8217;ve decided to close the automatic redirection of http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/ati after being obsolete for more than one year.<br />
The reason was that there&#8217;s no safe way to drive people having a older Radeon HD card (series 2xxx to 4xxxx) to not use newer fglrx build.<br />
<br />
Guess what? I&#8217;m still seeing more than quarter billion hit on those address (for 12.1 to 13.1) <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />

If you click on such link referring to this url, please do your best to fix thoses and check your or friends computer configurations <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the fantastic work by <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM">openSUSE Arm</a> team, you can get full desktop on your armv7l powered phone or tablet(any recent dual core devices should work), without the need for repartition, formats, bootloader hacks or sacrificing your nicely running latest android on it. What you need is rooted device with busybox, Android VNC and terminal app installed and 4GB free space on sdcard(internal or external).<br />
<span id="more-9283"></span><br />
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/gaC5wP9kH4F8OLZG6kRrudMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HHQb8_OVFkQ/USMcM2NSDEI/AAAAAAAAFkQ/WNT1q5fALOA/s400/opensuse-arm1.png" width="400" height="239" /></a> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/N_NXLKjmQATAO5UycYr3j9MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WG0gSvWsHok/USMcQQLOwsI/AAAAAAAAFkY/SAyUl8nj7Qs/s400/opensuse-arm2.png" width="400" height="240" /></a><br />
1. Download <a title="opensuse-arm-xfce-chroot.tar.xz" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberorg-home/files/latest/download?source=files">opensuse-arm-xfce-chroot.tar.xz</a><br />
2. Extract the .xz file and place the 2 resulting files on your device&#8217;s sdcard.<br />
3. Open your favourite terminal app (or ssh into the device if you have dropbear ssh app installed), cd /to/sdcard/where/opensuse*.img/is/ &amp;&amp; sh opensuse.sh start<br />
4. Once the openSUSE starts you are chrooted inside the image in the terminal, for GUI start Android VNC and connect to localhost:1 (port 5901) or from remote machine IPofdevice:1. Password is &#8220;opensuse&#8221;. Change it to something else by running vncpasswd and passwd in desktop terminal, also change the root password by running passwd in chroot terminal where you ran &#8220;sh opensuse.sh start&#8221;.</p>
<p>After exiting the chroot terminal, openSUSE services will be stopped, no changes to your android system is made.</p>
<p>Have a lot of fun&#8230;</p>

<p>As I didn&#8217;t have a gpu card of this series, I can&#8217;t test it before publishing the rpm like for normal fglrx. If someone has a spare hd2xxx or hd4xxx, Could he(she) contact me?</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above.<br />
For older gpu, the fglrx-legacy is still 12.6, and thus didn&#8217;t work with Kernel 3.6, 3.7, 3.8<br />
<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx_legacy">SDB:AMD_fgrlx_legacy</a><br />
Beware of that fact, and prefer the free open-source radeon driver which came out of the box from your openSUSE distribution.

<h3>Release note about 13.1</h3>
<p>
This Catalyst fglrx version support openSUSE version from 11.4 to 12.3 (new repository) and also Tumbleweed (thus also kernel 3.8x series).<br />
For testing with the next openSUSE 12.3 just use the new openSUSE_12.3 repo

<p>If you have any problems with the driver, don&#8217;t be afraid to report to Sebastian (German and English bugreports are gladly accepted).<br />
he will try, as far as I am able to reproduce the bug. Together with the necessary system information, he will go directly to the right place at AMD to have the bug fixed in the next driver release.<br />
Thank you very much, Sebastian.

<p>I recommend in case of trouble the use of <a href="http://www.sebastian-siebert.de/downloads/makerpm-amd-13.1.sh">his script</a> which can collect the whole informations needed to help you. then you just have to issue a simple commande in console to collect all informations, you can review them, and finally transmit them.<br />
Check the website to get the latest.

<h3>Quick Résumé about 12.3</h3>
<p>AMD rename their installer, So Sebastian did the same for his script.</p>
<p>I will just copy/google translate/paste here the comment made by Sebastian Siebert on his blog :</p>
<div id="attachment_8607" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fglrx12.3-screenshot1.png"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fglrx12.3-screenshot1-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8607" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">amd ccc and fgl_glgears running</p></div>
<p style="font-style:italic">
The packaging script was updated because I have a compile error when building a kernel module fglrx in the kernel 3.2.8+ and 3.3+. Due to the very tight time window, the patches could no longer be incorporated into AMD Catalyst 12.3. Only in the upcoming AMD Catalyst 12.4, the patches from me for openSUSE will be available. AMD Catalyst 12.5 they will be officially included for all other distributions. Yes, with the makerpm-amd script made for you, I can despatch on very simple, convenient and quick patches or missing useful extensions via the script packaging update. Who need to wait months.<br />
Driver support now AMD Radeon HD 7950, HD 7970, HD 7990

<p>My advise is to firstly remove any existing version with zypper rm, then just zypper in the new version,<br />
even if 8.930 was the first version I&#8217;ve seen able to upgrade correctly.<br />
The 8.950 leave a file that need to be manually removed /etc/ati/amdpcsdb. The 8.951 fix that now.</p>
<p>As usual, I let the previous versions in the repository, just in case you need it.</p>
<p>Tested on a fresh 12.1 + updates and kde 4.8.1</p>
<p>
12.2 Factory rpms are presently available, use at your own risk, and report bugs in forums and Sebastian blogs.<br />
Anyways, factory and 12.2 should keep their effort on debuging and testing widely the free radeon driver.

<h3>One-click-installer</h3>
<p>Two one-click-installer are available here :<br />
For 32bits system :<br />
<a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/ati/raw-src/amd-ati-fglrx.ymp"><img src="http://en.opensuse.org/images/e/e9/Fglrx_1click.png" alt="AMD/ATI fglrx one click installer" /></a></p>
<p>For 64bits system :<br />
<a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/ati/raw-src/amd-ati-fglrx64.ymp"><img src="http://en.opensuse.org/images/e/e9/Fglrx_1click.png" alt="AMD/ATI fglrx one click installer" /></a><br />
<span style="font-size:small">(*) To know which kind of system you have, open a console, then run uname -a and look the output if you see x86_64 on the line you are running a 64bits, otherwise a 32bits.</span>
</p>
<h3>Installation, Caution, Troubles</h3>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Please refer to my <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=6680">previous article</a> where all the installation procedure was explained.</p>
<p>
For a first installation, if you don&#8217;t remove radeon from the initrd, you will certainly get in trouble. Don&#8217;t thanks who removed that from the wiki. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="&#x1f641;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
</p>
<h4>Caution</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wrong (to my point of view) create an xorg.conf file which is unneeded if you work with /etc/xorg.conf.d/50-device.conf and have driver &#8220;fglrx&#8221; inside</li>
<li>AMD CCLE didn&#8217;t get correctly upgraded if xorg is running during the upgrade. My advise, let&#8217;s go to console and as root do the following :
<pre>
init 3
rcatievenstd stop
zypper ref
zypper up
init 6
</pre>
<p>Let the package rebuild the kernel driver. And for me I always remove the newly xorg.conf file created.<br />
reboot is mandatory!
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Debuging troubles</h4>
<p>I recommend in case of trouble the use of <a href="http://www.sebastian-siebert.de/downloads/makerpm-amd-12.2.sh">his script</a> which can collect the whole informations needed to help you. then you just have to issue a simple commande in console to collect all informations, you can review them, and finally transmit them</p>
<pre>su -c 'sh makerpm-amd-12.2.sh -ur'
The sytem report 'amd-report.txt' was generated.                                                                                                                    [ OK ]
