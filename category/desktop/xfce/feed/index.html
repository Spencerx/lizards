				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the fantastic work by <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM">openSUSE Arm</a> team, you can get full desktop on your armv7l powered phone or tablet(any recent dual core devices should work), without the need for repartition, formats, bootloader hacks or sacrificing your nicely running latest android on it. What you need is rooted device with busybox, Android VNC and terminal app installed and 4GB free space on sdcard(internal or external).<br />
<span id="more-9283"></span><br />
<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/gaC5wP9kH4F8OLZG6kRrudMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HHQb8_OVFkQ/USMcM2NSDEI/AAAAAAAAFkQ/WNT1q5fALOA/s400/opensuse-arm1.png" width="400" height="239" /></a> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/N_NXLKjmQATAO5UycYr3j9MTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=embedwebsite"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WG0gSvWsHok/USMcQQLOwsI/AAAAAAAAFkY/SAyUl8nj7Qs/s400/opensuse-arm2.png" width="400" height="240" /></a><br />
1. Download <a title="opensuse-arm-xfce-chroot.tar.xz" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberorg-home/files/latest/download?source=files">opensuse-arm-xfce-chroot.tar.xz</a><br />
2. Extract the .xz file and place the 2 resulting files on your device&#8217;s sdcard.<br />
3. Open your favourite terminal app (or ssh into the device if you have dropbear ssh app installed), cd /to/sdcard/where/opensuse*.img/is/ &amp;&amp; sh opensuse.sh start<br />
4. Once the openSUSE starts you are chrooted inside the image in the terminal, for GUI start Android VNC and connect to localhost:1 (port 5901) or from remote machine IPofdevice:1. Password is &#8220;opensuse&#8221;. Change it to something else by running vncpasswd and passwd in desktop terminal, also change the root password by running passwd in chroot terminal where you ran &#8220;sh opensuse.sh start&#8221;.</p>
<p>After exiting the chroot terminal, openSUSE services will be stopped, no changes to your android system is made.</p>
<p>Have a lot of fun&#8230;</p>

<p>As I didn&#8217;t have a gpu card of this series, I can&#8217;t test it before publishing the rpm like for normal fglrx. If someone has a spare hd2xxx or hd4xxx, Could he(she) contact me?</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>Sorry this article should have been published Saturday, but some trouble (error in a updated module) locked me outside of lizards), Thanks to Matthew to have fix it in the meantime</p>
<div id="attachment_9218" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/?attachment_id=9218" rel="attachment wp-att-9218"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/fglrx13.1-screenshot1-150x150.jpg" alt="fglrx 13.1 amd-ccc &amp; fgl_glxgears" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-9218" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">fglrx 13.1 amd-ccc &amp; fgl_glxgears</p></div>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above.<br />
For older gpu, the fglrx-legacy is still 12.6, and thus didn&#8217;t work with Kernel 3.6, 3.7, 3.8<br />
<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx_legacy">SDB:AMD_fgrlx_legacy</a><br />
Beware of that fact, and prefer the free open-source radeon driver which came out of the box from your openSUSE distribution.
</p>
<h3>Release note about 13.1</h3>
<p>
This Catalyst fglrx version support openSUSE version from 11.4 to 12.3 (new repository) and also Tumbleweed (thus also kernel 3.8x series).<br />

<h4>Sebastien Siebert making script</h4>
<p style="clear:both"><a href="http://www.sebastian-siebert.de/2013/01/18/opensuse-proprietaeren-grafik-treiber-amd-catalyst-13-1-als-rpm-installieren/">Sebastian Siebert post about 13.1</a></p>
<p>If you have any problems with the driver, don&#8217;t be afraid to report to Sebastian (German and English bugreports are gladly accepted).<br />
he will try, as far as I am able to reproduce the bug. Together with the necessary system information, he will go directly to the right place at AMD to have the bug fixed in the next driver release.<br />
Thank you very much, Sebastian.
</p>
<p>See below what to do in case of troubles.</p>
<p>Or you can also ping him on irc (freespacer)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_9219" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/?attachment_id=9219" rel="attachment wp-att-9219"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/fglrx13.1-screenshot2-150x150.jpg" alt="fglrx &amp; 3d effects kde 4.9.5 on openSUSE 12.2" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-9219" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">fglrx &amp; 3d effects kde 4.9.5 on openSUSE 12.2</p></div><br />
<span id="more-9215"></span></p>
<h3>Quick overview</h3>
<p>For openSUSE version 11.3 and above</p>
<ol><b>Have a radeon hd5xxx and above</b></p>
<li>You have to use the standard fglrx</li>
<li>Use the new repository http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx/openSUSE_<span style="font-style:italic">VERSION</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx">SDB:AMD_fgrlx</a></span></li>
</ol>
<ol><b>Have a radeon between hd2xxx and hd4xxx</b></p>
<li>You have to use the legacy fglrx version</li>
<li>Use the new repository http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-legacy//openSUSE_<span style="font-style:italic">VERSION</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx_legacy">SDB:AMD_fgrlx_legacy</a></span></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that legacy has not yet been updated, and so can&#8217;t be use on kernel 3.6+ (Tumbleweed, 12.3 or kotd)</p>

<h4>Debugging troubles</h4>
<p>I recommend in case of trouble the use of <a href="http://www.sebastian-siebert.de/downloads/makerpm-amd-13.1.sh">his script</a> which can collect the whole informations needed to help you. then you just have to issue a simple commande in console to collect all informations, you can review them, and finally transmit them.<br />
Check the website to get the latest.

<h2>AMD/ATI Catalyst 12.3 / fglrx 8.951 rpms are available</h2>
<h3>Quick Résumé about 12.3</h3>
<p>AMD rename their installer, So Sebastian did the same for his script.</p>
<p>I will just copy/google translate/paste here the comment made by Sebastian Siebert on his blog :</p>
<div id="attachment_8607" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fglrx12.3-screenshot1.png"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fglrx12.3-screenshot1-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-8607" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">amd ccc and fgl_glgears running</p></div>
<p style="font-style:italic">
The packaging script was updated because I have a compile error when building a kernel module fglrx in the kernel 3.2.8+ and 3.3+. Due to the very tight time window, the patches could no longer be incorporated into AMD Catalyst 12.3. Only in the upcoming AMD Catalyst 12.4, the patches from me for openSUSE will be available. AMD Catalyst 12.5 they will be officially included for all other distributions. Yes, with the makerpm-amd script made for you, I can despatch on very simple, convenient and quick patches or missing useful extensions via the script packaging update. Who need to wait months.<br />
Driver support now AMD Radeon HD 7950, HD 7970, HD 7990
</p>
<p>See more at <a href="http://www.sebastian-siebert.de/2012/03/29/opensuse-proprietaeren-grafik-treiber-amd-catalyst-12-3-als-rpm-installieren/">Sebastian&#8217;s blog</a>.<br />
Don&#8217;t be shy, you can leave there the result of test in english too <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
or ask in forums, irc and ping freespacer.<br />
See below what to do in case of troubles.</p>
<p>The rpms version 8.951 are available from Friday March 30th.</p>
<p><span id="more-8604"></span><br />
<a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fglrx12.3-screenshot2.png"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fglrx12.3-screenshot2-300x168.png" alt="" width="300" height="168" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8608" /></a></p>
<p>My advise is to firstly remove any existing version with zypper rm, then just zypper in the new version,<br />
even if 8.930 was the first version I&#8217;ve seen able to upgrade correctly.<br />
The 8.950 leave a file that need to be manually removed /etc/ati/amdpcsdb. The 8.951 fix that now.</p>
<p>As usual, I let the previous versions in the repository, just in case you need it.</p>
<p>Tested on a fresh 12.1 + updates and kde 4.8.1</p>
<p>
12.2 Factory rpms are presently available, use at your own risk, and report bugs in forums and Sebastian blogs.<br />
Anyways, factory and 12.2 should keep their effort on debuging and testing widely the free radeon driver.
</p>
<h3>One-click-installer</h3>
<p>Two one-click-installer are available here :<br />
For 32bits system :<br />
<a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/ati/raw-src/amd-ati-fglrx.ymp"><img src="http://en.opensuse.org/images/e/e9/Fglrx_1click.png" alt="AMD/ATI fglrx one click installer" /></a></p>
<p>For 64bits system :<br />
<a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/ati/raw-src/amd-ati-fglrx64.ymp"><img src="http://en.opensuse.org/images/e/e9/Fglrx_1click.png" alt="AMD/ATI fglrx one click installer" /></a><br />
<span style="font-size:small">(*) To know which kind of system you have, open a console, then run uname -a and look the output if you see x86_64 on the line you are running a 64bits, otherwise a 32bits.</span>
</p>
<h3>Installation, Caution, Troubles</h3>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Please refer to my <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=6680">previous article</a> where all the installation procedure was explained.</p>
<p>
For a first installation, if you don&#8217;t remove radeon from the initrd, you will certainly get in trouble. Don&#8217;t thanks who removed that from the wiki. <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':-(' class='wp-smiley' />
</p>
<h4>Caution</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wrong (to my point of view) create an xorg.conf file which is unneeded if you work with /etc/xorg.conf.d/50-device.conf and have driver &#8220;fglrx&#8221; inside</li>
<li>AMD CCLE didn&#8217;t get correctly upgraded if xorg is running during the upgrade. My advise, let&#8217;s go to console and as root do the following :
<pre>
init 3
rcatievenstd stop
zypper ref
zypper up
init 6
</pre>
<p>Let the package rebuild the kernel driver. And for me I always remove the newly xorg.conf file created.<br />
reboot is mandatory!
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fglrx12.3-screenshot3.png"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fglrx12.3-screenshot3-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8609" /></a></p>
<h4>Debuging troubles</h4>
<p>I recommend in case of trouble the use of <a href="http://www.sebastian-siebert.de/downloads/makerpm-amd-12.2.sh">his script</a> which can collect the whole informations needed to help you. then you just have to issue a simple commande in console to collect all informations, you can review them, and finally transmit them</p>
<pre>su -c 'sh makerpm-amd-12.2.sh -ur'
The sytem report 'amd-report.txt' was generated.                                                                                                                    [ OK ]
Do you want to read the system report 'amd-report.txt' now? yes/no [y/n]: y
Are you sure to upload the above-named system report to sprunge.to? yes/no [y/n]: y

The report was uploaded to sprunge.us.

<h2>Desktop Summit</h2>
<h3>Last minute team</h3>
<p>
Monday before Desktop Summit, I&#8217;ve just learned that we (as openSUSE/SUSE) will not have the SuseStudio kiosk.<br />
Too bad, but Wednesday, I finally get confirmation from my customer, that the new hardware will not be delivered before Friday 12th. Ah ah good news. I will be able to go to Berlin. So I bought the last airplane ticket for Friday afternoon, and also the last bed at good price.

</ul>
<h3>Collaboration across the border</h3>
<p>Discussing with Enlightment team <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/">[website]</a> to convince them to use OBS and really give it a try, inviting them to join us at OSC11, and try to push them to become our fifth choice&#8217;s desktop.
</p>
<p>Invite also KolabSystem to join us, and let&#8217;s talk about using OBS, and how to have better interaction between us and them<br />
I address here an official thanks to Georg C.F. Greve, Izabele and Co. who kindly stay awake during my last night in Berlin.
</p>
<p>Help Izabel Valverde to find a good wifi connection, and quiet place to finish her presentation. Yeap inside the University the wifi really sucks.</p>
<p>Artwork : start to discuss with several people if we can build a real collaboration team about artwork. And try something really new and different for 12.1. Nothing is done yet, but future will tell me if I&#8217;m right or not<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve received some emails and some positive feedback about one wallpaper I used for a couple of screenshot&#8217;s I&#8217;ve used in the past, including also information requests about where that very same wallpaper could be found. I&#8217;m happy people liked my choice.</p>
<p>The wallpaper is question is the following, which can be found at <a href="http://gnome-look.org" target="_blank">gnome-look [dot] org</a>:</p>
<div id="attachment_6350" style="width: 560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Green+Snake+HD?content=70282"><img class="size-full wp-image-6350" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/snake.png" alt="" width="550" height="344" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Green Snake HD - by Kmurat @ gnome-art.org</p></div>
<p>It is clear to me at this stage that Artwork has good demand and it&#8217;s a &#8216;value +&#8217; recognized by many users. Understanding this, I&#8217;ve decided two things:</p>
<p>* GNOME:Ayatana will have a small Artwork Package by the Community, I&#8217;m currently contacting Kmurat to check if he can change the licence on this artwork piece (with over 20.000 downloads on gnome-art) so I can use it for distribution. Currently it&#8217;s licensed as CC BY-NC-ND, in which the NC can be probably a problem. Let&#8217;s wait a couple of days and see&#8230; Either way for those who asked for the source of this wallpaper, click on the image above.</p>
<p>* I will create a small package with wallpapers from the community and make it available (for GNOME, KDE, etc) users.</p>
<p>My intentions are to include a set of wallpapers (4/3, 16/9 and 16/10) of around 5/7 wallpapers from several artists and community contributors. The first person I&#8217;ve contacted regarding this was Javier Llorente, a openSUSE Artwork Team and KDE contributor, which donated and pointed some artwork. I&#8217;ve also sent a small email to <a href="http://tatica.org" target="_blank">María &#8216;Tatica&#8217; Leandro</a>, a contributor of Fedora Design Team from South America asking if she had something that she could share with us for this community package (I did loved some of her submissions into Fedora Art). Additionally, I&#8217;m also going to nag <a href="http://karl-tux-stadt.de" target="_blank">Sirko Kemter</a> (gnokii) for a contribution&#8230;</p>
<p>Once this is assembled (already have 5 wallpapers) I&#8217;m going to package it, run a sanity check and prepare it for distribution&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>María &#8216;Tatica&#8217; Leandro has answered positive to my email requesting for a donation, Sirko Kemter also answered positive.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I try testing xfce4 desktop and find some bugs. But I also find that some really interesting missing in opensuse build service, so I add two new applications to build service (<a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/GNOME:/Community/openSUSE_Factory/">gnome community repository</a>&#8230;but now gaupol is available only in my <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jreidinger:/gaupol/openSUSE_Factory/">personal repository</a>, because in gnome pygtk wait for python 1.6) &#8211; <a href="http://clay.ll.pl/osmo/">osmo</a> and <a href="http://home.gna.org/gaupol/">gaupol</a>.<br />
 <span id="more-280"></span><br />
I start with gaupol which I often use to correct subtitle timing. Yes it is subtitle editor, which support translating, previewing or converting between subtitle format. more info you can get on project website &#8211; <a href="http://home.gna.org/gaupol/">http://home.gna.org/gaupol/</a>. This package depends on python bindings of enchant library, so I also package that wrapper. And here is screenshot how it run on opensuse beta4 with xfce desktop:<br />

Second is osmo. This is personal organizer for your appointments or tasks. It is nice described in <a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/123837"> article on linux.com </a>. I only add to it that it is good integrated to xfce enviroment (see right up corner on screenshot) and I personally prefer it against orage which is xfce project. It depends only on library for synchronizing syncml and library for support icalendar Libical. And screenshot for osmo:<br />
<a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/osmo.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-282" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/osmo-300x240.png" alt="osmo" width="300" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>This is my first work with build service and It take me two hour to package this applications. So don&#8217;t wait and also prepare your own package for software which you miss in opensuse. But at first try <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/search"> search </a>, if someone before you doesn&#8217;t make it and share his(her) work with you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many people will have noticed from my ramblings on <a href="http://twitter.com/awafaa" title="My tweets">twitter</a> and <a href="http://identi.ca/awafaa" title="My dents">identi.ca</a> and also from my sporadic almost dumb sounding questions on IRC (thanks very much for your patience in IRC btw), I have been working on getting a usable installation of openSUSE on the eeePC 701 &#8211; both GNOME and KDE4.  As I have a 4GB SSD model my aim is to have a feature full install taking up no more than 2.6GB.  Yes I know this doesn&#8217;t help those with the 2GB model, but I&#8217;m scratching my own itch here <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> .  Ultimately I would like to be able to create USB and CD images of the builds in time for 11.1&#8242;s release which is in about 43 days time, problem is KIWI does not like me <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' />  but I will persevere and see what I can conjure up in time.  I am a happy user of openSUSE 11.0 with XFCE on my eeePC at the moment, but I fancy a bit of a challenge and a good dose of stress and anger trying to get it to work will be a welcome distraction from the stress and chaos I have to deal with at work <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>So what packages am I looking at putting on there? Below are a couple of tables of applications and what I have selected for each DE including ASUS eeePC related drivers (ACPI/Events) and also bluetooth; I have tried to stick to those that come with the DE e.g. all KDE apps are KDE4 variants, and if a DE provides an app for a function I try to use that.&#160; So the first iteration of the table is:</p>

<p>As you can see KDE4 takes up the least amount of space followed by XFCE with GNOME dropping into third place.&#160; This surprised me as I actually expected XFCE to be way ahead in the lead.&#160; I then tried to minimise the number of applications and tried to use apps that could multi task, still prefering those that are included as part of the openSUSE distro:</p>

<p>As you can see KDE is still the leader, but GNOME has managed to close the gap significantly.</p>
<p>You will notice that there are some notable applications missing from both tables, both from the Mozilla family &#8211; FireFox and Thunderbird.&#160; I chose not to use FireFox as the browser as I have been experiencing some icky lockups with it, and this is irrespective of platform.&#160; I decided against Thunderbird because it just did not like to display correctly on the 7&#8243; screen, even the version supplied by Xandros refused to display nicely.&#160; As KDE4 doesn&#8217;t have a native IRC client yet I have chosen irssi, i will update the list when a native KDE4 client is available &#8211; most likely <a href="http://quassel-irc.org/">Quassel</a>.&#160; Also as it stands Kaffeine is not available for KDE4 yet, when that happens I would imagine I would replace MPlayer with it.</p>
<p>Both the GNOME and KDE4 builds were based on a minimal X install &#8211; for GNOME add gnome-panel and gnome-session; for for KDE add kdebase4-session, kdebase4-workspace and kde4-win; XFCE was based on the supplied pattern.&#160; One thing I did notice is that 11.1 (Beta4) seems to have put on a bit of weight in comparison to 11.0, a base install appears to be ~400MB more O_o.&#160; I am going to to do a verification shortly and file a bug so hopefully I can thin them out even further.</p>
<p>If people have any recommendations or suggestions as to what applications to use, then please let me know.&#160; My next step is to create both ISO and USB images, any and all help would be much appreciated &#8211; <a href="http://www.susestudio.com/">SUSEStudio</a> access would be even better <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> &#160; This list is not meant to be the be all and end all, but more a matter of itch scratching.&#160; Yes I know I could reduce the space taken up if I didnt bother with any of that non-free codec crud, and drop flash from the equation, but I&#8217;m pragmatic and ultimately want to see people use openSUSE.&#160; Get them using our distro first, once thatis established then we can educate them on the ugly side of things.&#160; Once I manage to create the images with the above package list i will look at creating a completely free version with no colsed codecs/apps.</p>
<p>Once again I&#8217;d like to thank all those on IRC for there help and advice &#8211; <a href="http://jprosevear.org/blog">JP Rosevear</a>, <a href="http://www.snorp.net/log">James Wilcox</a>, <a href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/blog/457">Stephan Binner</a>, <a href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/blog/77">Will Stephenson</a>, <a href="http://mschlander.wordpress.com/">Martin Schandler</a> and <a href="http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/" title="Diary of a CrazyFrench">Hubert Figuiere</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As some of you might already have noticed, we are working on a better integration of Xfce in openSUSE. The aim of the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Xfce_Project" target="_blank">Xfce Project</a> is to establish Xfce as well-accepted desktop environment besides GNOME and KDE. We have already started building Xfce LiveCDs with KIWI but still fail in getting yast-live to work.</p>
<p>Besides that we had some success in the re-design process, so this is how the upcoming Xfce in openSUSE might look like:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/xfce41.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-58" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/xfce41-300x187.png" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/xfce4_21.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-61" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/xfce4_21-300x187.png" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a></p>
<p>Miguel Cruz has provided his great CrashBit theme and designed a few new icons to improve Xfce support.</p>
<p>I have also finished a SLiM Display Manager theme and work on some packages for that. There is still a lot of work to be done and things to coordinate. We are going to set up a oS Xfce Mailing List soon, that all interested people should join. In the near future I am continuing to blog about the current development process, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Update: The Mailinglist is now availabl.: To subscribe send an eMail to: <a href="mailto:opensuse-xfce%2Bsubscribe@opensuse.org">opensuse-xfce+subscribe@opensuse.org</a></p>
<p>I have also added an upgraded screenshot showing how it would look like using the Gilouche Window decoration.</p>
<p>Marcus</p>
