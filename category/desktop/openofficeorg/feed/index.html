				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iâm happy to announce first LibreOffice <em>3.5 </em>packages for <em>openSUSE</em>. They are available in the Build Service <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Unstable/">LibreOffice:Unstable</a> project. It provides many interesting features:</p>
<ul>
<li>better UI for header/footer handling</li>
<li>multi-line input bar in Calc</li>
<li>Import filter for Microsoft Visio documents</li>
<li>enhanced custom shapes import</li>
<li>modelessÂ  word count dialog</li>
<li>improved font hinting for high quality docs</li>
<li>more secure encryption algorithm (AES-256) for password protected files</li>
<li>better displaying of non-printable characters on the end of line</li>
<li>and<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/3-5-new-features-and-fixes/"> much more</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The current <em>openSUSE</em> packages are based on the <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download/release-notes/" target="_blank">LibreOffice 3.5.2 release</a>. Please, look for more details about the <em>openSUSE LibreOffice build</em> on the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/LibreOffice" target="_blank">wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>The openSUSE LO team hopes that you will be happy with this release. Though, any software contains bugs and we kindly ask you to <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Bugreport_LO" target="_blank">report bugs</a>. It will help us to fix them in the future releases.</p>
<p><strong>Known bugs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>problems with <em>KDE 4.8.2</em> from <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=KDE%3ADistro%3AFactory">KDE:Distro:Factory</a> project (<a title="bnc#755886" href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=755886" target="_blank">bnc#755886</a>)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other information and plans:</strong></p>
<p>The current <em>LibreOffice-3.5 </em>packages are based on the second bugfix release and should be pretty stable. I want to move them into the <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Stable/">LibreOffice:Stable</a> project within next two weeks. I just want to make sure that I did not do any mistake during packaging, e.g. breaking dependencies. Also the <em>KDE4</em> integration need to be tested because it was not provided by the upstream build. Any feedback is welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Other information and plans:</strong></p>
<p>It took me quite some time to prepare the <em>3.4</em> update because the split build was not longer supported and I had to completely rework the packages.</p>
<p>We are going to prepare official maintenance update for <em>openSUSE-11.3</em> and <em>11.4</em>. You might expect it within next few weeks.</p>
<p>I am going further improve the build framework to be able to early provide <em>LO-3.5</em> packages in the <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Unstable/">LibreOffice:Unstable</a> project. You might expect something about Christmas, see the <a href="http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleasePlan#3.5_release">LibreOffice 3.5 schedule</a>.</p>

<p>The bugfix release 3.3.4 is planed two months from now. Though, I would rather provide LO-3.4.2 packages instead.</p>
<p>I am already working on the LO-3.4 packages. They are more complicated because there were significant changes in the build stuff.

<p>The <em>3.3.2</em> packages includes <em>KDE3</em> support again. Thanks <em>Lubos Lunak</em> who fixed all known issues and<em> Ilya Chernykh</em> who helped with packaging.</p>
<p>The <em>3.3.2</em> release is in a very good shape, so we decided to slow down the bug fixes release cycle. You might expect the <em>3.3.3</em> bug fix release two months from now.</p>
<p><em>LO-3.4</em> feature freeze is pretty close and we will start producing test packages in the <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Unstable/">LibreOffice:Unstable</a> project. Please, be patient because there are many interesting changes in the build framework. They are good for the future but I expect some problems with packaging. I hope that I will manage to provide something by the end of April.</p>

<p><strong>False error during update</strong></p>
<p>You might see some installation errors about missing extensions when updating from OpenOffice.org, for example:</p>
<blockquote><p>ERROR: There is no such extension deployed: com.sun.reportdesigner</p></blockquote>
<p>Please, <strong>ignore them</strong>. They are caused by a bug in the OOo packages and can&#8217;t be avoided easily. They does not affect the LibreOffice installation!</p>
<p><strong>More known bugs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://alturl.com/dmqve">Free Desktop bugzilla</a></li>
<li><a href="http://alturl.com/qaq5">Novell bugzilla</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other information and plans:</strong></p>
<p>LO switched to a time based schedule and more frequent bug fix releases. The purpose is to keep quality and avoid infinite RC phase at the same time. The idea is that all serious blocker bugs can be found and fixed within few weeks. Then the application is ready for masses who want to enjoy new features and more complicated fixes. The history says that bugs in less typical scenarios are found weeks after the release. Such bugs will be fixed in pure bug fix releases and released few weeks after each other. It means that more conservative people should rather wait for the 3.x.1, 3.x.2, 3.x.3 releases. We hope that it will help all people to get faster what they want.</p>
<p>We are already working on <em>LO-3.3.1</em> bugfix release. I have just published <em>3.3.1-rc1</em>. The <em>final 3.3.1</em> release should be available within 2 weeks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Iâm happy to announce that LibreOffice <em>3.3 rc4 </em> packages are available for<em> openSUSE </em> in the Build Service <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/LibreOffice:/Unstable/">LibreOffice:Unstable</a> project. They are based on the <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/build/plain/NEWS?id=libreoffice-3.3.0.4" target="_blank">libreoffice-3.3.0.4 release</a>. Please, look for more details about the <em>openSUSE LibreOffice build</em> on the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/OpenOffice.org" target="_blank">wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>The packages are based on LibreOffice release candidate sources. Though, they include some addons from the old <em>Go-oo</em> project.Â  They have not  passed full QA round yet and might include even serious bugs. Therefore  they are <em>not</em> intended for <em>data-critical</em> usage. A good practice is to archive any important data before an use, â¦</p>
<p>As usual, we kindly ask any interested <em>beta testers</em> to try the package and <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Bugreport_OOo" target="_blank">report bugs</a> against the product <em>LibreOffice</em> .</p>
<p><strong>Known bugs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>some packages were not renamed, .e.g. <em>OpenOffice_org-thesaurus</em>, &#8230;; they are not built from the main <em>LibO</em> sources; I will do soon.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Other information and plans:</strong></p>
<p>First, I am sorry that I did not announce two older builds. I published <em>rc2</em> build just before Christmas and the announce was forgot in the hurry. There were problems with building <em>rc3</em>. It was ready only one day before <em>rc4</em>, so it did not make sense to announce it.</p>
<p>There still might be some <em>openSUSE-specific</em> bugs that would need to be fixed. I hope that they do not break the base function but&#8230; I will continue with producing newer builds with more fixes from the stable <em>libreoffice-3-3</em> branch. I will move the packages to a stable project once we finish testing of all the SUSE-specific addons. It should happen within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Please be patient and thanks for understanding.</p>
