				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Proprietary AMD/ATI Catalyst fglrx 13.12 (13.251-1) rpm released</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_10366" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gekjoxmas01-SNOW.gif"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/gekjoxmas01-SNOW-150x150.gif" alt="Geeko Santa Claus - Crédits Carlos Ribeiro" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-10366" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Geeko Santa Claus &#8211; Crédits Carlos Ribeiro</p></div>
<p>Patience is a virtue, months of it and finally we got a proof that Santa Claus exist <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
This release allow me to wish you a Merry Christmas!
</p>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above.<br />
For older gpu, the fglrx-legacy is still 13.1, and thus didn&#8217;t work with openSUSE 12.3 or above.<br />
<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx_legacy">SDB:AMD_fgrlx_legacy</a><br />
Beware of that, and prefer the free open-source radeon driver which came out of the box from your openSUSE distribution.<br />
For 12.3 and especially 13.1 the free radeon often offer a better experience than the old fglrx-legacy.
</p>
<h4>Changing the signer of package</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve done a change with which key used for signing the package and repository. So you will need to trust the new key for the repository</p>
<pre>
zypper ref -f -r amd-fglrx
Forcing raw metadata refresh
Retrieving repository 'amd-fglrx' metadata ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[\]

New repository or package signing key received:
Key ID: 484F703065BE584C
Key Name: builder Ioda-Net (Building and signing packages build at Ioda-Net) 
Key Fingerprint: 80D079EBFB1AB0FEE3CA41E6484F703065BE584C
Key Created: lun 30 jui 2012 15:27:35 CEST
Key Expires: sam 29 jui 2017 15:27:35 CEST

<h4>Help for spreading the word</h4>
<p>Dear fellow I&#8217;m counting on you to spread the word, in the different social media you&#8217;re subscribed, and also on Mailing list, forums.<br />
Feel free also to translate it into your native language
</p>
<h3>Release note about 13.12</h3>
<p>
This Catalyst fglrx version support openSUSE version from 11.4 to 13.1 and also Tumbleweed (thus also kernel 3.12/13 series).<br />
A special thanks to Sebastian Siebert for his effort on making this driver working under openSUSE.
</p>
<p>If a kind German geeko can take the time to translate his article, put the result in comments below, you will understand that getting it working,<br />
is not just Fun.</p>
<h4>Notice for users of the -beta repository</h4>
<p>If you previously used the fglrx drivers using the -beta created for fglrx 13.11, you could not switch back the url of the repository to the standard one.<br />
The beta will contain now outdated driver until AMD release a new one.<br />
If you were using the normal repository the update should appear directly
</p>
<pre>To change the url if your repository is called FGLRX
zypper mr -n FLGRX http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx/openSUSE_13.1
</pre>
<h3>Tumbleweed</h3>
<p>For tumbleweed due to the change of openSUSE version from 12.3 to 13.1, you will certainly have remove the old package and install the new one.</p>
<pre>
zypper rm fglrx64_xpic_SUSE123

zypper in fglrx64_xpic_SUSE131
[snipped par of installation]
Calling 'depmod -a 3.12.5-3.g48b587a-desktop' this may take a while...

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was kid Commodore 64 was big thing and I played &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsQsKaMAek" title="Gateway to Apshai youtube">Gateway to Apshai</a>&#8216; hour after hour. It really hit me. Others liked Ultimas but &#8216;Gateway to Apshai&#8217; was THE thing to me. Years after C64 was gone with the wind I found world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29" title="Rogue">Rogue</a>, <a href="http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Omega" title="Omega">Omega</a> and <a href="http://www.nethack.org/" title="Nethack">Nethack</a>. Sweetest of them was Omega. Omega&#8217;s World map was big and you could do what ever you like and wander around and you didn&#8217;t have to fight all the time. As this was a long, long time ago none of those games are no more in active development but Sami Maaranen is still developing unique northern hemisphere survival game called <a href="http://www.unrealworld.fi/" title="UnReal World RPG">UnReal World RPG</a>.<br />
<img src="http://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/17/16794/thumb_300x150/mainscreen318b3.PNG" alt="UnReal World RPG 3.18beta3 start screen" /><img src="http://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/17/16794/thumb_300x150/urw318-restock.png" alt="UnReal World RPG 3.18beta3" /><br />

<span id="more-10329"></span></p>
<h2>UnReal World RPG</h2>
<p>What makes UnReal World RPG so unique? Game is huge, difficult level is infernal and it&#8217;s all about survival in north (Iron-Age Finland actually). As said UnReal World RPG tries to be as quite realistic. You won&#8217;t find goblins nor elves around but UnReal World RPG gives you elks, mooses, bears, wolves, lynxes and really long dark cold winter. If you want to survive the arctic winter you have to try little bit harder (and you probably die). If you like to get into fight you probably die or you get serious wounds and you probably die soon because you can&#8217;t make fire.<br />
Many times this game feels a bit sadistic in modeling how hard it have been in Iron-Age Finland but developer Sami Maaranen (and co-designer Erkka Lehmus) have spent lots of time studying about old ways crafting things, building traps and living off the land in general. As said before learning curve in this game is bit steep but there are plenty of &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK7CXT67arU&amp;list=PLOCBEcNdfIeXVSaKDs97TMKlrdAGr72Pc" title="Let's Play UnReal World RPG">Let&#8217;s play</a>&#8216;-videos floating in Internet to help you out and you can&#8217;t find many games that gives you so much fun. So if you like survival games this is for you.</p>
<h2>This sounds good</h2>
<p>And it is. UnReal World RPG is not Open Source nor it&#8217;s Free Software but it&#8217;s free to play and download (no strings attached). Developer is only asking donations and if you like the game you should really consider to donate small amount to support the development.</p>
<h2>Little bit deeper look</h2>
<p>UnReal World, or shortly UrW, was first released in 1992 as more traditional fantasy roguelike game. Then it evolved and evolved steadily. URW started as MS DOS ascii based game after that was VGA/SVGA DOS upper memory semi graphics version. Third generation took URW to Windows world with SDL-library. At that point notorious rewrite of graphics, sounds and user interface was proceeded, but it was heavily tied to MS Windows world.</p>
<h2>porting UnReal World RPG</h2>
<p>In some point people started to tell in URW <a href="http://z3.invisionfree.com/UrW_forum/index.php?s=165de95ba5c0c30cbe32ddc45915032f&amp;act=idx" title="URW forum">forums</a> that they are playing URW in Wine (both Mac OS X and Linux). They were happy because it worked. Playing in Wine ain&#8217;t pleasant all the time as it&#8217;s with native game.<br />
Porting SDL 1.2 game to another platform is really nice. It only does what it states. You don&#8217;t have to worry about internals and differences between platforms you just figure out differences and make sure everything is working smooth. Although MSVC is very different compiler C than GCC&#8217;s one. There is even huge difference between Mac OS X libc and Linux libc. Even little bit bumpy ride everything went well at the end and version 3.13 was first Linux and Mac OS X native version released.<br />
Developing multiplatfrom has its&#8217; pains but now Linux and Mac OS X are released in same time as Windows version. I used openSUSE system as base Linux system for the port to Linux. Currently there is openSUSE RPM-version (Which is for Fedora also), Ubuntu/Debian DEB-version/Tar-ball and Mac OS X. Statistics show there is steadily growing phase of people coming from those platform to play URW. Only Ubuntu have currently 64-bit version because there is no demand on openSUSE or Fedora (people with Ubuntu just plays more games!).</p>
<h2>Game ON!</h2>
<p>If you don’t have anything else to do on your Christmas vacation: Go and grab <a href="http://www.unrealworld.fi/urw_linuxmirror.html" title="UnReal World RPG Linux download">UnReal World RPG new 3.18beta3</a> version when it&#8217;s hot hot hot. Find yourself building a cottage and swimming in lake or try to survive the arctic winter.</p>

<p>Welcome in paradise II &#8230; <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
<br />A fresh new version of the FGLRX driver has been released by AMD, and thus packaged and available for all of you.<br />
<br />Next month, AMD promise to release a stable version.
</p>
<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above. All owner of HD2xx and HD4xx are really encouraged to use the free radeon driver (which received a lot of improvement in 3.11)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s 13 and thirteen <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  When I speak about 13.1 it&#8217;s openSUSE version, 13.11 is FGLRX version, don&#8217;t get confused! Oh and 3.11 is the kernel version <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>This is experimental &amp; BETA software, it could fix issues you encountered (FGLRX not working for openSUSE 13.1),<br />
But good reports have been collected around (people having used Sebastian&#8217;s script directly)
</p>
<p>I would like to thanks again Sebastian Siebert for his effort to kept FGLRX in a good shape for all of us.</p>
<h2>Beta Repository</h2>
<p>To make things clear about the status of the drivers, it will not be published under the normal stable repository http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx.<br />
I&#8217;ve created some times ago a beta repository located at <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta">http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta</a>.<br />
The FGLRX 13.11 beta6 and beta 9.4 rpm are released for any openSUSE version from 11.4(Evergreen) to latest 13.1 + Tumbleweed<br />
<br />
Also the signer of package have change and use now the generic builder gpg key at Ioda-Net. (gpg key id 65BE584C)
</p>
<h3>Installing the new repository</h3>
<p>Admitting you&#8217;ve the normal repository named FGLRX, (use zypper lr -d to find the number or name you give it). You have to start by disabling it<br />
so you could fallback to it quickly when new stable version will be published. Open a root console or add sudo at your convenience and issue the following command:</p>
<pre>zypper mr -dR FGLRX</pre>
<p><a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fgrlx-beta/">amd-fglrx-beta</a></p>
<p>To add another repository in the same console as root issue the following command which will install normally the right repository for your distribution</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_`lsb-release -r | awk '{print $2}'` FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p><b>If you are using Tumbleweed</b> use this one</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_Tumbleweed FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Now the update/upgrade process</p>
<pre>zypper dup -r FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Let the system upgrade the package, and try to enjoy the new beta.</p>
<p><span id="more-10174"></span></p>
<h3>Upgrading from the previous beta</h3>
<p>Let the magic of zypper do the work for you</p>
<pre>zypper lu</pre>

<p> will update to the new version</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Only for the brave, Proprietary AMD/ATI Catalyst fglrx 13.10 BETA2 (13.20.11-1) rpm released</h1>
<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above. And adventurous users who know how to deal with troubles.<br />
The majority could easily wait the final release, expected somewhat later even if it take a long time <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
</p>
<p>This is experimental &amp; BETA software, it could fix issues you encountered, but also can eat your kittens. You&#8217;ve been warned !<br />
flgrx build for 3.11 series kernel ( Tumbleweed &amp; 13.1 ).<br />
But this time I&#8217;ve to update the Sebastian script myself, so I consider also the package as beta stage.
</p>
<h3>Installing the new repository</h3>
<p>Admitting you&#8217;ve the normal repository named FGLRX, (use zypper lr -d to find the number or name you give it). You have to start by disabling it<br />
so you could fallback to it quickly. Open a root console or add sudo at your convenience and issue the following command:</p>
<pre>zypper mr -dR FGLRX</pre>
<p>The beta driver is available for 11.4 (evergreen kernel), 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 13.1, Tumbleweed (12.3 based + kernel 3.11) at <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fgrlx-beta/">amd-fglrx-beta</a></p>
<p>To add another repository in the same console as root issue the following command which will install normally the right repository for your distribution</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_`lsb-release -r | awk '{print $2}'` FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p><b>If you are using Tumbleweed</b> use this one</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_Tumbleweed FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Now the update/upgrade process</p>
<pre>zypper dup -r FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Let the system upgrade the package, and try to enjoy the new beta</p>
<p><span id="more-9973"></span></p>
<h2>Release note about 13.10 BETA2 and new repository</h2>
<p>
This BETA Catalyst fglrx version support openSUSE version from 11.4 to 13.1 (new repository) and also Tumbleweed (thus also kernel 3.11x series).<br />
<br />
We create a new repository, to avoid any mix between stable and beta. If you want to try it, you will have to disable the amd-fglrx, and install the<br />
new repository. Also the signer of package have change and use now the generic builder gpg key at Ioda-Net. (gpg key id 65BE584C)
