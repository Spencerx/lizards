				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is for the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members">openSUSE Members!</a></p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/geeko-cast-my-vote.png"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/geeko-cast-my-vote.png" alt="Whatever your opinion, just vote" width="370" height="270" class="alignright size-full wp-image-7546" /></a></p>
<h2>Freedom and Democracy</h2>
<p>Well, I think I have to explain that french title&#8230;</p>
<p>Nah, let&#8217;s not bother and move on <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Part of democracy is that if you don&#8217;t cast your ballot  you have no influence! So don&#8217;t let others decide for you, when you can act!
</p>
<h3>Members, we need your vote!</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re almost 500 members, and this message is for you.<br />
Our freedom to choose our direction and control our project as we wish works only when we vote. As in real world democracies, not voting gets you nowhere. </p>
<h3>So why this reminder? </h3>
<p>Because : <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/07/time-to-vote-on-the-opensuse-strategy/">I want you to vote!</a> </p>
<ul>
<li>
First you read the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Strategy">stategy document</a> (it&#8217;s really quickly done)
</li>
<li>
Think about it (Well, you have 10 days left for that)
</li>
<li>
Take a decision : Can you support that strategy? </p>
<ol>
<li>If 50% of your neurons +1 agree : vote yes</li>
<li>if not : vote no</li>
<li>if you really don&#8217;t know : vote I don&#8217;t know/care.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
Connect to <a href="https://connect.opensuse.org">connect.opensuse.org</a> and cast your vote.
</li>
</ul>
<p>What we need here is to send a strong signal that 99% of our members are alive and care about our project.<br />
Otherwise, why would we bothered to become members, and keep that status, if not to infuence?</p>
<h2>Ideas</h2>
<p>Why not add this signature to your mails you use on ML and/or forums?</p>
<pre>The openSUSE Strategy, I've casted my vote! And you? http://bit.ly/iB2Dzh</pre>
<h2>When?</h2>
<p>Oh come on, I really hope that you&#8217;ve acted before reading this line <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Dead line is 29 June</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adrianschroeter/5101297353/">Yet another foto stream</a> from the openSUSE conference. You see the desktop leads from KDE and Gnome (Cornelius Schumacher and Vincent Untz) giving a talk about the past and future of the free desktop, Stephan Kulow about the future of the distribution, Bernhard Wiedemann about QA testing and so on.</p>
<p>Most important may be the presentation of the openSUSE board (mainly by Pascal Bleser) how they plan to found an independent foundation for openSUSE as non-profit organization. An important rule of that foundation is that it is independent of any company (no majority of Novell here) but can handle sponsoring, partnering and trademark questions.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to thank David that did the major editing on this one.<br />
What do you think? Are we good now to run the next elections with these rules?</p>
<p><span id="more-5397"></span></p>
<h1>openSUSE Board Election Rules</h1>
<h2>Policy</h2>
<h3>Size:</h3>
<p>The board consists of six members: five seats are elected by the community and a chairperson is appointed.</p>
<h3>Term:</h3>
<p>The openSUSE board term is two years.</p>
<h3>Chairperson:</h3>
<p>To provide continuity to the organization, the chairperson shall be appointed and replaced at Novell&#8217;s discretion.</p>
<h3>Election period:</h3>
<p>The election period is normally from 1<sup>st</sup> January to the following 31<sup>st</sup> December.</p>
<h3>Company affiliation:</h3>
<p>To help ensure that the board will always represent a wide part of the community, no single organization or company can control more than 40 per cent of the elected or appointed board seats.</p>
<h3>Good faith:</h3>
<p>Members of the openSUSE board shall act on behalf of all openSUSE contributors in the best interest of the openSUSE project. Although board members may be affiliated with companies or organizations that have an interest in the success of openSUSE, they will not be considered representatives of the companies or organizations with which they are affiliated.</p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<h3>Voting</h3>
<p>Only openSUSE members may vote, each member having one ballot that has one vote per seat to be elected.</p>
<p>The eligible candidates who receive the most votes fill the vacant seats.</p>
<h3>Election Committee:</h3>
<p>The election is run by an Election Committee that consists of at least three openSUSE members.  The Election Committee is appointed for each election by the board.</p>
<h2>Constitution:</h2>
<p>A new board&#8217;s term should start on the first of January, the elections should be finished 14 days before.  In the case of delays, the new board will start 7 days after the election results are published.</p>
<p>Appointed board members or members elected during ad-hoc election will start 7 days after appointment or election results are published.</p>
<h3>Nominations:</h3>
<p>The election committee will take self-nominations, nominations by others and can nominate people for election.  The election committee will contact the nominated people and ask them whether they are willing to stand for election.  These nominations are private until accepted by the nominated people.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Nominations:</h3>
<p>In the event that the number of eligible candidates is less than or equal to the number of vacant seats, the voting period will be delayed by two weeks.  A public message will be sent out to ask again for candidates.</p>
<p>In the event that the number of eligible candidates is still less than or equal to the number of available seats, voting occurs as normal but each candidate needs to have more than 50 per cent yes votes to be elected.</p>
<h3>Tie:</h3>
<p>In the event of a tie for the final seat(s) on the board, the election committee will schedule run-off elections between the tied candidates within one week, with a voting period of one week to resolve the tie.</p>
<p>In the event of a tie during the run-off elections, the newly elected board &#8211; or the previous board, if fewer than 50 per cent of the seats have been filled &#8211; will appoint candidates running in the run-off elections to fill the vacant seats.</p>
<h3>Renewal:</h3>
<p>Approximately half of the board is elected every year. This means that every year, the term of approximately half of the board ends, and the term of the other half ends the year after.</p>
<p>If there have been resignations or removals since the last elections, the term for the new  board members will be adjusted if necessary to ensure that half of the elected board seats &#8211; that means at least two and no more than three out of five &#8211; will have to be filled during the next elections.</p>
<p>To implement this adjustment, the elected board members with the most votes will have a two years term, while the elected board members with the lowest votes will have a one year term. The number of seats with the lowest votes is calculated so that two  of the board seats will have to be filled during the next election</p>
<h3>Appointment:</h3>
<p>The sitting board is allowed to appoint new members to fill a board vacancy caused by one of the following conditions: 1) resignation of a Board member or 2) the removal of a Board member, or 3) death of a Board member, or 4) as part of elections if not enough people are elected.</p>
<p>In the case that some seats do not get filled at an election, the new board will appoint board members as necessary until the next election.</p>
<h3>Ad-hoc elections:</h3>
<p>Instead of opting to appoint more than one board member, the board may opt to call for  new board elections for the vacant seats. These board members will then be elected for the current election period and the next period â thus until 31<sup>st</sup> of December of the next year.</p>
<h2>Eligibility and Validity</h2>
<h3>Eligible candidates:</h3>
<p>Only openSUSE members may stand for election and be elected to the Board.</p>
<h3>Election committee:</h3>
<p>None of the Election Committee can run for or be elected as an openSUSE board member while serving on the Election Committee.</p>
<h3>Eligible voters:</h3>
<p>Only openSUSE members may vote.</p>
<h3>Resignation</h3>
<p>Any person who has resigned from the Board or has been removed from the Board is not eligible for nomination or appointment for or during the next Board election period.</p>
<h3>Restanding:</h3>
<p>openSUSE board members can serve for up to two consecutive election periods. After that they must stand down for at least one election period, but may run again after the one election period break.</p>
<h3>Appointed members:</h3>
<p>Appointed board members are required to stand down and might seek election at the next election.</p>
<h3>Company affiliation:</h3>
<p>In the event that individuals affiliated with a company or organization hold more than 40 per cent of the elected or appointed seats, affiliates from that corporation will be required to resign until fewer than 40 per cent of elected or appointed seats are controlled by that company or organisation.</p>
<p>Individuals affiliated with a company or organization are people who are employees, officers, or members of the board of directors of an organization; or have a significant consulting relationship; or own at least 1 per cent of the equity or debt, or derivatives thereof, of a company.</p>
<h3>Affiliation during election:</h3>
<p>A candidate is not eligible to be voted onto the board if their election would mean that a company or organization hold more than 40 per cent of the elected or appointed seats.  In this case their election and these votes are void.</p>
<h2>Other Rules</h2>
<h3>Removal of Chairperson:</h3>
<p>The elected board members can appeal to Novell to have the chairperson replaced.</p>
<h3>Resignation:</h3>
<p>A member of the board may resign their current position by giving written notice to the chairperson. The board should appoint a new board member or call elections to fill the vacancy.</p>
<h3>Removal:</h3>
<p>In the event of repeated absence without contact, or other serious misconduct or negligence, a Board member may be subject to removal. Before any other process occurs, the Board member in question will be personally contacted by the chairperson to try to resolve the situation. If this contact does not successfully resolve the situation, the Board member in question may be removed by a vote of 2/3s of the other board members. The board should appoint a new board member or call elections to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>Repeated absence includes missing three consecutive board meetings without sending regrets, not answering emails on the board mailing list for more than a month, or missing  more than 10 meetings.</p>
<h3>Forced re-election:</h3>
<p>If 20 per cent or more of the openSUSE members require a new board, an election will be held for the complete elected Board seats.</p>
<h3>Amendment:</h3>
<p>Changes by the election rules can be made by vote of the board where 2/3s or more approve it including the chairperson or by vote of the membership where 2/3 or more of the openSUSE members participating in the vote approve it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A month ago I<a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/08/25/revising-the-board-election-rules/" target="_blank"> presented my first draft</a> for the new openSUSE board election rules and received some good feedback, especially on the opensuse-project mailing list. Since the last version <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2010-09/msg00002.html" target="_blank">presented on the mailing list</a> I reworked the draft some more taking into account the proposal by Henne to remove the split of the elected seats into Novell and non-Novell employees.</p>
<p>So, now the goal of the changes for these rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill the holes that exist in the existing rules</li>
<li>Clarify the existing rules</li>
<li>Open up the project even more with removing the restriction on two members beeing Novell employees.Â  To help ensure that the board will always represent a wide part of the community, I&#8217;ve followed the example of the GNOME foundation to have a rule that only 40 % of the elected board members can work at the same company.<br />
Note that 40 % of 5 elected seats means 2 seats.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;d like to thank Vincent Untz and Alan Clark who helped me with this revision step.</p>
<p>Below is the new draft, for reference I gave each rule a name.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to hear now whether those complete rules are fine or where they need further revision and I&#8217;d also like to see wordsmithing to clarify and improve the rules.</p>
<p><span id="more-5333"></span></p>
<h1>Complete rules for openSUSE Board Elections</h1>
<ul>
<li> Size: The board consists of six members: five seats are elected by the community and additionally an appointed chairperson.</li>
<li>Eligible candidates: Only openSUSE members may run for the Board.<br />
Any previous board member that has previously resigned or has been previously removed from the Board is not eligible for nomination or appointment for or within the next Board election period.</li>
<li>Eligible voters: Only openSUSE members may vote, each member having one ballot that has one vote per seat to be elected.</li>
<li> Election Committee: The election is run by an Election Committee that consists of at least three openSUSE members and gets appointed for each election by the board. None of the Election Committee can run for or be elected as an openSUSE board member while serving on the Election Committee.</li>
<li>Time length: The openSUSE board term is two years. Approximately half of the board is elected every year. This means that every year, the term of approximately half of the board ends, and the term of the other half ends the year after.<br />
To provide continuity to the organization the chairperson shall be appointed and replaced at Novell&#8217;s discretion.Â  The elected board members can appeal to Novell to have the chairperson replaced.</li>
<li>Yearly electing half the board: In case of resignations or removals occured since last elections, the term for elected board members for the current elections will be adjusted to make sure that half of the elected board seats &#8211; that means two out of five &#8211; will have to be filled during the next elections.<br />
To implement this adjustment, the elected seats with the most votes will have a two years term, while the seats with the lowest votes will have a one year term. The number of seats with the lowest votes is calculated so that half of the board seats will have to be filled during the next elections.</li>
<li>Serving time: openSUSE board members can serve for up to two consecutive election periods. After that they must stand down for at least one year, but may be run again after the one year break.</li>
<li>Resignation: A member of the board may resign their current position by giving written notice to the chairperson.</li>
<li>Removal: In the event of repeated absence without contact, or other serious misconduct or negligence, a Board member may be subject to removal. Before any other process occurs, the Board member in question will be personally contacted by the chairperson to try to resolve the situation. If this contact does not successfully resolve the situation, the Board member in question may be removed by a vote of 2/3s of the board members. The board should appoint a new board member.<br />
Repeated absence includes missing three consecutive board meetings without sending regrets, not answering at all to emails or sending regrets for more than 10 meetings.</li>
<li>Appointment: The running board is allowed to appoint new members during their term to fill a board vacancy caused by one of the following conditions: 1) Resignation of a Board member or 2) the removal of a Board member, or 3) as part of elections.<br />
Appointed seats are only appointed until the next election.<br />
Instead of opting to appointmore than one board member, the board may opt to call for a new board election for the vacant seats.</li>
<li>Company affiliation: To help ensure that the board will always represent a wide part of the community, no single organization or company will be allowed to control more than 40% of the elected or appointed board seats, regardless of election results. In the event that individuals affiliated with a corporation or organization hold more than 40% of the seats, affiliates from that corporation will be required to resign until 40% is no longer held.</li>
<li>Individuals affiliated with a company or organization are people who are employees, officers, or members of the board of directors of an organization; or have a significant consulting relationship; or own at least 1% of the equity or debt, or derivatives thereof, of a company.<br />
Notwithstanding the above, members of the openSUSE board shall act on behalf of all openSUSE contributors in the best interest of the openSUSE project. Although board members may be affiliated with companies that have an interest in the success of openSUSE, they will not be considered representatives of companies with which they are affiliated.</li>
<li>Affiliation during election: If more than 40 % of the elected seats would be affiliated with one company (as defined above), elections results shall be adjusted as follows. Individuals who are affiliated with the company which has an excess of representatives shall be removed based on the number of votes they received until such individuals no longer hold a majority of the seats on the board. Other candidates shall replace them, based on the number of votes they received.</li>
<li>Nominations: The election committee will take self-nominations, nominations by others and can nominate people for election.Â  The election committee will contact the nominated people and ask them whether they stand for election.Â  These nominations are private until accepted by the nominated people.</li>
<li>Insufficient Nominations: In the event that the number of eligible candidates is less than or equal to the number of available seats, the voting period will be delayed by two weeks.Â  A public message will be sent out to ask again for candidates.<br />
In the event that the number of eligible candidates is less than or equal to the number of available seats, voting occurs as normal but each candidate needs to have more than 50 per cent yes votes. In case that seats do not get elected, the new board will appoint them.</li>
<li>Constitution: A new board term should start on the first of January, the elections should be finished 14 days before.Â  In the case of delays, the new board will start 7 days after the election results are published.</li>
<li>Tie: In the event of a tie for the final slot on the board, the election committee will schedule run-off elections between the tied candidates within one week, with a voting period of one week to resolve the tie.<br />
In the event of a tie during the run-off elections, the newly elected board &#8211; or the previous board, if all seats are to be filled during the run-off elections &#8211; will appoint candidates running in the run-off elections to fill the remaining slots.</li>
<li>Forced reelection: If 20 per cent of the openSUSE members require a new board election, an election will be held for the complete elected Board seats.</li>
<li>Amendment: Changes by the election rules can be done by vote of the board where 2/3s approve it including the chairperson or by vote of the membership where 2/3 of the openSUSE members approve it.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Open Question</h1>
<p>From Vincent: Should we move to some &#8220;smarter&#8221; voting mechanism. The GNOME Foundation switched to STV <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-announce/2009-March/msg00001.html" target="_blank">[1]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Transferable_Vote" target="_blank">[2]</a>, and I must admit it feels more &#8220;right&#8221;, when voting. This would need some change in the voting software, though.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last years election of seats for the openSUSE board showed that our election rules are not complete.Â  So, before the elections this year start, I propose that we refine the rules and like to start with this post a discussion on how to change them.</p>
<p>I see the following situations not handled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less candidates than seats for a category (Novell/non-Novell)</li>
<li>Equal number of candidates and open seats for a category (Novell/non-Novell)</li>
<li>a board member resigning</li>
<li>a board member disappearing and not engaging in the board</li>
<li>a board member getting hired by Novell or leaves Novell</li>
</ul>
<p>We also need to clarify when the new board constitutes.</p>
<p>We should have a light weight process that is not overly complex and results in endless votes. We vote for people that volunteer their time for the openSUSE project and don&#8217;t get any material benefits for it. So, let&#8217;s keep that in mind when discussing alternatives.</p>
<p><span id="more-5115"></span>Also, currently the board has five elected seats (three non-Novell and two Novell) that get elected, so it could be that we have enough non-Novell candidates but not enough Novell ones etc. To make this text easier, I will not mention this everytime.</p>
<p>I have a first proposal before discussing the situations: The board should be allowed to appoint people to board seats until the next board constitutes.</p>
<p>The alternative would be to have a special election when a seat becomes empty. I fear that this just overly complicates the process.</p>
<p><strong>New rule: Appointment: </strong>In case that board seats will get appointed, they get appointed by the board.Â  Appointed seats are only appointed until the next election.Â  The board can appoint also non-Novell folks on Novell seats and vice-versa.</p>
<p>I suggest also to not only have self-nominations but that people can nominate others &#8211; and the election officials will then ask the nominated person whether they stand up for election.</p>
<p><strong>New rule: Nominations: </strong>The election officials will take self-nominations, nominations by others and can nominate people for election.Â  The election officials will contact the nominated people and ask them whether they stand for election.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Nominations:</h3>
<p>This is a sorry state since it means that not enough openSUSE members are willing to volunteer for the board. In that case, the board should appoint people to join the board and it can put Novell employees on non-Novell seats and vice-versa. With the next election, the seat distribution would be fixed again.</p>
<p><strong>New rule: Insufficient Nominations: </strong>If there are fewer nominees for elected Board seats than required to fill all seats, than the board will appoint these remaining seats.</p>
<p>The question remains what to do with the candidates that volunteer, let&#8217;s handle them in the next case:</p>
<h3>Equal number of candidates and seats</h3>
<p>One option here is to just declare the candidates as new board members.Â  This would be the simplest process.</p>
<p>In other situations, you have a vote of confidence where people give a yes/no vote for the candidates.</p>
<p>One suggestion is a yes/no/abstain vote for the candidates and a candidate needs more yes than no votes to be elected.Â  If somebody does not get elected, the seat gets appointed (see insufficient nominations).<br />
Since it could happen that one category has enough nominations but not the other, the voting would be different for both categories and this makes the whole process complicated.Â  So, I suggest to change the rule to have just more than 50 per cent yes votes.<br />
<strong><br />
New rule: Equal number of candidates of seats: </strong>If there is an equal number of candidates and seats, voting occurs as normal but each candidate needs to have more than 50 per cent yes votes. In case that seats do not get elected, the board will appoint them.</p>
<h3>Board member resigning</h3>
<p>The board should appoint somebody.</p>
<p><strong>New rule: Resigning:</strong> If a board member resigns, the board should appoint a new board member.</p>
<h3>Removal of board member</h3>
<p>This is something that&#8217;s not covered yet as well. What happens if a member disappears virtually? Or what if a board member goes wild?</p>
<p><strong>New rule: Removal:</strong> In the event of repeated absence without contact, or other serious misconduct or negligence, a Board member may be subject to removal. Before any other process occurs, the Board member in question will be personally contacted by the chairperson to try to resolve the situation. If this contact does not successfully resolve the situation, the Board member in question may be removed by unanimous vote of the other members of the Board. The board should appoint a new board member.</p>
<h3>Getting hired by Novell or leaves Novell</h3>
<p>The elected seats are currently either Novell employee seats or non-Novell employee seats. Should a board member resign if he gets fired or hired by Novell?Â  IMO the board should stay functional, the seat was elected.Â  So, again let&#8217;s use a pragmatic approach:</p>
<p><strong>New rule: Change of employment: </strong>The board member will continue to stay<br />
in the board until the end of the term and the next election the distribution of seats gets fixed again.</p>
<h3>Constitution</h3>
<p>There was some confusion when the new term starts, let&#8217;s rectify it.</p>
<p><strong>New rule: Constitution:</strong> A new board term should start on the first of January, the elections should be finished 14 days before.Â  In the case of delays, the new board will start 7 days after the election results are published.</p>
<h3>Amendment</h3>
<p>How can we change the rules?Â  Should the election officials be in charge of them or the board itself?Â  As member of the election officials for the 2009 board election, I propose this change but I suggest that anybody can propose changes but that the board has the final say on them.</p>
<p><strong>New rule: Amendment:</strong> Changes by the election rules can be done by vote of the board where 2/3s approve including the chairperson.</p>
<p>So, once there&#8217;s consensus about my changes, I propose that the board approves them as stated in the Changes of elections.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The current openSUSE Board election rules are available in the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election" target="_blank">wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Did I miss any case in the elections? What would you differently than I proposed?</p>
<p>Btw. I read the Fedora guidelines on Board <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Board_succession_planning " target="_blank">elections</a> and also read also what Jono Bacon wrote in &#8220;The Art of community management&#8221; on governance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Working as a manager sometimes has not so nice days, but tomorrow it will be a really great day. Novell HR has asked me to celebrate a team members ten years anniversary with Novell. That means fun and a present since ten years is a long time, yes, quite a long time for IT industry.</p>
<p><img src="http://en.opensuse.org/images/1/1e/Henne_green_rock.png" alt="Henne Green Rock" align="left" vspace="20">The guy who comes in to S.u.S.E, SuSE and Novell every day since exactly ten years now is <strong><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Hennevogel">Henne</a></strong>. You <em>all</em> know him. He is the guy who helps you with your multimedia problem, the man who finally dries your tears when your package does not build and the one who is first at breakfast after he kicked the last hackers to bed the night before. Of course looking fresh like a new born baby and with the energy of a power plant. Whenever there is work to be done in openSUSE, one can rely on Hennes advice and helping hand.</p>
<p>But that is not all. You might have realized that the openSUSE project is not really ten years old. But maybe it is? Might be that before it was officially set up a few years ago, it was already nested in Hennes heart? He is with openSUSE from day one and before, always following the idea of an open, community driven, vibrant and optimistic openSUSE project with space for opinions, ideas and argues. Over that he never looses focus on a practical compromise that works for all. </p>
<p>He gave very valueable direction in the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Guiding_Principles">Guiding Principle</a> discussion as well as designing the devel project concept in the Build Service which makes external package maintainance possible. Today he gives  important guidance as a member of the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Board">openSUSE Board</a> and is of course one of the strong shoulders in the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Boosters">openSUSE Boosters Team</a>.</p>
<p>I think Henne is one of the persons who make our community valueable and enjoyable. openSUSE is so much benefiting from people like him who take up responsibility and drive things forward.</p>
<p>Henne, in the name of Novell and I guess the whole openSUSE community I like to thank you for all your work so far. I am really looking forward to continuing to do crazy stuff with you. There is a lot more the openSUSE project can achieve over the next couple of decades, great that we have you on board as a green rock <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Community,</p>
<p>for everyone not subscribed (yet) to the opensuse-project mailinglist: here is my candidacy announcement for Board Member of the openSUSE Community Board once again.</p>
<blockquote><p>Community, Election Committee,</p>
<p>I herewith announce my candidacy for Board Member of the openSUSE<br />
Community Board.</p>
<p>My name is Rupert, I&#8217;m 28 and I&#8217;m currently on the home stretch of<br />
studying business administration and electrical engineering at<br />
Darmstadt University of Technology.</p>
<p>I have been involved with the openSUSE Project for several years. I<br />
started using Linux with the release of SUSE Linux 9.1 and became an<br />
active contributor to the Project during my Internship in Product<br />
Management at Novell/SUSE in 2007/2008. In January 2008, I have been<br />
approved as an official openSUSE member. As an employee and afterwards<br />
as a community volunteer, I served as the Project Manager of the<br />
openSUSE forums merge and contributed as a moderator to the openSUSE<br />
community until May 2009. As a Workstudent for Community Architecture,<br />
I worked on several forums-internal projects and contributed to the<br />
openSUSE Weekly Newsletter in 2008/2009.</p>
<p>Currently I&#8217;m involved in the efforts to come up with a sufficient<br />
usability concept for the openSUSE Wiki in co-work with the Wiki- and<br />
Booster Teams.</p>
<p>My contributions to the openSUSE Project so far imho reflect clearly<br />
that I&#8217;m an organizing and coordinating kind of person and that I&#8217;m<br />
focused on the social components of building and growing an<br />
Open-Source Community. From my perspective, having a strong marketing<br />
focus and thus providing sufficient support- and documentation<br />
resources to the end user is just as important to the success of the<br />
openSUSE Project as contributing to the distribution in a developing<br />
capacity actually is. Just to make clear where I&#8217;m coming from.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Rupert</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks a lot for listening,<br />
Rupert</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today at the openSUSE Conference I took the notes of the governance session.Â  We will continue the discussion tomorrow but let me just publish the raw notes as I took them at the meeting without much editing.</p>
<p><em>Notes below:</em></p>
<p><span id="more-2218"></span></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the current state? &#8211; Michael LÃ¶ffler explains:</p>
<ul>
<li>openSUSE Board has no decision power -&gt; can advise, facilitate discussions</li>
<li>99.9 % of decisions are made by maintainer, discussions on mail lists, IRC etc.</li>
<li>Example: Coolo as openSUSE Distro project manager makes many decisions</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Group discussion starts &#8211; I have not written down who said was.</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;re doing good here.</p>
<p>No real written way of how decisions are done.</p>
<p>Reason for meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is process enough?</li>
<li>What needs changes?</li>
<li>How to change?</li>
</ul>
<p>Governance means also talking of roles.Â  Some of the roles have been setup long in the past by Novell.</p>
<p>Compared to other projects: Those do the work, make decisions.</p>
<p>There are some roles that community cannot take part in, e.g. security team.</p>
<p>There might be different kind of governance inside the project.</p>
<p>The distribution is at the heart of the project.Â  There are still some areas that controlled.</p>
<p>Making a decision does not mean that Novell engineers have to implement it.</p>
<p>Do we want to create a new kind of structure?Â  Example: Team of product managers.</p>
<p>Btw. product managers listen to customers/users, see what they get on contribution and optimize process. Similar to a maintainer of an Open Source project that does not program. Linus could be called a product manager.</p>
<p>We want to work together &#8211; forking the distribution when we do not agree is not the solution.</p>
<p>Structures have to be effective.</p>
<p>If people can see that they influence the project and consider part of the project, it is success.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not always clear to people how decisions are made &#8211; and escalated.<br />
We have to describe how this processes work &#8211; clearly and how it works.</p>
<p>There are some decisions of the kind: Good idea, we&#8217;ll accept the contribution and need volunteers to do it.</p>
<p>Btw. what is the technical point of the distribution?Â  What sets it apart from others?Â  Why should I contribute to openSUSE and not to X?</p>
<p>Novell&#8217;s goal with openSUSE:<br />
Ralf Flaxa: To have the technical best melting point of everything where we solve common problems and bring Linux forward with the freedom to have variation.Â  If openSUSE solves technical problems that bring Linux forward, it&#8217;s helpful.<br />
As well private dream: Dream of showing the world that we can make money with Open Source. For openSUSE I love that we embrace others.</p>
<p>Goals for the distribution? We might write some of these up, e.g. we support choice and therefore several desktop environments.<br />
Do we want to focus on getting new contributors &#8211; or on getting new users?</p>
<p>Some goals are implicit.Â  We also need to discuss high-level concepts and question publically &#8211; instead of deciding ourselves.</p>
<p>Are we using the wrong tools for making discussions? Open discussions on mailing lists do not seem to work.Â  There is lots of repeatition of arguments, meta discussions about the discussions etc.</p>
<p>Idea of consolidation: Say &#8220;We&#8217;re soliciting ideas, please send in your thoughts to email@opensuse.org.Â  We&#8217;re collecting input and present a proposal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coolo makes some decisions &#8211; but also facilitates decision making between experts and listens to experts.</p>
<p>Issue is mainly not making decisions but conflict resolution.<br />
Should we empower the openSUSE Board for this?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at what other Open Source projects do.</p>
<p>Concepts of Core Teams?</p>
<p>Different ways of questions: Present your own opinion and ask for comments &#8211; or present choices?</p>
<p>Often the same people diverge every discussion.Â  Sometimes somebody just has to say &#8220;Shut up!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Idea 2 for discussion: Create wiki page with a proposal and ask others people to refine the wiki page.Â  Inform mailing list about proposal and ask for improvements and say you ignore comments on mailing lists.</p>
<p>Leadership in discussions is missing!Â  We need to lead to the discussions more.Â  Several proposals on how to create new concepts.</p>
<p>What happens if consensus can not be reached?Â  Should we empower the board for this?Â  What to do if the board does not come to a decision?Â  Should the board refuse to make decisions? Are there other questions that the board should decide on?Â  Should the board delegate decisions?</p>
<p>People should feel responsible for their area and make decisions &#8211; and respect others.</p>
<p>How to continue the discussion and move forward?</p>
<ul>
<li> Take it to the board and ask the board for a proposal to present on a mailing list?</li>
<li> Let the members vote on the enaction of the final proposal and ratify it.Â  Otherwise we might have the board proposing a change and empowering themselves.</li>
<li> Discussion on a mailing list where only openSUSE members can participate and trolls get removed?</li>
</ul>
<p>Idea: Invite interested folks to board discussion.Â  Interested were Michael Meeks, Zonker, Rupert HorstkÃ¶tter, Jan Weber, Roger Whittaker, Vincent Untz, Cornelius Schumacher, Kalman Kemenczy.</p>
<p>Followup tomorrow, Henne to reserve room and lead discussion.</p>
<p>AI: AJ to blog this (done with this post).</p>
