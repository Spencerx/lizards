				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has long been a challenge to use MS Silverlight based websites on linux systems.  Especially in The Netherlands this is a big hurdle as many (&gt;80%) of the secondary school websites that pupils must use to communicate with their school (for homework, marks, etc) are equipped with Silverlight.  Yes, really&#8230; <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Fortunately at the end of August 2013 I discovered <a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html#section_1_4" title="An incredible solution ">pipelight</a>, a very smart idea to use MS Silverlight based website natively on Linux.  The problem was however to find a working pipelight package for openSUSE.  As there was none, I decided to build one myself using the incredible <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/">openSUSE Build Service</a>.  It was quite a quest to obtain a working package, but due to very good cooperation with the pipelight developers, I&#8217;m now able to present a working pipelight package to the openSUSE community.  Oh, and while working on the package I reported a bug via the bug report system, that was solved and published via an rpm package within 1 hour after reporting it (that was during out of office hours).  Indeed within 1 hour after reporting the problem it was; accepted, investigated, analysed, fixed, tested, handed over to me, packaged, tested and published!  The amazing world of Open Source Software!</p>
<p>Pipelight works okay for the following sites (<a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html#section_5">among many others</a>): arte, LOVEFiLM, Netflix, Magister based NL schoolwebsites, WATCHEVER, etc.  View the complete list on the <a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html">pipelight website</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html#section_1_4">installation instructions</a> are on the pipelight website.  Be aware though, that pipelight requires the wine package that is provided via the home:rbos:pipelight repository.  With any other wine package, pipelight will (very likely) not work.  If you rely on your currently installed wine package and installed MS applications and are unsure that the wine package provided via the home:rbos:pipelight repository will leave your currently in use MS applications untouched: don&#8217;t install pipelight (or only after making very good backups).  You can always start by installing pipelight in a virtual machine.</p>
<p>Have fun with pipelight.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Michal Hrušecký</em> has been helping out on maintaining Factory in shape and shares his experiences.</p>
<p>Factory is development version of openSUSE and it is where the next openSUSE is taking form. Hundreds of packagers send packages into Factory to be integrated as a part of the new release and many more use Factory for testing or for their daily work. Thus it is really important to keep Factory rolling and usable. Everybody knows that <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2007/08/09/people-of-opensuse-stephan-kulow/">Coolo</a> is the Factory master and he does everything to make next openSUSE be the best ever. But keeping factory in shape is really complicated and stressing task. There are dozens of request everyday and each one of them can potentially break something. So Factory can always use a pair of extra hands and for some time I have been one of them. I&#8217;d like to give you some insight in what we do, working on keeping Factory building and working.<span id="more-9497"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://openbuildservice.org"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9543" alt="obs-logo" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/obs-logo.png" width="243" height="101" /></a></p>
<h2>Keep it building</h2>
<p>With a constant influx of newer and cooler versions of libraries and tools it is easy to break existing applications with shiny new software. So we always have some build failures in Factory. Part of our job is to resolve them because if it doesn&#8217;t build, you can&#8217;t test nor ship it. As developer, you may have seen submit request in various projects in OBS fixing builds for Factory. Everyday I take a look at a number of build failures, investigate why they are not building in Factory and try to do something about it.</p>
<p>For example new version of the GNU C Compiler (GCC) is quite often more strict on includes, requiring developers to be more verbose about the exact internal and external libraries there applications require to be build. What used to build now doesn&#8217;t, because you are missing include files. The older GCC let you slip by, but now you have to fix it, build failure by build failure. Another example is GTK which keeps deprecating old API functions and you have to keep up and replace them with correct counterparts from the new API. Sometimes even the kernel changes API and third party modules stops building. All these errors will get eventually resolved upstream (if upstream is alive), but as we follow upstream quite closely before feature freeze, it may happen that we are first facing these issues because sometime we are the first ones who tried to compile this software using new GTK or the new GCC. Of course, we attempt to get these fixes back upstream and share them with other distributions where appropriate!</p>
<div id="attachment_9541" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/600px-Factory_workflow.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9541" alt="Factory_workflow" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/600px-Factory_workflow-300x176.png" width="300" height="176" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image depicting the Factory Workflow</p></div>
<h2>Test it</h2>
<p>Another important part of working on a better Factory is testing. If everything builds, we&#8217;re happy. You might have heard the saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> if it builds, ship it!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>(un)fortunately, this isn&#8217;t Coolo&#8217;s idea of how the world works. In Factory, things not only have to build, but also work. Oh, AND conform to some stringent requirements. Here comes into play what most of our team was working on in the past months and what was <a href="For example new version of gcc is quite often more strict on includes.  What used to build now doesn't, because you are missing include files. Older gcc let you slip by, but now you have to fix it. Or GTK keeps deprecating old API functions and you have to keep up and replace them with correct counterparts from new API. Sometimes even kernel changes API and third party modules stops building. All these errors will get eventually resolved upstream (if upstream is alive), but as we follow upstream quite closely before feature freeze, it may happen that we are first facing these issues because sometime we are the first ones who tried to compile this software using new GTK and gcc.">described last week &#8211; openQA</a>. openQA tests the latest builds of openSUSE Factory, tries to install them and run tests on some applications as well. But still, not all failures from automatic testing are real failures. Sometimes application just changed too much to be covered by test. So from time to time we go through failing openQA tests, try to reproduce them, figure out what went wrong and either fix it or report it via bugzilla to the corresponding maintainer.</p>
<h2>Concluding</h2>
<p>Each of these tasks is relatively small (check why this test failed, fix this package to build with new gcc) but what makes it hard is the number of packages we&#8217;ve got and the constant inflow of changes. Also, because the issue can be all over the place, each and every one requires you to dive into an entirely new package, with new and interesting quirks, build systems, languages and more. It is a great way of getting to know a wide variety of packages and applications, finding a gem every now and then. But also implies a lot of work.</p>
<p>Things will get slower and more stable after feature freeze when we will spend more time in the testing part, while today we mostly work on the build part. Still, Factory has to keep building, without that it becomes impossible to keep developing openSUSE. What we do, fixing these build errors, it might not be super visible, but it matters a lot.</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>On a related note, we&#8217;d like to (re) introduce weekly Factory statistics! It has been a while since we had those, once upon a time courtesy of AJ and Guido. Now, Alberto provides them. Here you go, the top-fifteen contributors to openSUSE Factory last week (from Sunday June 2nd to to Sunday June 9th):<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/factory-tested.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-9447 alignright" alt="factory-tested" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/factory-tested.png" width="217" height="232" /></a>Today, we&#8217;ve got for you an introduction of the teams&#8217; work on openQA by <em>Alberto Planas Domínguez</em>.</p>
<p>The last 12.3 release was important for the openSUSE team for a number of reasons. One reason is that we wanted to integrate QA (Quality Assurance) into the release process in an early stage. You might remember that this release had UEFI and Secure Boot support coming and everybody had read the scary reports about badly broken machines that can only be fixed replacing the firmware. Obviously openSUSE can&#8217;t allow such things to happen to our user base, so we wanted to do more testing.<span id="more-9440"></span></p>
<h2>Testing is hard</h2>
<p>Testing a distribution seems easy at first sight:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the ISO of the last build and put it on the USB stick</li>
<li>Boot from the USB</li>
<li>Install and test</li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>
<div id="attachment_9476" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/factory.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9476 " title="testing in progress!" alt="testing in progress!" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/factory_crop-300x169.png" width="300" height="169" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">testing in progress!</p></div>
<p>But look a bit further and you will see that, actually, only the installation process itself is already a <a title="free dictionary on combinatorial" href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/combinatorial" target="_blank">combinatorial</a> problem. In openSUSE we have different mediums (DVD, KDE and Gnome Live images, NET installation image and the new Rescue image), three official architectures (32 and 64 bits and ARMv7), a bunch of different file systems (Ext3 / Ext4, Btrfs, LVM with or without encryption, etc.), different boot loaders (GRUB 2, LILO, SHIM). <em>Yeah</em>&#8230; Even without doing the math you see that for only this small subset of variables we have hundreds of possible combinations. And this is just the installation process, we are not talking about the various desktops and applications or hardware like network interfaces or graphics cards here.</p>
<h3>And we want continuous testing</h3>
<p>And that is only the final testing round! If we want to be serious about QA and testing, we need to run the full test battery for every build that OBS generate for us, with extra attention to the Milestones, Betas and RC which are scheduled in the release road-map.</p>
<p>We can of course attempt to optimize our testing approach. For example, if I am the maintainer of a package and I sure that my last version is working perfectly in Factory (because I tested it in my system, of course), do I really need to test this application again and again when a new ISO build is released? Unfortunately, we can <em>not</em> take a shortcut here. As Distribution, our job is integration and so we need to test the entire product again for every build. A single change in an external library or in any other package which I depend on can break my package. The interdependencies for a integration project of the size of openSUSE are so intricate that is faster to run the full test again. With this approach we are avoiding regressions in our distribution, important during development. But also a lot of work &#8211; who has time for all this testing?</p>
<h2>OpenQA as a solution</h2>
<p>For us, there&#8217;s no doubt about it: <a href="http://openqa.opensuse.org/">openQA</a> is the correct tool for this. openQA is already used to test certain parts of openSUSE, and has shown itself as a competent tool to test other distributions like Fedora or Debian.</p>
<p>To experiment with openQA, the openSUSE team decided to launch a local implementation of the tool and start feeding it with 12.3 builds. But we soon ran into some limitation in the way we can express desired test outcomes in openQA and we got ideas on how to improve the detection of failed and succeeded tests. We also discovered that some tests in openQA had the bad habit of starting to work in <em>“monkey mode”</em> by simply sending commands and events to the virtual machine without checking if those interaction have expected behavior or not, losing track of the test progress.</p>
<p>openQA has the great benefit of being open source so we can improve its usefulness for testing Factory. Moreover, the original author of openQA, Bernhard M. Wiedemann, is a very talented developer and works for SUSE so upstream is very close to us. So we decided to start hacking!<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/stopwatch.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9448 alignright" alt="stopwatch" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/stopwatch-227x300.png" width="113" height="150" /></a></p>
<h2>openQA work</h2>
<p>After the 12.3 release we decided to spend some quality time improving openQA as a team project. This was managed using the public Chili (a Redmine fork) project management web application. We published all the milestones, tasks, goals and documentation in the <a href="http://board.opensuse.org/projects/openqa-improvement/">&#8220;openQA improvement project&#8221;</a>. The management side of this project perhaps needs a different post, but for now we can say that we tried to develop it as open as possible. Of course you can get the full code from <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/">the openSUSE github account</a>.</p>
<h2>Major changes</h2>
<p>The main architectural changes implemented during our 10 weeks of coding on openQA can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration with openCV</li>
<li>Replacement of PPM graphic file format with PNG</li>
<li>Introduced needles; test with better control of the state</li>
<li>A proper job dispatcher for new test configurations</li>
<li>Better internal scheduler, with snapshots and a way to skip tests</li>
<li>Improvement in the communication between webUI and the virtual machine</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_9481" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/needleeditor.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9481" title="The Needle editor in action" alt="The Needle editor in action" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/needleeditor_crop-300x204.png" width="300" height="204" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Needle editor in action</p></div>
<h3>openCV brings robust testing</h3>
<p>The tests in openQA need to check what is happening in the virtual (or real) machine to verify results, and the main source of information is the output of the screen. This information is usually a graphical information: we can instruct QEMU (or Vbox) to retry screenshots in a periodic basis. To properly evaluate a test outcome we need to find some kind of information in those pictures, and for that we use the computer vision library openCV.</p>
<p>With this library we can implement different methods to find relevant sections of the image, like buttons, error messages or text. These are then used for the test to get information about the actual environment of the installation process and to find out if the test passed or not. Previously, checksums on the images were used to determine outcomes. This led to many false positives (tests failing too often) due to simple theming and layout changes &#8211; a single pixel changing broke the test. openCV support was introduced earlier by Dominik Heidler to enable testing with noisy analogue VGA capture and we extended the usage of openCV matching to be more versatile, powerful and easier to use (both for test-module-writers and for maintainers).<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63567936@N00/4210167891/" title="Headless Horse by Perry McKenna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2632/4210167891_dbfe5d540f_n.jpg" width="320" height="192" class="alignright" alt="Finding the needle"></a></p>
<h3>Introducing needles</h3>
<p>openQA has been modified to use PNG instead of PPM files to store images to test against, improving performance but also enabling openQA to store certain meta-data within the images. This brings us to the most important improvement in openQA: the introduction of the needle. A needle is an PNG image with some meta-data associated (a JSON document). This meta-data describes one or multiple &#8216;regions of interest&#8217; (RoI) in the original image which can be used by the test to match the current screenshot. For example, if the installation is in the partition manager and we send the expected keystrokes to set Btrfs as our default file system, we can assert that this option is currently set using a needle where the RoI has the correct check box marked. In other words: we create a needle with an area covering the check box. The system will search this area in the current screen to assert that there is, somewhere, a check box with this label correctly marked. And will use openCV to make sure that slight changes in theming or layout will not result in a failed test.</p>
<p>The needle concept is really powerful. When a test uses needles with multiple RoI&#8217;s, the system will try to match every area in the current screenshot, in whatever position. There are areas that can be excluded, and areas that can be processed using an OCR (Tesseract) to extract and match text from them.</p>
<p>Thanks to needles we can now create tests that are always in a known state and they can inform complex decisions about the next step to take. For example, we can have tests that can detect and respond correctly when a sudo prompt appears suddenly, or where an error dialog appears when is not expected. More important, we can detect errors more quickly, aborting the installation process and pointing the developer to the exact error.</p>
<h3>Faster testing with snapshots</h3>
<div id="attachment_9477" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/results.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9477" title="Test result overview" alt="Test result overview" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/results_crop-300x172.png" width="300" height="172" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Test result overview</p></div>
<p>We also implemented a way to create snapshots of the virtual machine status. This is useful if we want to retry some tests, or start the test-set from a specific test. For example, if we are testing the Firefox web browser, we want to avoid all the installation tests, and maybe some of the tests related with other applications. With this snapshot feature, we can load the virtual machine in the state where Firefox can be tested immediately.</p>
<h3>Improved web UI</h3>
<p>The final major area of focus has been on the web interface. We designed a set of dialogs to create and edit needles. Using this editor we can also see why the current tests are failing, comparing the current screenshot with the different expected needles from the tests.</p>
<p>Also, from the web interface we can control the execution of the virtual machine: signaling to stop or continue the execution. This is a feature that is useful when we want to create needles in an interactive way.</p>
<h2>Upstream</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re very happy that Bernhard has helped us, both with work and advice, to get these changes implemented. Several improvements were integrated in the <a href="https://github.com/bmwiedemann/os-autoinst/">current production version of openQA</a> and most of the more invasive ones are part of the V2 branch of openQA. We plan to sit together with Bernhard to see about deploying V2 to <a title="openQA in action" href="http://openqa.opensuse.org/results/" target="_blank">openqa.opensuse.org</a> for testing factory as soon as possible.</p>
<p>There is still work to be done. For example, for full integration testing we need to expand on the current ability which allows to run the tests on real hardware. This will for example allow testing graphics and network cards. Also, writing proper documentation is on the todo list. For those interested in helping out putting openQA to work and keeping the quality of our distribution high, the <a title="openSUSE Conference site" href="http://conference.opensuse.org" target="_blank">openSUSE Conference</a> will feature a workshop on creating tests for Factory.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone using the Open Build Service in the last couple of weeks will notice how hopelessly overloaded it is.  I blame the ARM lads <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> .  But there is something that we should all do as responsible community members: delete or disable your old stuff.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just spent 15 minutes going through my Open Build Service <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Awstephenson">home:wstephenson</a> project, deleting unfinished works in progress, finished branches that were never deleted, inherited repositories in branched projects that aren&#8217;t relevant to the tweaks I&#8217;m making, and I think I&#8217;ve saved about 100 repositories for the OBS scheduler to recalculate and look at publishing.</p>
<p>Time for you to spring clean too?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am happy to announce that i succeded in compiling wxRuby 2.0.1 on my Buildservice account and it is available to be installed in just one click for openSUSE 12.2 and 12.3.</p>
<p>wxRuby is an old but working library based on wxWidgets toolkit, till some day ago the dependency from SWIG 1.3.38 and some small errors raised during the manual compilation, made the use of this library the worst nightmare for beginners who was looking for a fast approach to GUI based programming in Ruby.</p>
<p>After some day spent to investigate about a possible upgrade of the SWIG dependency to the current 2.0 version, i produced some patches to fix this and the other annoying compiling errors, and finally, thanks to the Buildservice infrastructure, a wxRuby RPM compiled from sources with the relative patches are now availables for all openSUSE users!</p>
<p>As far i googled this should be the first distro to have a precompiled and working wxruby gem among its repositories (being compiled from sources the gem is generated for 32 and 64 bits architecture from Buildservice itself), so Rubyists take a look on software.opensuse.org, select the package coming from my home project account and enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy,</p>
<p>the openSUSE on ARM team was quite busy the last few weeks with getting openSUSE 12.3 for AArch64 (ARM64, also called ARMv8) ready. At the time of this post, we have finished around 4100 packages (out of ~ 6000) of openSUSE 12.3 built for AArch64, the ARM 64bit platform. With those successfully built packages, we&#8217;re also able to build a regular openSUSE image for you to try and run in the ARMv8 System emulator (ARMv8 Foundation Model).</p>
<p>This is a huge achievement and milestone for us, thanks to lots of helpful hands within openSUSE. Just to put this into perspective: This is not a minimal system with a couple of toolchain packages. It is also not an embedded variant of a Linux environment. No, this is the <strong>full featured, standard openSUSE distribution</strong> as you&#8217;re used to, ported to AArch64, up and running. We have built it based on (slightly newer versions of) standard openSUSE 12.3 packages, and the changes are mostly already merged back into openSUSE Factory. For all we know it’s also more successful package builds than any other Linux distribution has on AArch64! If you’d like to see the status yourself, please check out <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=devel%3AARM%3AAArch64%3A12.3">the OBS repository we created for this</a>.</p>
<p>As an open distribution, it is important to make contributions easy and we worked hard to enable others to participate in our effort. We extended OBS to automatically spawn a <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/tools/models/fast-models/foundation-model.php">Foundation Model</a> virtual machine when you want to build for aarch64. This works remotely on the OBS server as well as locally using osc build. More information on this is available on the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM/AArch64">respective wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>So, dive right into it:  Get the image and start with openSUSE on AArch64 by following our wiki page: <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM/AArch64">https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM/AArch64</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, came across <a title="x2go home" href="http://x2go.org">x2go</a> packages maintained by<a title="People of openSUSE" href="http://news.opensuse.org/2009/04/23/people-of-opensuse-jan-engelhardt/"> Jan Engelhardt</a> for openSUSE and other distributions on <a title="X11:RemoteDesktop:x2go" href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=X11:RemoteDesktop:x2go">open build service</a>. As <a title="Li-f-e" href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">openSUSE Education Li-f-e</a> has great <a title="LTSP home" href="http://ltsp.org">LTSP</a> integration thanks to<a title="KIWI-LTSP on openSUSE wiki" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI-LTSP"> KIWI-LTSP</a>, I decided to check out how x2go can fit in with this existing thin-client computing solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;x2go is an open (<acronym title="GNU General Public License">GPL</acronym>/AGPL) source “server based computing” project. Combining the advantages of existing systems it features ease of use, performance and scalability. x2go provides you with access to your desktop &#8211; from within your own network and via the internet. x2go is not limited to particular hardware, it supports a variety of devices and architectures.&#8221; -from their website.</p>
<p>Some of the features/benefits of x2go that are not available on LTSP are:</p>
<p>* Remote login from within local lan and internet from any OS<br />
* Session persistence, you can disconnect session from one client and continue where you left off from any other client<br />
* Low bandwidth usage<br />
* Session sharing with other users<br />
<span id="more-9029"></span><br />
Apart from these, x2go also supports sound redirection via pulseaudio, folder sharing for access to local disks similar to LTSP.</p>
<p>I would personally still prefer LTSP session in local network, and as x2goserver and LTSP server can coexist on same server we can choose x2goclient to connect over the internet and log in using LTSP in local lan.</p>
<p>Here is how to run x2go as kiosk session by PXE booting a thin-client/PC/laptop.</p>
<p>* Install <a title="kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go" href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go">kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go</a> on openSUSE Edu Li-f-e or 12.2 via <a title="Install via 1-click" href="http://software.opensuse.org/ymp/server:ltsp/openSUSE_12.2/kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go.ymp">1-click from here</a>.<br />
* Run <code>kiwi-ltsp -ln openSUSE_12_2_x2go</code> as root to create KIWI-LTSP image that is used for PXE booting clients, (this step requires fast internet connection and about 250M download)<br />
* Run <code>kiwi-ltsp -c</code> to configure required services<br />
* Add the following to<strong><em> /srv/tftpboot/KIWI/root.default/etc/lts.conf</strong></em>  under [default] for all clients or under [MA:CA:DD:RE:SS] for a particular client and boot up the client, openSUSE_12_2_x2go will be available at the end of boot menu.<br />
<code><br />
        SCREEN_07=kiosk<br />
        KIOSK_EXE="/usr/bin/x2goclient --no-menu --maximize --link=lan --geometry=fullscreen --thinclient --haltbt --no-session-edit  --add-to-known-hosts"<br />
        KIOSKUSER=x2goclient<br />
 </code></p>
<p>You can also have normal LTSP session on tty8 along with this by adding <code>SCREEN_08=ldm</code>. To connect to the server from non-thin-client install and run x2goclient.</p>
<p>You can simply poweroff the client without the need to disconnect or do normal shutdown.</p>
<p>Note: this method of using x2go is just for testing and development purpose, you can use x2goserver and x2goclient in a standalone mode without kiwi-ltsp bits. Nothing additional than installing x2goserver package is needed to setup the server, except firewall should allow access to ssh port(22). </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>as I already I wrote in an earlier post the last week I worked on implementing osc2&#8242;s &#8220;request&#8221;<br />
command. In order to create a new submit request the user has to run<br />
<code>osc request create --submit api://src_project/src_package api://tgt_project</code><br />
What&#8217;s still needed is a way to specify a revision of the src_package. It isn&#8217;t possible<br />
to introduce a &#8220;&#8211;revision &#8221; option because it&#8217;s possible to specify multiple submit<br />
actions for a request (so we can&#8217;t distinguish to which &#8211;submit action a revision<br />
belongs to).<br />
Finally I implemented darix&#8217; cool idea: simply use a svn-like syntax:<br />
<code>osc request create --submit api://src_project/src_package@rev api://tgt_project</code></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi,</p>
<p>here’s a small summary of the 12th (coding) week. The last week I continued<br />
the work on the new user interface. As a result the &#8220;request&#8221; command is more<br />
or less implemented. Yesterday I pushed the current code and it&#8217;s also possible<br />
to play around with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>checkout the code <a href="http://https://github.com/openSUSE/osc2">[1]</a></li>
<li>cd osc2/osc/cli</li>
<li>export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/osc2</li>
<li>python cli.py -h (for more information)</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:<br />
In order to list a request it is sufficient to run<br />
&#8220;python cli.py request api://your_project&#8221; (Note: all https requests are<br />
_insecure_ &#8211; so far the certificate etc. is not checked).</p>
<p>Some implementation details:<br />
In my last mail/post I described how a new (sub)command can be specified<br />
so I&#8217;ll leave out the details here.<br />
In the following I&#8217;ll shortly explain how the arguments specified by the<br />
user at the commandline are passed to a function (which does the actual<br />
work &#8211; like listing the requests).</p>
<pre><code>
class RequestList(CommandDescription, Request):
    """
    ...
    """
    cmd = 'list'
    args = 'api://project?/package?'
    opt_user = Option('U', 'user', 'list only requests for USER')
    func = call(request.list)
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see the project and package parameters are optional. After<br />
the parsing process a so called &#8220;info&#8221; object is returned which encapsulates<br />
the specified arguments. Assume the user runs &#8220;request list api://test_prj&#8221;<br />
then the info object has the following attributes:</p>
<pre><code>
    info.apiurl = the default apiurl
    info.project = 'test_prj'
    info.package = None
</code></pre>
<p>The question is how can we pass this data to the request.list function?<br />
A simple (and naive) approach would be to simply pass the &#8220;info&#8221; object<br />
to the request.list function that is &#8220;list&#8221; has the following signature<br />
&#8220;def list(info)&#8221;. As a consequence inside the method we always have to<br />
use &#8220;info.project&#8221;, &#8220;info.package&#8221; etc. which is a bit awkward &#8211; at least<br />
for parameters which are quite frequently used in the method definition.</p>
<p>So it would be nice if there&#8217;s a way to pass frequently used parameters<br />
directly to the method (that is they&#8217;re declared as formal parameters<br />
in the method definition) and infrequently used parameters can still be<br />
accessed via the info object. Exactly like this it is currently<br />
implementend in osc2.</p>
<p>So the following signatures would be correct for our example:</p>
<pre><code>
    def list(project, package, info)
    def list(project, package, user)
    def list(project, package, user, info)
    def list(project, info)
    def list(info, project)
    def list(project)  # using the info object is not mandatory
    def list()  # quite useless...
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>Invalid signatures:</p>
<pre><code>
    def list(prj, pkg, info)
    def list(foo, info)
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>So it is up to the developer how to define the signature of the<br />
request.list function &#8211; it is not completely dictated by osc:)</p>
