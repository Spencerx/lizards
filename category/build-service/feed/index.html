				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2014/02/07/some-news-from-the-trenches/">previous summary</a>, we talked about some basic research and some ground work to build on. This time we have some first exciting results!</p>
<h3>openQA</h3>
<p>Last week we rearranged the repository a little bit, creating a <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/openQA/tree/devel">new branch called &quot;devel&quot;</a> where all the exciting (and not so exciting) changes are taking place. Our little Factory <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>The main difference between this branch as master is that, as you could read in the previous blog, the devel branch is openQA build on <a href="http://mojolicio.us">Mojolicious</a>, a nice web development framework. And having a proper web framework is starting to show its benefits: we have openID login available! Unfortunately the current openSUSE openID provider is a little bit weird, so it doesn&#8217;t play well with our tool yet, but some others are working and openSUSE accounts will be the next step. Having working user accounts is necessary to be able to start defining permissions and to make openQA truly multiuser. And to be able to deploy the new version on a public server!</p>
<p>The other main focus of this week has been internal polishing. We have revamped the database layout and changed the way in which the different openQA components communicate with each other. The openQA functionality is spread out over several parts: the workers are responsible of actually executing the tests in virtual machines reporting the result after every execution; some client utilities are used to load new ISO images and similar tasks and, finally, we have the one openQA Server to rule them all. Until now, the communication between the server and the other components was done using <a href="http://json-rpc.org/">JSON-RPC</a> (a lightweight alternative to XML-RPC). We have dropped JSON-RPC in favor of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST-like</a> API with just JSON over plain HTTP. This change allowed us to implement exactly the same functionality in a way that is simpler, perfectly supported by any web framework, natively spoken by browsers and easier to authenticate (using, for example, plain HTTP authentication or openID). This is also the first step to future integration with other services (think OBS, as the ultimate goal is to use openQA to test staging projects).</p>
<p>But, who tests the tester? openQA is growing and changing quite fast so we have continued with the task of creating a good testing infrastructure to tests openQA itself to make sure that all our changes do not result in breakage. We only have a few tests right now, but we now have a solid foundation to write more and more tests.</p>
<h3>Staging and package manipulation</h3>
<p>In the last blog post we told you we were investigating a code test suite to test the abilities of a osc plugin we are writing. osc is the commandline tool for handling the Open Build Service, and this plugin is meant to help with the administration of staging projects. We&#8217;ve been thinking about how to move forward with the testing part as we want to make sure the functionality works as advertised. More important, we write tests to make sure that our additions and changes do not break existing functionality. We have started merging functionality from various scripts handling staging thingies and rings we had into this plugin. This is partially done so we can do basic staging project tasks! We can take a request (be it submit or delete) and put it to test in a staging project. We can also move packages between staging projects and we have a simple YAML in project descriptions to indicate what packages and what requests are there.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/openqa-staging.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/openqa-staging-300x102.png" alt="We're all green!" width="250" height="85" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10576" /></a><br />
Coolo already started using the plugin for some tasks, so you can <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/subprojects/openSUSE:Factory:Staging">see pretty titles</a> and <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/openSUSE:Factory:Staging:C">metadata</a> in staging projects descriptions. Not impressive enough? Let me provide you a good headline:</p>
<p><b>Thanks to staging projects, no single regression have been introduced this year in the core of Factory</b></p>
<p>You can enjoy a more detailed description in <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2014-02/msg00252.html">this announcement</a> written by coolo to the Factory mailing list and have some visual joy in the included screenshot (genuine pr0n for QA engineers).</p>
<p>Last but not least, we also did some cleanup of the sources in the repo and of course we added more tests (as functionality grows). And there has been work on other parts of the plugin, like taking rings into account.</p>
<h3>Result</h3>
<p>We already have some useful functionality which we are going to expand and build on. Not that much to show yet, but we are progressing towards our goal. You can follow our progress either in the way of tasks (<a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqav3">openQA</a> and <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/stagings">staging projects</a>) or just follow our commit history on github (again for both <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/openQA/tree/devel">openQA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory">staging plugin</a>).</p>
<p>We are very much looking forward to feedback and thoughts &#8211; these changes aim to make Factory development easier and thus we need to hear from all you!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you might know, we are focusing our development efforts in two fronts, namely <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2014-01/msg00317.html">openQA</a> and <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2014-01/msg00278.html">staging projects</a>. As we just started we don&#8217;t have fireworks for you (yet) but we did some solid ground work that we are going to build upon.</p>
<h3>Working on openQA</h3>
<p>We are organizing our daily job in openQA into highly focused sprints of two weeks. The focus of the first sprint was clear: cleanup the current codebase to empower future development and lower the entry barrier for casual contributors, which can be translated as &#8220;cleaning our own mess&#8221;. We created <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/67">some tasks in progress</a>, grouped in a version with a surprising and catchy name: Sprint 01.</p>
<h4>Got my mojo workin&#8217;</h4>
<p>Up to now, openQA web interface was written using just a bunch of custom CGI scripts and some configuration directives in Apache. We missed a convenient way to access to all the bell and whistles of modern web development and some tools to make the code more readable, reliable and easier to extend and test. In short, we missed a proper web development framework. We evaluated the most popular Perl-based alternatives and we finally decided to go for <a href="http://mojolicio.us/">Mojolicious</a> for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides all the functionality we demand from a web framework while being lightweight and unbloated.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s stated as a &#8220;real time framework&#8221; which, buzzwords apart, means that is designed from the ground to fully support Comet (long-polling), EventSource and WebSockets. Very handy technologies for implementing some features in openQA.</li>
<li>It really &#8220;feels&#8221; very close to <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>, which makes Ruby on Rails     developers feel like at home. And we have quite some Rails developers hanging around, don&#8217;t we? Just think about OBS, software.o.o, WebYast, progress.o.o, OSEM, the TSP app&#8230;
<li>Mojolicious motto is &#8220;web development can be fun again&#8221;. Who could resist to that?</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ve now reached the end of the sprint and we already have something that looks exactly the same than what we had before, but using Mojolicious internally. We are very happy with the framework and we are pretty confident that future development of openQA will be easier and faster than ever. OpenQA has mojo!</p>
<h4>The database layer in openQA</h4>
<p>Another part that we worked on during first sprint was the database layer. The user interface part of openQA use a SQLite database to store the jobs and workers registered in the system. The connection between the code and the database was expressed directly in SQL using a simple API.</p>
<p>We have replaced this layer with another equivalent that uses an ORM (Object-relational mapping) in Perl (<a href="http://www.dbix-class.org/">DBIx::Class</a>). Every data model in openQA is now a true object that can be created, copied and moved between the different layers of the application. Quite handy.</p>
<p>To make sure we don&#8217;t forget anything, we created a bunch of tests covering the whole functionality of the original code, running this test suite after each step of the migration. In this way we have achieved two goals: we now have a simple way to share and update information through the whole system and we can migrate very easily to a different database engine (something that we plan to do in the future).</p>
<h3>What to do with staging</h3>
<p>Over the time, coolo had accumulated quite some scripts that helped him with Factory. Most of them are actually related to something we are doing right now: the staging projects. So in the end we basically migrated all relevant ones to <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory">github</a> and one by one we are merging their functionality to staging plugin. We also experimented with test frameworks that we could use to test the plugin itself, selected few and we even have a first test! The final plan is to have the whole plugin functionality covered with a proper test suite, so we will know when something breaks. Currently, there is a lot of mess in our repo and the plugin itself need big cleanup, but we are working on it.</p>
<h3>Contributions are welcome</h3>
<p>If you want to help but wonder where to start, we identified tasks that are good to dive into the topic and named them &#8220;easy hacks&#8221;: mostly self contained tasks we expect to have little effort but we lack the time to do right now. Just jump over the list for <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/73">openQA</a> or <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/69">staging projects</a>.</p>
<p>For grabbing the code related to staging project, you only need to clone the <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory">already mentioned repository</a>. The openQA code is spread in several repositories (<a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/openQA">two</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse">three</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst-needles-opensuse">four</a>), but setting up your own instance to play and hack is a piece of cake using <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/openQA">the packages</a> available in OBS (built automatically for every git push).</p>
<p>If you simply want to see what we are doing in more detail, take a look at progress.o.o, we have both <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqav3">openQA</a> and <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/stagings">Staging projects</a> there.</p>
<p>We are having a lot of fun, and we encourage you to join us!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we stated in our communication over the time, our team&#8217;s main focus for foreseeable future is Factory and how to manage all those contributions. Goal is <strong>not</strong> to increase the number of SRs that is coming to Factory, but to make sure we can process more and to make sure we see even well hidden consequences to make sure that Factory is &#8220;stable&#8221; and &#8220;usable&#8221;.</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sprayg-263x300.jpg" alt="sprayg" width="263" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10485" />
<p>Not really part of our current sprints, but something that will hopefully help us is <i>spec-cleaner</i> that Tomáš Chvátal and Tomáš Čech were working on lately during their free time/hackweek. What is it trying to address? Currently, there are some packaging guidelines, but when you write a spec file for your software, you still have plenty of choices. How do you order all the information in the header? Do you use curly brackets around macros? Do you use macros? Which ones do you use and which not? Do you use binaries in dependencies? Package config? Perl symbols? Package names? There is <i>format_spec_file</i> obs service that tries to unify a little bit the coding style but leaves quite some of the stuff up to you. Not necessarily a bad thing, but if you have to compare changes and review packages that are using completely different coding styles the process becomes harder and slower.</p>
<p><i>spec-cleaner</i> is <i>format_spec_file</i> taken to another level. It tries to unify coding style as much as it can. It uses consistent conventions, makes most of the decisions mentioned previously for you and if you already decided for one way in the past, it will try to convert your spec file to follow the conventions that it specifies. It&#8217;s not enforcing anything, it&#8217;s standalone script and therefore you don&#8217;t have to be worried that you spec file will be out of your control. You can run it, verify the result (actually, you should verify the results as there might still be some bugs) and commit it to OBS. If we all do it, our packages will all look more alike and it will be easier to read and review them.</p>
<p>How to try it? How to help? Well, code is on <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/spec-cleaner">GitHub</a> and packages are in <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Tools/spec-cleaner">OBS</a>. You may have a version of it in your distribution, but that one is heavily outdated (even the 13.1 version), so add openSUSE:Tools repo and try the version from there.</p>
<pre>zypper ar -f obs://openSUSE:Tools/openSUSE_13.1 openSUSE-Tools
zypper in spec-cleaner</pre>
<p>You can then go to some local checkout and try what changes does it propose for your spec file. Easiest way is to just let it do stuff by calling it and taking a look at changes afterwards.</p>
<pre>spec-cleaner -p -i *.spec
osc diff</pre>
<p>If it works, great, we will have more unified spec files. If it doesn&#8217;t, file a  <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/spec-cleaner/issues">bug</a> <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has long been a challenge to use MS Silverlight based websites on linux systems.  Especially in The Netherlands this is a big hurdle as many (&gt;80%) of the secondary school websites that pupils must use to communicate with their school (for homework, marks, etc) are equipped with Silverlight.  Yes, really&#8230; <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Fortunately at the end of August 2013 I discovered <a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html#section_1_4" title="An incredible solution ">pipelight</a>, a very smart idea to use MS Silverlight based website natively on Linux.  The problem was however to find a working pipelight package for openSUSE.  As there was none, I decided to build one myself using the incredible <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/">openSUSE Build Service</a>.  It was quite a quest to obtain a working package, but due to very good cooperation with the pipelight developers, I&#8217;m now able to present a working pipelight package to the openSUSE community.  Oh, and while working on the package I reported a bug via the bug report system, that was solved and published via an rpm package within 1 hour after reporting it (that was during out of office hours).  Indeed within 1 hour after reporting the problem it was; accepted, investigated, analysed, fixed, tested, handed over to me, packaged, tested and published!  The amazing world of Open Source Software!</p>
<p>Pipelight works okay for the following sites (<a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html#section_5">among many others</a>): arte, LOVEFiLM, Netflix, Magister based NL schoolwebsites, WATCHEVER, etc.  View the complete list on the <a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html">pipelight website</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html#section_1_4">installation instructions</a> are on the pipelight website.  Be aware though, that pipelight requires the wine package that is provided via the home:rbos:pipelight repository.  With any other wine package, pipelight will (very likely) not work.  If you rely on your currently installed wine package and installed MS applications and are unsure that the wine package provided via the home:rbos:pipelight repository will leave your currently in use MS applications untouched: don&#8217;t install pipelight (or only after making very good backups).  You can always start by installing pipelight in a virtual machine.</p>
<p>Have fun with pipelight.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Michal Hrušecký</em> has been helping out on maintaining Factory in shape and shares his experiences.</p>
<p>Factory is development version of openSUSE and it is where the next openSUSE is taking form. Hundreds of packagers send packages into Factory to be integrated as a part of the new release and many more use Factory for testing or for their daily work. Thus it is really important to keep Factory rolling and usable. Everybody knows that <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2007/08/09/people-of-opensuse-stephan-kulow/">Coolo</a> is the Factory master and he does everything to make next openSUSE be the best ever. But keeping factory in shape is really complicated and stressing task. There are dozens of request everyday and each one of them can potentially break something. So Factory can always use a pair of extra hands and for some time I have been one of them. I&#8217;d like to give you some insight in what we do, working on keeping Factory building and working.<span id="more-9497"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://openbuildservice.org"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9543" alt="obs-logo" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/obs-logo.png" width="243" height="101" /></a></p>
<h2>Keep it building</h2>
<p>With a constant influx of newer and cooler versions of libraries and tools it is easy to break existing applications with shiny new software. So we always have some build failures in Factory. Part of our job is to resolve them because if it doesn&#8217;t build, you can&#8217;t test nor ship it. As developer, you may have seen submit request in various projects in OBS fixing builds for Factory. Everyday I take a look at a number of build failures, investigate why they are not building in Factory and try to do something about it.</p>
<p>For example new version of the GNU C Compiler (GCC) is quite often more strict on includes, requiring developers to be more verbose about the exact internal and external libraries there applications require to be build. What used to build now doesn&#8217;t, because you are missing include files. The older GCC let you slip by, but now you have to fix it, build failure by build failure. Another example is GTK which keeps deprecating old API functions and you have to keep up and replace them with correct counterparts from the new API. Sometimes even the kernel changes API and third party modules stops building. All these errors will get eventually resolved upstream (if upstream is alive), but as we follow upstream quite closely before feature freeze, it may happen that we are first facing these issues because sometime we are the first ones who tried to compile this software using new GTK or the new GCC. Of course, we attempt to get these fixes back upstream and share them with other distributions where appropriate!</p>

<h2>Test it</h2>
<p>Another important part of working on a better Factory is testing. If everything builds, we&#8217;re happy. You might have heard the saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> if it builds, ship it!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>(un)fortunately, this isn&#8217;t Coolo&#8217;s idea of how the world works. In Factory, things not only have to build, but also work. Oh, AND conform to some stringent requirements. Here comes into play what most of our team was working on in the past months and what was <a href="For example new version of gcc is quite often more strict on includes.  What used to build now doesn't, because you are missing include files. Older gcc let you slip by, but now you have to fix it. Or GTK keeps deprecating old API functions and you have to keep up and replace them with correct counterparts from new API. Sometimes even kernel changes API and third party modules stops building. All these errors will get eventually resolved upstream (if upstream is alive), but as we follow upstream quite closely before feature freeze, it may happen that we are first facing these issues because sometime we are the first ones who tried to compile this software using new GTK and gcc.">described last week &#8211; openQA</a>. openQA tests the latest builds of openSUSE Factory, tries to install them and run tests on some applications as well. But still, not all failures from automatic testing are real failures. Sometimes application just changed too much to be covered by test. So from time to time we go through failing openQA tests, try to reproduce them, figure out what went wrong and either fix it or report it via bugzilla to the corresponding maintainer.</p>
<h2>Concluding</h2>
<p>Each of these tasks is relatively small (check why this test failed, fix this package to build with new gcc) but what makes it hard is the number of packages we&#8217;ve got and the constant inflow of changes. Also, because the issue can be all over the place, each and every one requires you to dive into an entirely new package, with new and interesting quirks, build systems, languages and more. It is a great way of getting to know a wide variety of packages and applications, finding a gem every now and then. But also implies a lot of work.</p>
<p>Things will get slower and more stable after feature freeze when we will spend more time in the testing part, while today we mostly work on the build part. Still, Factory has to keep building, without that it becomes impossible to keep developing openSUSE. What we do, fixing these build errors, it might not be super visible, but it matters a lot.</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>On a related note, we&#8217;d like to (re) introduce weekly Factory statistics! It has been a while since we had those, once upon a time courtesy of AJ and Guido. Now, Alberto provides them. Here you go, the top-fifteen contributors to openSUSE Factory last week (from Sunday June 2nd to to Sunday June 9th):<br />

<p>The last 12.3 release was important for the openSUSE team for a number of reasons. One reason is that we wanted to integrate QA (Quality Assurance) into the release process in an early stage. You might remember that this release had UEFI and Secure Boot support coming and everybody had read the scary reports about badly broken machines that can only be fixed replacing the firmware. Obviously openSUSE can&#8217;t allow such things to happen to our user base, so we wanted to do more testing.<span id="more-9440"></span></p>
<h2>Testing is hard</h2>
<p>Testing a distribution seems easy at first sight:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the ISO of the last build and put it on the USB stick</li>
<li>Boot from the USB</li>
<li>Install and test</li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>
<div id="attachment_9476" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/factory.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9476 " title="testing in progress!" alt="testing in progress!" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/factory_crop-300x169.png" width="300" height="169" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">testing in progress!</p></div>
<p>But look a bit further and you will see that, actually, only the installation process itself is already a <a title="free dictionary on combinatorial" href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/combinatorial" target="_blank">combinatorial</a> problem. In openSUSE we have different mediums (DVD, KDE and Gnome Live images, NET installation image and the new Rescue image), three official architectures (32 and 64 bits and ARMv7), a bunch of different file systems (Ext3 / Ext4, Btrfs, LVM with or without encryption, etc.), different boot loaders (GRUB 2, LILO, SHIM). <em>Yeah</em>&#8230; Even without doing the math you see that for only this small subset of variables we have hundreds of possible combinations. And this is just the installation process, we are not talking about the various desktops and applications or hardware like network interfaces or graphics cards here.</p>
<h3>And we want continuous testing</h3>
<p>And that is only the final testing round! If we want to be serious about QA and testing, we need to run the full test battery for every build that OBS generate for us, with extra attention to the Milestones, Betas and RC which are scheduled in the release road-map.</p>
<p>We can of course attempt to optimize our testing approach. For example, if I am the maintainer of a package and I sure that my last version is working perfectly in Factory (because I tested it in my system, of course), do I really need to test this application again and again when a new ISO build is released? Unfortunately, we can <em>not</em> take a shortcut here. As Distribution, our job is integration and so we need to test the entire product again for every build. A single change in an external library or in any other package which I depend on can break my package. The interdependencies for a integration project of the size of openSUSE are so intricate that is faster to run the full test again. With this approach we are avoiding regressions in our distribution, important during development. But also a lot of work &#8211; who has time for all this testing?</p>
<h2>OpenQA as a solution</h2>
<p>For us, there&#8217;s no doubt about it: <a href="http://openqa.opensuse.org/">openQA</a> is the correct tool for this. openQA is already used to test certain parts of openSUSE, and has shown itself as a competent tool to test other distributions like Fedora or Debian.</p>
<p>To experiment with openQA, the openSUSE team decided to launch a local implementation of the tool and start feeding it with 12.3 builds. But we soon ran into some limitation in the way we can express desired test outcomes in openQA and we got ideas on how to improve the detection of failed and succeeded tests. We also discovered that some tests in openQA had the bad habit of starting to work in <em>“monkey mode”</em> by simply sending commands and events to the virtual machine without checking if those interaction have expected behavior or not, losing track of the test progress.</p>
<p>openQA has the great benefit of being open source so we can improve its usefulness for testing Factory. Moreover, the original author of openQA, Bernhard M. Wiedemann, is a very talented developer and works for SUSE so upstream is very close to us. So we decided to start hacking!<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/stopwatch.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9448 alignright" alt="stopwatch" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/stopwatch-227x300.png" width="113" height="150" /></a></p>
<h2>openQA work</h2>
<p>After the 12.3 release we decided to spend some quality time improving openQA as a team project. This was managed using the public Chili (a Redmine fork) project management web application. We published all the milestones, tasks, goals and documentation in the <a href="http://board.opensuse.org/projects/openqa-improvement/">&#8220;openQA improvement project&#8221;</a>. The management side of this project perhaps needs a different post, but for now we can say that we tried to develop it as open as possible. Of course you can get the full code from <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/">the openSUSE github account</a>.</p>
<h2>Major changes</h2>
<p>The main architectural changes implemented during our 10 weeks of coding on openQA can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration with openCV</li>
<li>Replacement of PPM graphic file format with PNG</li>
<li>Introduced needles; test with better control of the state</li>
<li>A proper job dispatcher for new test configurations</li>
<li>Better internal scheduler, with snapshots and a way to skip tests</li>
<li>Improvement in the communication between webUI and the virtual machine</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_9481" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/needleeditor.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9481" title="The Needle editor in action" alt="The Needle editor in action" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/needleeditor_crop-300x204.png" width="300" height="204" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Needle editor in action</p></div>
<h3>openCV brings robust testing</h3>
<p>The tests in openQA need to check what is happening in the virtual (or real) machine to verify results, and the main source of information is the output of the screen. This information is usually a graphical information: we can instruct QEMU (or Vbox) to retry screenshots in a periodic basis. To properly evaluate a test outcome we need to find some kind of information in those pictures, and for that we use the computer vision library openCV.</p>
<p>With this library we can implement different methods to find relevant sections of the image, like buttons, error messages or text. These are then used for the test to get information about the actual environment of the installation process and to find out if the test passed or not. Previously, checksums on the images were used to determine outcomes. This led to many false positives (tests failing too often) due to simple theming and layout changes &#8211; a single pixel changing broke the test. openCV support was introduced earlier by Dominik Heidler to enable testing with noisy analogue VGA capture and we extended the usage of openCV matching to be more versatile, powerful and easier to use (both for test-module-writers and for maintainers).<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63567936@N00/4210167891/" title="Headless Horse by Perry McKenna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2632/4210167891_dbfe5d540f_n.jpg" width="320" height="192" class="alignright" alt="Finding the needle"></a></p>
<h3>Introducing needles</h3>
<p>openQA has been modified to use PNG instead of PPM files to store images to test against, improving performance but also enabling openQA to store certain meta-data within the images. This brings us to the most important improvement in openQA: the introduction of the needle. A needle is an PNG image with some meta-data associated (a JSON document). This meta-data describes one or multiple &#8216;regions of interest&#8217; (RoI) in the original image which can be used by the test to match the current screenshot. For example, if the installation is in the partition manager and we send the expected keystrokes to set Btrfs as our default file system, we can assert that this option is currently set using a needle where the RoI has the correct check box marked. In other words: we create a needle with an area covering the check box. The system will search this area in the current screen to assert that there is, somewhere, a check box with this label correctly marked. And will use openCV to make sure that slight changes in theming or layout will not result in a failed test.</p>
<p>The needle concept is really powerful. When a test uses needles with multiple RoI&#8217;s, the system will try to match every area in the current screenshot, in whatever position. There are areas that can be excluded, and areas that can be processed using an OCR (Tesseract) to extract and match text from them.</p>
<p>Thanks to needles we can now create tests that are always in a known state and they can inform complex decisions about the next step to take. For example, we can have tests that can detect and respond correctly when a sudo prompt appears suddenly, or where an error dialog appears when is not expected. More important, we can detect errors more quickly, aborting the installation process and pointing the developer to the exact error.</p>
<h3>Faster testing with snapshots</h3>
<div id="attachment_9477" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/results.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9477" title="Test result overview" alt="Test result overview" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/results_crop-300x172.png" width="300" height="172" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Test result overview</p></div>
<p>We also implemented a way to create snapshots of the virtual machine status. This is useful if we want to retry some tests, or start the test-set from a specific test. For example, if we are testing the Firefox web browser, we want to avoid all the installation tests, and maybe some of the tests related with other applications. With this snapshot feature, we can load the virtual machine in the state where Firefox can be tested immediately.</p>
<h3>Improved web UI</h3>
<p>The final major area of focus has been on the web interface. We designed a set of dialogs to create and edit needles. Using this editor we can also see why the current tests are failing, comparing the current screenshot with the different expected needles from the tests.</p>
<p>Also, from the web interface we can control the execution of the virtual machine: signaling to stop or continue the execution. This is a feature that is useful when we want to create needles in an interactive way.</p>
<h2>Upstream</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re very happy that Bernhard has helped us, both with work and advice, to get these changes implemented. Several improvements were integrated in the <a href="https://github.com/bmwiedemann/os-autoinst/">current production version of openQA</a> and most of the more invasive ones are part of the V2 branch of openQA. We plan to sit together with Bernhard to see about deploying V2 to <a title="openQA in action" href="http://openqa.opensuse.org/results/" target="_blank">openqa.opensuse.org</a> for testing factory as soon as possible.</p>
<p>There is still work to be done. For example, for full integration testing we need to expand on the current ability which allows to run the tests on real hardware. This will for example allow testing graphics and network cards. Also, writing proper documentation is on the todo list. For those interested in helping out putting openQA to work and keeping the quality of our distribution high, the <a title="openSUSE Conference site" href="http://conference.opensuse.org" target="_blank">openSUSE Conference</a> will feature a workshop on creating tests for Factory.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just spent 15 minutes going through my Open Build Service <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Awstephenson">home:wstephenson</a> project, deleting unfinished works in progress, finished branches that were never deleted, inherited repositories in branched projects that aren&#8217;t relevant to the tweaks I&#8217;m making, and I think I&#8217;ve saved about 100 repositories for the OBS scheduler to recalculate and look at publishing.</p>
<p>Time for you to spring clean too?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am happy to announce that i succeded in compiling wxRuby 2.0.1 on my Buildservice account and it is available to be installed in just one click for openSUSE 12.2 and 12.3.</p>
<p>wxRuby is an old but working library based on wxWidgets toolkit, till some day ago the dependency from SWIG 1.3.38 and some small errors raised during the manual compilation, made the use of this library the worst nightmare for beginners who was looking for a fast approach to GUI based programming in Ruby.</p>
<p>After some day spent to investigate about a possible upgrade of the SWIG dependency to the current 2.0 version, i produced some patches to fix this and the other annoying compiling errors, and finally, thanks to the Buildservice infrastructure, a wxRuby RPM compiled from sources with the relative patches are now availables for all openSUSE users!</p>
<p>As far i googled this should be the first distro to have a precompiled and working wxruby gem among its repositories (being compiled from sources the gem is generated for 32 and 64 bits architecture from Buildservice itself), so Rubyists take a look on software.opensuse.org, select the package coming from my home project account and enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy,</p>
<p>the openSUSE on ARM team was quite busy the last few weeks with getting openSUSE 12.3 for AArch64 (ARM64, also called ARMv8) ready. At the time of this post, we have finished around 4100 packages (out of ~ 6000) of openSUSE 12.3 built for AArch64, the ARM 64bit platform. With those successfully built packages, we&#8217;re also able to build a regular openSUSE image for you to try and run in the ARMv8 System emulator (ARMv8 Foundation Model).</p>
<p>This is a huge achievement and milestone for us, thanks to lots of helpful hands within openSUSE. Just to put this into perspective: This is not a minimal system with a couple of toolchain packages. It is also not an embedded variant of a Linux environment. No, this is the <strong>full featured, standard openSUSE distribution</strong> as you&#8217;re used to, ported to AArch64, up and running. We have built it based on (slightly newer versions of) standard openSUSE 12.3 packages, and the changes are mostly already merged back into openSUSE Factory. For all we know it’s also more successful package builds than any other Linux distribution has on AArch64! If you’d like to see the status yourself, please check out <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=devel%3AARM%3AAArch64%3A12.3">the OBS repository we created for this</a>.</p>
<p>As an open distribution, it is important to make contributions easy and we worked hard to enable others to participate in our effort. We extended OBS to automatically spawn a <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/tools/models/fast-models/foundation-model.php">Foundation Model</a> virtual machine when you want to build for aarch64. This works remotely on the OBS server as well as locally using osc build. More information on this is available on the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM/AArch64">respective wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>So, dive right into it:  Get the image and start with openSUSE on AArch64 by following our wiki page: <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM/AArch64">https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM/AArch64</a>.</p>

(by default &#8220;buildlog_strip_time&#8221; is set to False).<br />
The &#8220;&#8211;strip-time&#8221; option is also supported by the &#8220;localbuildlog&#8221; and &#8220;remotebuildlog&#8221;<br />
commands.</p>
