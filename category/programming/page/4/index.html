            <p>openSUSE Conference 2017 is coming! And as we flight there (literally, one third of the YaST team is in a plane right now typing this), we wanted to inform our beloved readers on what we did in the previous three weeks.</p>
<p>So here is our report, brought to you by airmail!</p>
<h3>Bugfixes, bugfixes everywhere</h3>
<p>Leaving openSUSE Tumbleweed aside, The YaST team is currently working to deliver SLE12-SP3, openSUSE Leap 42.3, SLE15, openSUSE Leap 15, SUSE CaaSP 1.0 and Kubic (more about Kubic later). Three of them are already in beta phase, which means they are being extensively tested by several parties and in many scenarios, hardware platforms and possible configurations. That amount of manual testing always result in several bug being discovered, no matter how much we try to have some automated tests for the most common cases.</p>
<p>Many of the bugs our testers are finding are related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization">internationalization and localization</a>, mainly texts in the UI that are always displayed in English, despite the system been configured (or being installed) in a different language.</p>
<p>But, of course, other kind of bugs are also being found. For example, our hardware detection component (<code>hwinfo</code>) was not able to deal with some new machines, making the installation experience everything but pleasant.</p>
<p>As a result, a significant amount of the YaST team manpower during this sprint was targeted to squash those annoying bugs. Which doesn&#8217;t mean we didn&#8217;t have time for some interesting new features and improvements.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: unlock encrypted devices</h3>
<p>Once again, our new storage system comes with news. Now it&#8217;s able to detect and unlock preexisting encrypted devices during the hard disks probing step, raising you a new pop-pup dialog to ask for the corresponding device password. After unlocking the devices, all your installed systems will be accessible for upgrade and, moreover, the LVM volumes allocated over encrypted devices will be activated.</p>
<p>The new storage stack is expected to debut in SLE15 (and, thus, openSUSE Leap 15), but the functionality can already be tested, for both the installation and upgrade processes, with the <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng#trying-the-installation-process">StorageNG test ISOs</a>.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/luks-activation.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/luks-activation-300x225.png" alt="Luks activation in StorageNG" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12510" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/luks-activation-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/luks-activation-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/luks-activation.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>The storage reimplementation &amp; AutoYaST &#8211; a love story</h3>
<p>But the happiest news coming from the new storage stack during this sprint is it&#8217;s marriage with AutoYaST. The new automatic partitioning proposal (that is, the &#8220;Guided Setup&#8221;) is now integrated with AutoYaST.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new software architecture, AutoYaST users will be able to override every single partitioning setting from the control file.</p>
<pre>
&lt;profile xmlns="http://www.suse.com/1.0/yast2ns" xmlns:config="http://www.suse.com/1.0/configns"&gt;
  &lt;general&gt;
    &lt;storage&gt;
      &lt;!-- Override settings from control file  --&gt;
      &lt;try_separate_home config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/try_separate_home&gt;
      &lt;proposal_lvm config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/proposal_lvm&gt;
    &lt;/storage&gt;
  &lt;/general&gt;
&lt;/profile&gt;
</pre>
<p>So you can easily switch on/off LVM, use a separate partition for <code>/home</code>, enable/disable snapshots, enable/disable Windows resizing, etc. All that, still relying on the automated storage proposal to iron the details up. Something that is not possible with the current version of AutoYaST without being forced to define explicitly every partition and LVM volume.</p>
<p>But the simplest way to use the new libstorage proposal is to not define any setting at all in the AutoYaST configuration file. In that case, the partitioning proposal code will do the complete job, installing a new system with the default options.</p>
<p>Of course, before integrating the new storage stack into the upcoming SLE15, the AutoYaST support have to go one step further. Apart from using and configuring the proposal, it must be possible to define a completely custom setup including partitions, LVM volumes, software RAID devices and so on through the corresponding <code>&lt;partitioning&gt;</code> section of the AutoYaST profile. So we used this sprint to sketch a plan to make that possible in the following months, analyzing all the scenarios and configurations supported by AutoYaST and looking for the best way to support them using the existing <code>yast2-storage-ng</code> infrastructure. The outcome of that effort is <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng/blob/master/doc/autoyast.md">this detailed document</a> and a list of tasks (<a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2007/march/glossary-of-scrum-terms#1130">PBIs</a> in Scrum jargon) for the upcoming sprints. So be prepared for more news in this regard.</p>
<h3>Automatic Cleanup of Snapshots created by Rollback</h3>
<p>So far the user had to ensure that snapshots created by rollbacks got deleted to avoid filling up the storage. This process has now been automated. During a rollback, Snapper now sets the cleanup algorithm to “number” for the snapshot corresponding to the previous default subvolume and for the backup snapshot of the previous default subvolume. This enhanced behavior will be available in SLE12-SP3 and openSUSE Leap 42.3. For more information take a look at <a href="http://snapper.io/2017/05/10/automatic-cleanup-after-rollback.html">the more detailed post</a> in the Snapper blog.</p>
<h3>Helping to bring the CaaSP fun to openSUSE</h3>
<p>For several sprints already we have been presenting features targeted to SUSE CaaSP, the Kubernets-powered solution for managing containers. Many of those features and custom configurations live in a package called <code>yast2-caasp</code>, originally targeted to this great upcoming product built on top of the SLE12-SP2 codebase.</p>
<p>But now the package is also available for Tumbleweed-based systems by request of the <a href="https://github.com/kubic-project">Kubic project</a>. Kubic will be the openSUSE <i>alter ego</i> of SUSE CaaSP, that is, a Container as a Service Platform based on openSUSE and Kubernetes. As with any other YaST component, the exact same source code will shared by the SUSE product and its openSUSE brother.</p>
<h3>Improved UX when an invalid registration URL is provided</h3>
<p>Humans make mistakes, but when the mistakes are made entering some option in<br />
the installation command line, it usually means that a reboot of the machine is be needed to fix them.</p>
<p>That was the case for the registration URL (<code>regurl</code>) option. In the provided address was malformed the installation just stopped. During this sprint we have added an early check of that URL which allows the user to reenter it and continue with the installation. Something that obviously improves the user experience.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wrong-regurl1.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wrong-regurl1-300x225.png" alt="Invalid regurl handling in normal installation" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12511" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wrong-regurl1-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wrong-regurl1-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wrong-regurl1.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>In case of an autoinstallation (AutoYaST), the error is reported and the steps to get installer updates and to register the system are skipped.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wrong-regurl2.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wrong-regurl2-300x225.png" alt="Invalid regurl handling in autoinstallation" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12512" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wrong-regurl2-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wrong-regurl2-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/wrong-regurl2.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>There is still room for more improvements, allowing the user to also modify the URL in other scenarios. For example, for an URL with a valid format but that points to an unreachable server. But in those cases is not so straightforward to identify the culprit of the problem. It would make no sense to annoy the user with a recurring pop-up to change the registration URL if the root of the issue is not the URL but a incorrect network configuration.</p>
<h3>Translations and Interpolations</h3>
<p>As mentioned at the begining of this post, we recently got quite some bug reports about missing translations. Although some of them were really caused by bugs in the YaST code, others were a consequence of a buggy Ruby <code>rxgettext</code> script which collects the translatable strings from the Ruby source code. The bug is known by the Ruby-GetText developers, but it&#8217;s unclear when (or whether) it will be fixed.</p>
<p>The problem is that the tool cannot collect the translatable strings from interpolations. For example it cannot find the &#8220;foo&#8221; string from this string literal: <code>"#{_("foo")}"</code>. As a result, that string is missing in the resulting POT file and cannot be translated by the SUSE or openSUSE localization teams.</p>
<p>As a workaround, we fixed the YaST code to not use the translations inside interpolations. We also <a href="https://yastgithubio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/localization/#interpolations">documented</a> the possible problems when mixing translations a interpolations and their solution.</p>
<p>And talking about new developer oriented documentation&#8230;</p>
<h3>Security Tips for YaST Developers</h3>
<p>YaST runs with the administrator privileges (<code>root</code>) and therefore we have to be aware of the possible security issues in the code. During this sprint we published a document with a short summary of security tips for YaST developers.</p>
<p>If you are programming an YaST module you should definitely read it, but it might be interesting also for other programmers as many mentioned issues are generic, not tight only to YaST.</p>
<p>The document is available online <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-tips/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>See you at the conference</h3>
<p>That&#8217;s all for this sprint report. We have many more things in the oven, be we didn&#8217;t manage to finish them during the sprint, so they will have to wait for the next report. Meanwhile we hope to see many of you at the <a href="https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC17">openSUSE Conference 2017</a>. There will be a whole workshop about modern YaST development, a summary with the more relevant news in the last year of YaST development, talks about the new superb yast2-configuration-management module, about our continuous delivery infrastructure and about how we use Docker to deliver YaST&#8230; And, of course, also many other interesting content like the awesome presentation from Thorsten Kukuk about the brand new openSUSE Kubic we mentioned earlier. And even more important, a lot of fun!</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12465">our latest sprint report</a>, we promised you an extra post about the technology we have been using lately to manipulate configuration files. The wait is over! Here is the fine text by <a href="https://github.com/mchf">Michal Filka</a> explaining everything you need to know to get started with CFA.</p>
<h2>Welcome to CFA</h2>
<p>As you should know if you follow our blog (we make sure to repeat it once in a while 😉 ), YaST was converted some time ago from a custom programming language called YCP to Ruby. However, this conversion was done on language basis. Some old design decisions and principles stayed, like the usage of <a href="https://yastgithubio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/#system-configuration-repository-scr">SCR</a> for accessing the underlying system.</p>
<p>SCR was designed together with YaST. It uses concept of &#8220;agents&#8221; for accessing configuration files. These agents contains a description of configuration file using their own format. Moreover SCR offers location transparency. You can e.g. work with a file in the execution system or in a chrooted environment. However, this piece of code is proprietary and limited by the inconsistent quality level of the agents. In addition, is written in C++, developed only within SUSE and, sadly, not very well designed. You cannot easily use just the parser or the location transparency functionality. You always have to go through the complete SCR stack when parsing an input. Similarly, when using location transparency (setting a new location), all subsequent SCR calls are influenced by this. For this and some other reasons we decided to replace the proprietary SCR with something else. That&#8217;s how we started to develop and use &#8220;Configuration files API&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/config-files-api/config_files_api">Configuration files API</a> (CFA) is a library written in ruby intended for accessing various configuration files. You can download it from <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/cfa">rubygems.org</a>. It is also available as <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Leap:42.3/rubygem-cfa">a set of RPM packages for OpenSUSE 42.3 in the build service</a>. It is structured into several layers and creates an internal abstraction of configuration file. It has been designed and developed in SUSE&#8217;s YaST team. However this time it uses (or can use) third party parsers. CFA provides location transparency for the parser on the bottom layer and unified API for application on the top one. Location transparency is achieved by a well known File interface, so you can use any piece of code which implements that interface. Implementing support for a new parser is a bit more complicated. In the worst case you may need to implement a ruby bindings. However, once you have a bindings, implementing other pieces which are needed to get things working in the CFA&#8217;s stack is simple.</p>
<p>Lets go through the layers in details.</p>
<h2>Bottom layer: File access</h2>
<p>Is responsible for the direct access to the configuration files. In the simplest case it accesses local configuration files using the <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/File.html">Ruby&#8217;s File class</a>, but it can be adapted to access remote, chrooted or memory files too. The developer simply needs to provide a file handler implementing the corresponding <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> methods. Handlers for files in memory and in a chrooted environment are already provided by the common CFA framework.</p>
<h2>Middle layer: Parser</h2>
<p>This layer parses the configuration file which was loaded by the underlying layer. It knows the structure of the file and transforms it into an abstract representation. The library typically uses external tool for parsing, like <a href="http://augeas.net/">Augeas</a>. So, if the external tools has specific requirements, they have to be satisfied to get things working. For example if Augeas is used, you need to provide a proper lens (Augeas jargon for a file format descriptor) to parse the particular configuration file.</p>
<h2>Top layer: Configuration file model</h2>
<p>The last layer creates a model of the configuration file &#8211; an semantically meaningful API for accessing the configuration from an application. It basically creates &#8220;an abstraction on top of another abstraction&#8221;. It means that it unifies the usage of the various tools that can be used for accessing and parsing the configuration files.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The model described above has some handicaps, mainly affecting the developers but visible sometimes for the users as well.</p>
<h3>Feed the beast</h3>
<p>If you are a developer planning to use CFA to manipulate a given configuration file, you must take into account that you will need to provide the parser and satisfy all its requirements. So, you at least have to know which parser is used for each file and what is needed in order to make the parser work with the file of your interest.</p>
<p>This is especially important in case of nonstandard / custom configuration files. It may require some previous work to evaluate the available options.</p>
<h3>Beat the beast</h3>
<p>There are also limitations coming from the fact that the library and/or parsers on the second layer provides an abstraction on top of the configuration file. This abstraction transform a configuration file into a more convenient and meaningful model and establishes a relation between the file and the model.</p>
<p>But the problem is that with most parsers (specially with Augeas) this relation is not bijective. That means some irrelevant pieces of the configuration file are not represented in the model. For example some spaces can be left out if they are not needed from a syntactic point of view. That can lead to loss of custom padding. </p>
<p>Another example can be comments. You can often see that, if your file uses e.g. &#8220;#&#8221; as a comment mark, then some parsers can squash lines full of these marks (which some developers use as a kind of delimiter) to just one &#8220;#&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a more concrete example, some Augeas lenses do not store initial comment marks in the model. That&#8217;s specially common in lenses for files where several different comment marks are allowed. However, some lenses return the comments including their mark at the beginning, so extra handling is needed at an upper layer of CFA or at application level.</p>
<p>Last but not least, some parsers use the concept of default values when adding new key with not defined value. This can of course lead to some inconsistencies in configuration file&#8217;s look if not handled by an upper layer.</p>
<h2>Practical example</h2>
<p>As already mentioned, CFA is being used as a replacement for the old fashioned SCR in YaST. So we can really take a look to the result of that replacement in several parts, like the handling of <code>/etc/hosts</code> in yast2-network. Leaving aside a fact that the code is now much better readable, we gathered also some performance numbers.</p>
<p>The test was run using an example <code>/etc/hosts</code> file with 10.000 entries (believe it or not, the experiment is based in a real life use case reported by a user). The test was done using YaST&#8217;s command line interface and measured using the good old <code>time</code> utility. Since the command line interface doesn&#8217;t currently support entering hosts entries, only reading operations were tested.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>time</th>
<th>SCR</th>
<th>CFA</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>real</td>
<td>1m15.735s</td>
<td>0m19.079s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>user</td>
<td>1m15.076s</td>
<td>0m18.348s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sys</td>
<td>0m0.164s</td>
<td>0m0.244s</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, this part of code is now approximately four times faster than before, so the practical results look very promising. Moreover, the CFA&#8217;s code is better designed and much better covered by automated tests.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the YaST team is investing into both sides of the same coin &#8211; CFA development and conversion of YaST&#8217;s code from SCR to CFA.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Here we go again! Only one week after our previous report, we already have a new bunch of (hopefully) exciting news. Let&#8217;s take a look to the outcome of our 34th Scrum sprint.</p>
<h3>Trusted boot support for EFI</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/05/18/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-19/">the report of our 19th sprint</a>, we already presented the new (at that point in time) and shiny Trusted Boot support in YaST2 Bootloader. So far, the only supported scenario was legacy boot (i.e. no UEFI) on x86_64 systems. Now, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/01org/tpm2.0-tools/">TPM2</a>, is also possible use Trusted Boot with EFI, so we added support for it in our beloved bootloader module.</p>
<p>So now YaST Bootloader looks the same in non-EFI and EFI variants, no matter which underlying technology is actually used. Of course, YaST is only the tip of the iceberg, booting in Trusted Boot with EFI is possible thanks to all the tools that has recently added support for TPM2. openSUSE developers and packagers rock!</p>
<h3>Configuring the NTP service in CaaSP</h3>
<p>For a CaaSP cluster to work properly, it&#8217;s vitally important that all nodes have their clocks in sync. So, from now on, the installer is able to configure each node in a proper way and the administration node will act as NTP server for the worker nodes.</p>
<p>To achieve that, the user will be asked to specify one or several NTP servers to be used as time source during administration node installation and YaST will take care of the rest (updating the configuration and enabling the service).</p>
<p>If a NTP service is announced through SLP, YaST will propose automatically.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ntp.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ntp-300x225.png" alt="NTP configuration in YaST" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12469" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ntp-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ntp-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ntp.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>For worker nodes, YaST will configure the system to keep it synchronized with the administration role.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: improvements in the guided setup</h3>
<p>Through the previous reports, you have been able to follow the evolution of the renovated guided setup for the partitioning proposal. This sprint is not different, we have improved and adjusted that new wizard even further, making it smarter and more usable.</p>
<p>The new version is able to decide which steps to show depending on the current scenario. For example, in systems with only one disk the whole disk selection dialog will be skipped. The steps are also simplified by disabling widgets that are not applicable to the current situation. For example, if there is no previous Linux installation, the question about what to do with the existing Linux partitions will be disabled.</p>
<p>And talking about the actions to perform on preexisting partitions, that has also been improved. In the first guided setup version, these options were only displaying for illustrative purposes, but now they are 100% real and the proposal will honor their values, so the user can easily select what to do with previous Windows or Linux partitions. We even added a third option for other kind of partitions.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/new_se.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/new_se-300x225.png" alt="New settings in the storage proposal" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12471" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/new_se-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/new_se-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/new_se.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Last but not least (regarding the guided setup), the password selection for encryption is now more usable, allowing the user to choose a not so strong password if really desired.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bad_password.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bad_password-300x225.png" alt="Allowing users to shoot their own feet" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12472" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bad_password-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bad_password-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bad_password.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Insserv removal</h3>
<p>YaST is a complex and large piece software. It means that time to time some pieces that used to be great and shiny become obsolete and end up being useless. The cycle of life. 😉</p>
<p>Some time ago, it was decided it was time for <code>insserv</code> to enjoy retirement and it was replaced by a stub. But there were still calls to <code>insserv</code> in YaST and we decided to remove them all. There were several reasons for that decision. Basicaly (open)SUSE has used systemd for couple of years already, so revisiting places where the YaST code depended on SySV was a must. As a side effect it shortened the list of YaST dependencies and, in the end, it is another small step towards smaller installation.</p>
<p>So good bye <code>insserv</code>, it was a pleasure to work with you.</p>
<h3>Improvements in the ZFCP Controller Configuration for zKVM on S/390</h3>
<p>When running the installer on a mainframe in a zKVM virtual machine it displays a warning about not detected ZFCP controllers:</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/zFCP.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/zFCP-300x227.png" alt="ZFCP warning on S/390" width="300" height="227" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12473" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/zFCP-300x227.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/zFCP-768x582.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/zFCP.png 1022w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>However, when running in a zKVM virtual machine the disk is accessible via the <em>virtio</em> driver, not through an emulated ZFCP controller. The warning is pointless and confusing.</p>
<p>The fix was basically just an one-liner which skips the warning when the zKVM virtualization is detected, but the YaST module for ZFCP doesn&#8217;t usually receive to much maintenance, so we applied our <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpportunisticRefactoring.html">boy scout rule</a> and improved the code a bit.</p>
<p>The improvements include using Rubocop for clean and unified coding style, enabling code coverage to know how much the code is tested (in this case it turned out to be horribly low, just about 4%), removing unused files, etc&#8230; You can find the details in the <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-s390/pull/44">pull request</a>.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: improvements all around</h3>
<p>As we reported in <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2017/03/07/yast-development-during-hack-week-15/">our report about Hack Week 15</a>, we have been working on <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/projects/yast2-storage-ng-as-a-libstorage-ng-wrapper-poc">an alternative way</a> to offer the power of the new storage library to the Ruby world. The new API is finally ready for prime-time and used in all the Ruby code.</p>
<p>We took the opportunity to greatly improve the developer documentation and to revamp the yast2-storage-ng <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng/blob/master/README.md">README</a> and status page.</p>
<p>We also did some extra checks and added automated testing to ensure our partitioning proposal ensure the requisites if a S/390 system using ZFCP, so mainframe users also have a peaceful transition to the new storage stack.</p>
<p>We also greatly improved the ability of the new library to work with alternative name schemes for the devices. Up to now, only using plain kernel device name (e.g. <code>/dev/sda1</code>) was fully supported. Now we can do all the operations (specially generating the <code>/etc/fstab</code> file) by device name, by UUID, by filesystem label, by device id and by device path.</p>
<h3>More content already in the oven!</h3>
<p>As you already know, at least we repeat it quite often, 😉 YaST was converted from YCP to Ruby some time ago. However, this conversion was done on language basis. Some old design decisions and principles stayed, like the usage of <a href="https://yastgithubio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/#system-configuration-repository-scr">SCR</a> for accessing the underlying system.</p>
<p>Some time ago we introduced <a href="https://github.com/config-files-api/config_files_api">CFA (Config Files Api Gem)</a> as a more powerful and flexible Ruby-powered replacement for SCR. Although we have been using it for a while in several YaST modules, we felt the concepts and rationales behind its operation where not that clear.</p>
<p>So we have invested some time improving the documentation and writing a blog post to properly present and explain CFA to the world. We will publish it next week, so stay tuned!</p>
<h3>Great news ahead!</h3>
<p>The next sprint will be the first in which the whole YaST team will work together integrating the new storage stack in every single part of YaST. So we hope the next report to be full of good news about the expert partitioner, improvements in AutoYaST&#8217;s handling of disks and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, that would be only a small fraction of all the stuff we plan to work on. See you in three weeks with more news!</p>

            <p>It has been a long time since our last status update! The reason is the end of the previous sprint caught quite some of the YaST Team members on vacations and, when the vacation period was over, we were so anxious to jump into development to make YaST another little bit better that the blog post somehow fell behind.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s time to pay our (reporting) debts. So these are some of the highlights of the 33th development sprint that finished on April 11th.</p>
<h3>AutoYaST and Salt integration</h3>
<p>During this sprint, a new module has been added to the YaST tool box: <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-configuration-management/pull/1">YaST2 Configuration Management</a>.</p>
<p>This module offers integration between AutoYaST and configuration management systems like <a href="https://saltstack.com/salt-open-source/">Salt</a>. The idea is that AutoYaST will take care of system installation (partitioning, network setup, etc.) and, if desired, the system configuration can be delegated to one of those external tools.</p>
<p>The YaST Configuration Management module was born during an internal SUSE workshop during the last summer and it got more love during HackWeek <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/15/projects/integrate-autoyast-with-software-configuration-management-systems">14</a> and <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/15/projects/yast-module-for-suse-manager-salt-parametrizable-formulas">15</a>.</p>
<p>Now it is officially part of the YaST family and it will be included in the upcoming releases.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yast-cm.jpeg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yast-cm-300x190.jpeg" alt="The new module: YaST - Configuration Manager" width="300" height="190" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12425" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yast-cm-300x190.jpeg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yast-cm-768x486.jpeg 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yast-cm-1024x648.jpeg 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/yast-cm.jpeg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Extend the YaST Installer Workflow by Add-ons</h3>
<p>The YaST installer already allows extending the installation work flow by add-on extensions. However, this was only supported for the SUSE tag repositories used on the ISO installation media. That means the online repositories, which normally use the RPM-MD data format, could not use this feature.</p>
<p>This sprint we extended the support also for the other repository formats (basically any repository format supported by libzypp). The original limitation was caused by the fact that the other repository types do not support other files except the RPM packages.</p>
<p>To overcome this limitation we now support packaging the installer extension files into a standard RPM package which can be then provided by any repository type.</p>
<p>The implementation is <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-installation/blob/master/doc/installer_extension.md">documented</a> and there is the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/YaST:extension">YaST:extension</a> OBS project with a simple example extension.</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/extended-workflow.gif" alt="The example extension in action" /></p>
<h3>YaST pattern definitions</h3>
<p>The software pattern definitions have been split and moved to the respective OBS devel projects. See more details in <a href="https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2017-01/msg00041.html">this opensuse-factory announcement</a>. That means the YaST patterns are now maintained in the<br />
<a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/YaST:Head/patterns-yast">YaST:Head</a> project.</p>
<p>The project sources have been imported to the <a href="https://github.com/yast/patterns-yast">GitHub</a> repository to track the history and use the code review workflow. Also and the usual <a href="https://ci.opensuse.org/view/Yast/job/patterns-yast-master/">Jenkins</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/yast/patterns-yast">Travis</a> automation has been set up. For contributing your changes in the YaST patterns use the usual GitHub pull request workflow as for the other YaST packages. Thank you in advance! 😉</p>
<h3>CaaSP deserves its own YaST package!</h3>
<p>Among other things, our team is working hard to make YaST fulfill the requirements of the upcoming Containers as a Service Platform (CaaSP) product. As part of this effort, we have added some new features, discovered (and fixed) some bugs, improved documentation and so on.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also added some specific CaaSP code, so during this sprint we&#8217;ve decided to create a new dedicated package (<a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-caasp">yast2-caasp</a>) and move the code there.</p>
<p>Currently it only contains <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-installation/blob/master/doc/system-role-handlers.md">system role handlers</a> and some <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-caasp/blob/master/doc">additional documentation</a>, but most probably we will add some stuff during the upcoming months.</p>
<h3>Bootloader improvement</h3>
<p>Also the bootloader module has been improved to better handle invalid partitioning proposal in the CaaSP product. When the partitioning proposal did not contain a valid root directory then the bootloader module crashed.</p>
<p>After the fix it now displays details about the problem so the user can manually fix the configuration.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bootloader.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bootloader-300x220.png" alt="New YaST-bootloader warning" width="300" height="220" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12420" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bootloader-300x220.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bootloader-768x564.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bootloader.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Automatic screenshots in the AutoYaST integration tests</h3>
<p>An important part of keeping the quality in a job is investing in the quality of the tools. So during this sprint we decided to improve the capabilities of the <a href="https://github.com/yast/autoyast-integration-test">AutoYaST integration tests</a>. To help with debugging, AYTests will now store a screenshot and, if possible, YaST2 logs from installation/upgrade under the workspace.</p>
<p>The screenshot will be refreshed every 30 seconds so, if a timeout occurs, it will be now easy to find out where the process got stuck.</p>
<h3>Creating your own installation media</h3>
<p>Recently, a new set of packages were introduced into Tumbleweed to help setting up the local installation servers. They are named <code>tftpboot-installation-&lt;PRODUCT&gt;-&lt;ARCH&gt;</code> (for example <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/tftpboot-installation-openSUSE-Tumbleweed-x86_64">tftpboot-installation-openSUSE-Tumbleweed-x86_64</a>) and are intended to make it easy to set up the PXE boot environment for an installation server.</p>
<p>These packages basically contain the installation environment as found on the SUSE installation media.</p>
<p>And this enables <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/mkdud">mksusecd</a> to create a network installation image from it.</p>
<p>For example, the package above installs its files into directory <code>/srv/tftpboot/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-x86_64</code>.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s run</p>
<pre><code>mksusecd \
  --create foo.iso \
  --net=http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/suse \
  /srv/tftpboot/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-x86_64
</code></pre>
<p>and we get a network installation ISO image that will install the Tumbleweed distribution using the official openSUSE Tumbleweed repository.</p>
<p>Note that we are using the RPM-MD repository at <code>/tumbleweed/repo/oss/suse</code> instead of <code>/tumbleweed/repo/oss</code> as one might expect. Of course it is also OK to use the <code>/tumbleweed/repo/oss</code> repository but we want to be cool. 😀</p>
<p>You can put <code>foo.iso</code> also on a USB stick</p>
<pre><code>dd if=foo.iso of=/dev/&lt;USB_DEVICE&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and boot from it.</p>
<p>To be extra-cool, try the <code>--fat</code> option</p>
<pre><code>mksusecd \
  --create foo.iso \
  --fat \
  --net=http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss/suse \
  /srv/tftpboot/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-x86_64
</code></pre>
<p>that will create a FAT partition for the data, which is a bit more convenient when you plan to put the image on an USB stick (and yes, you can still use the image to burn a DVD).</p>
<h3>Serial console at boot</h3>
<p>The YaST bootloader module can be used to configure the parameters to allow accessing the system&#8217;s boot process through a serial console. But that&#8217;s a relatively complex topic and is easy to make mistakes when specifying such parameters. In the past, the message displayed by YaST in case of error was not helpful enough. To improve usability, the new pop-up is nicer and includes a proper example, as can be seen in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bootloader-srial.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bootloader-srial-300x188.png" alt="More guided serial console setup in YaST-Bootloader" width="300" height="188" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12421" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bootloader-srial-300x188.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bootloader-srial-768x481.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bootloader-srial-1024x642.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bootloader-srial.png 1348w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: new proposal guided setup</h3>
<p>The previous sprint we brought in the ability to use encryption for both partition-based and LVM-based proposals. This time we go a step further and present a new guided setup that allows you to do even more. We have worked hand in hand with our UX experts to design a new proposal wizard composed by four steps.</p>
<p>In the first one, a list with the available disks is showed and you can select which ones to use for your fresh installation.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided1.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided1-300x225.png" alt="Guided proposal setup - step 1" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12426" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided1-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided1-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided1.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>In the second screen, you can select a specific disk to be used for the root partition, and also, you might decide what to do with the existing Windows and Linux installed systems. Currently, this last functionality is only illustrative, but it will become functional in the upcoming sprints.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided2.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided2-300x225.png" alt="Guided proposal setup - step 2" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12427" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided2-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided2-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided2.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The third step is surely more familiar for you. As in the previous sprint, here you can select the LVM usage and encryption. And of course, the encryption password will be checked to ensure you use it is strong enough.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided3.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided3-300x225.png" alt="Guided proposal setup - step 3" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12428" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided3-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided3-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided3.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, in the last step the filesystem type for the root partition can be selected. Moreover, you can decide whether to use a separate home or not. Or you can select another filesystem type for your home.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided4.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided4-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12429" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided4-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided4-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guided4.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>As result of the wizard, a new partition schema is automatically created taking into account all the options you have selected. And naturally, that is only the first version. We will let know about the news in the guided setup in following sprints.</p>
<h3>Warn the user in case of inconsistencies in Online Migration</h3>
<p>Before the live Service Pack migration the system can be manually modified in many ways producing inconsistencies between the installed system and the extensions/modules registered in the registration server.</p>
<p>In this sprint we have added some steps that will allow the user to fix the inconsistencies. Also the displayed summary of the available migrations has been improved showing information about products without any migration available (e.g. third party addons).</p>
<p>For the online migration it is important to be able to rollback to the original state (before the migration started) when a problem occurs or the migration is aborted by user.</p>
<p>Now the user will be able to decide if the registered but not installed products should be deactivated as part of the rollback.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/addons-warning.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/addons-warning-300x171.png" alt="Warning for inconsistent online migration" width="300" height="171" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12430" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/addons-warning-300x171.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/addons-warning.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>See you very soon!</h3>
<p>As usual, this report only covers a relatively small part of all the work done during the previous sprint and, as usual, you will have to wait until the end of the current sprint to get more exciting news. The bright side is that the sprint will finish in a matter of days, so you will only need to wait one week to read our next report.</p>
<p>Stay tuned and have a lot of fun!</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>To make sure you didn&#8217;t missed us too much, in <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2017/03/07/yast-development-during-hack-week-15/">our latest blog post</a> we summarized all the YaST-related projects worked during Hack Week 15. But after all the fun, it was time for&#8230; more fun! So let&#8217;s take a look to what the team has delivered on this first sprint after Hack Week 15.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: encrypted proposal without LVM</h3>
<p>One of the known limitations of the current installer is that it&#8217;s only able to automatically propose an encrypted schema if LVM is used. For historical reasons, if you want to encrypt your root and/or home partitions but not to use LVM, you would need to use the expert partitioner&#8230; and hope for the best from the bootloader proposal.</p>
<p>But the new storage stack is here (well, almost here) to make all the old limitations vanish. With <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/storage-ng/images/iso/">our testing ISO</a> it&#8217;s already possible to set encryption with just one click for both partition-based and LVM-based proposals. The best possible partition schema is correctly created and everything is encrypted as the user would expect. We even have continuous tests in our internal openQA instance for it.</p>
<p>The part of the installer managing the bootloader installation is still not adapted, which means the resulting system would need some manual fixing of Grub before being able to boot&#8230; but that&#8217;s something for an upcoming sprint (likely the very next one).</p>
<h3>Improved add-ons listing for SLE12-SP1</h3>
<p>The dialog in SLES-12-SP1 for selecting the add-ons after registering the system was originally designed just for a small list of add-ons. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), the number of add-ons grew over the time and it exceeded the original limit for the text mode UI.</p>
<p>The equivalent screen in SLE-12-SP2 is not affected by the problem because it uses a different layout with scrollable list. But the SP1 dialog looks like this.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scc-sp1-bad.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scc-sp1-bad-300x188.png" alt="Broken add-ons list in SP1" width="300" height="188" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12366" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scc-sp1-bad-300x188.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scc-sp1-bad-768x481.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scc-sp1-bad.png 802w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>If you look carefully at the screenshot you will see that the <i>Web and Scripting Module</i> is missing in the list and the <code>Back</code>, <code>Next</code> and <code>Abort</code> buttons at the bottom are also not displayed.</p>
<p>The fix decreased the size of the <code>Details</code> widget and allowed displaying more items in each column. Now there is even free space for three more add-ons.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-sp1-good.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-sp1-good-300x188.png" alt="Fixed addons list in SP1" width="300" height="188" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12367" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-sp1-good-300x188.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-sp1-good-768x481.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-sp1-good.png 802w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Moreover the dialog is now dynamic and checks the current size of the screen. If there is enough free space then the list is displayed in one column so the labels are not truncated and the <code>Details</code> widget size is increased back to the original size.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-sp1-big.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-sp1-big-300x234.png" alt="Add-ons list in SP1 with enough space" width="300" height="234" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12368" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-sp1-big-300x234.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-sp1-big-768x600.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-sp1-big-1024x800.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-sp1-big.png 1052w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: Btrfs subvolumes</h3>
<p>The management of subvolumes is one of those features that make Btrfs rather unique and that need special handling when compared to more traditional file systems. That was indeed one of the several reasons to rewrite <code>libstorage</code> &#8211; Btrfs subvolumes never fully fitted the philosophy and data structures on the old (current) <code>libstorage</code> and <code>yast2-storage</code>.</p>
<p>In this sprint we introduced support for subvolumes in <code>libstorage-ng</code> from the ground up, taking into consideration all the specificities, use cases and scenarios found in the past. And, hopefully, in a way that is also prepared for whatever the future brings.</p>
<p>The new functionality is already working and tested and it&#8217;s included in the latest versions of <code>libstorage-ng</code>, but is still not used in the proposal or any other part <code>yast2-storage</code>. You will have to wait another sprint to see more visible results. At least if &#8220;more visible&#8221; means screenshots. Meanwhile, if you like images you can always enjoy the graphs generated from the internal structures managed by <code>libstorage-ng</code>.</p>

<h3>Storage reimplementation: system upgrade</h3>
<p>The new storage stack has been able to install an openSUSE system for quite some time already. While we keep improving that area, the next challenge was to make the upgrade from a previous openSUSE version also possible using <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/storage-ng/images/iso/">our testing ISO</a>.</p>
<p>That implies scanning the hard disks looking for previous installations, allowing the user to select one, mounting the corresponding partitions or LVM volumes, performing the update of every package and doing some final tasks like updating the bootloader configuration.</p>
<p>Following the iterative approach encouraged by Scrum, we focused in the first three steps, which is something that a user (or openQA, for that matter) can test and verify. So now we are able to detect and list pre-existing systems and start the upgrade process on the selected one. And we have automated tests in openQA to ensure it works across all the combinations of partition-based vs LVM-based layout and UUID-based vs name-based <code>fstab</code> file.</p>
<h3>Add-ons can define new system roles</h3>
<p>YaST is pretty customizable when it comes to adapt/modify the installation workflow. Among other things, add-ons are allowed to adapt the workflow (adding/removing steps), define new proposals, etc. And starting now, they can also define new system roles.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see an example of adding a new mail server role:</p>
<pre>
&lt;update&gt;
  &lt;system_roles&gt;
    &lt;insert_system_roles config:type="list"&gt;
      &lt;insert_system_role&gt;
        &lt;system_roles config:type="list"&gt;
          &lt;system_role&gt;
            &lt;id&gt;mail_role&lt;/id&gt;
            &lt;software&gt;
              &lt;default_patterns&gt;base Minimal mail_server&lt;/default_patterns&gt;
            &lt;/software&gt;
          &lt;/system_role&gt;
        &lt;/system_roles&gt;
      &lt;/insert_system_role&gt;
    &lt;/insert_system_roles&gt;
  &lt;/system_roles&gt;
&lt;/update&gt;

&lt;!-- Don't forget to add the texts --&gt;
&lt;texts&gt;
  &lt;mail_role&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;Mail Server&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;/mail_role&gt;
  &lt;mail_role_description&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;• Software needed to set up a mail server
• No production ready yet!&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;/mail_role_description&gt;
&lt;/texts&gt;
</pre>
<p>And now let&#8217;s see how it looks:</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-adding-roles.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-adding-roles-300x225.png" alt="A role added by an addon" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12373" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-adding-roles-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-adding-roles-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/addons-adding-roles.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Which leads us to the next section&#8230;</p>
<h3>The list of roles becomes responsive in text mode</h3>
<p>A really nice thing about YaST is that it&#8217;s able to run in textmode, so you don&#8217;t need a graphical interface to install or configure your system. As a consequence, YaST developers need to keep certain limitations in mind when working in the user interface.</p>
<p>Now that add-ons can add new system roles, we noticed a potential problem in the dialog selection screen: we eventually will get out of space if more than one system role is added. So we decided to improve how system roles are displayed to make them fit in a 80&#215;25 mode (that is, only 25 lines of text). Let&#8217;s see the changes with some examples.</p>
<p>This is how the screen looks by default, with a reasonably small set of roles.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/roles-fit.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/roles-fit-300x167.png" alt="Default system roles list" width="300" height="167" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12387" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/roles-fit-300x167.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/roles-fit.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>If the system detects there is no space to present all the information in such a convenient way, it removes all the spaces so at least the information is all there, even if it looks a little bit packed.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/roles-packed.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/roles-packed-300x167.png" alt="Roles list with no extra space" width="300" height="167" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12388" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/roles-packed-300x167.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/roles-packed.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>If even that is not enough, the extra descriptions are omitted, which gives us way more room.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/roles-dontfit.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/roles-dontfit-300x167.png" alt="Compact roles list" width="300" height="167" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12389" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/roles-dontfit-300x167.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/roles-dontfit.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>If roles don&#8217;t fit even without the descriptions, the introductory text will be also omitted which means we can present up to eighteen (yes, 18!) roles in the screen.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: guided setup mock-up</h3>
<p>As explained in several previous reports, we are collaborating closely with SUSE UX experts to design the revamped interfaces of the installer&#8217;s partitioning proposal and the expert partitioner. We already showed you the document we used as a base to discuss the partitioning proposal, including the conclusions, and the first very simple prototype of the so-called Guided Setup.</p>
<p>During this sprint, that collaborative effort focused on defining exactly how every step of that wizard should work and look like. The goal was to get some interface mock-ups to be used as starting point for the upcoming sprint. More than ever, a picture (well, four of them) is worth a thousand words.</p>

<h3>Prevent the installation of CaaSP if Btrfs snapshots are not possible</h3>
<p>CaaSP is a single purpose system, and having snapshots enabled is essential. So there&#8217;s now a check in place that will simply prevent you from going on with the installation if snapshots are disabled (for example, if the disk is too small).</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/snapshots-blocker.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/snapshots-blocker-300x225.png" alt="Blocked CaaSP installation" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12396" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/snapshots-blocker-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/snapshots-blocker-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/snapshots-blocker.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: better handling of /etc/fstab and /etc/cryptab</h3>
<p>For the new storage stack, we refactored the classes to handle <code>/etc/fstab</code>. While this would normally not be anything to write much about, we included intelligent handling for existing comments based on <a href="https://github.com/shundhammer/commented-config-file">this standalone GitHub project</a>.</p>
<p>This means that existing comment blocks at the start and at the end of the file remain untouched, and comments before any content entry remain attached to that entry; i.e. when that entry is moved around in the file (e.g. because of mount dependencies), that comment is moving along with the entry it belongs to. While this is not 100% fool proof, it is much better than the usual strategy to simply discard such comments when the file is rewritten. </p>
<h3>Quite some adaptations and bugfixes for CaaSP</h3>
<p>As you already know from previous reports and other sources, a considerable part of SUSE&#8217;s development firepower is focused on building the upcoming CaaSP. As part of that heavy development process, the YaST team invested a significant part of the sprint adapting YaST for CaaSP and fixing bugs introduced by previous adaptations. A large collection of changes here and there that are hard to summarize here but that help CaaSP to be a couple of steps closer to the final goal.</p>
<h3>Keep it rolling!</h3>
<p>We have already planned our next sprint which will hopefully bring more features to the new storage stack, CaaSP-related improvements, a surprise about AutoYaST and more stuff. And, of course, it will be followed by its corresponding report.</p>
<p>So see you in three weeks. Stay tuned and have a lot of fun!</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>As we announced in <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12263">the previous report</a>, our 31th Scrum sprint was slightly shorter than the usual ones. But you would never say so looking to this blog post. We have a lot of things to talk you about!</p>
<h3>Teaching the installer self-update to be a better citizen</h3>
<p>As you may know, YaST includes a <a href="https://fate.suse.com/319716">nice feature</a> which allows the installer to update itself in order to solve bugs in the installation media. This mechanism has been included in SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SP2, although it&#8217;s not enabled by default (you need to pass an extra option <code>selfupdate=1</code> to make it work).</p>
<p>So after getting some feedback, we&#8217;re working toward fixing some usability problems. The first of them is that, in some situations, the self-update mechanism is too intrusive.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario: you&#8217;re installing a system behind a firewall which prevents the machine to connect to the outside network. As the SUSE Customer Center will be unreachable, YaST complains about not being able to get the list of repositories for the self-update. And, after that, you get another complain because the fallback repository is not accessible. Two error messages and 2 timeouts.</p>
<p>And the situation could be even worse if you don&#8217;t have access to a DNS server (add another error message).</p>
<p>So after some discussion we&#8217;ve decided to show such errors only if the user has specified SMT or a custom self-update repository (which is also possible). In any other case, the error is logged and the self-update is skipped completely.</p>
<p>You can find further information in our <a href="https://gist.github.com/imobachgs/cb03b6a87dd5e31c89a9463d30db4252">Self-Update Use Cases and Error Handling document</a>.</p>
<p>During upcoming sprints, we&#8217;ll keep working on making the self-update feature great!</p>
<h3>Configuring workers during CaaSP installation</h3>
<p>While CaaSP release approaches, our team is still working hard to satisfy the new requirements. Thankfully, YaST is a pretty flexible tool and it allows us to change a lot of things.</p>
<p>For CaaSP installation, YaST features a one-dialog installation screen. During this sprint, configuration of the <code>Worker</code> role has been implemented, including validation of the entered URL and writing the value to the installed system. You can check the animated screenshot for details.</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/worker.gif" alt="The CaaSP worker configuration" /></p>
<h3>New desktop selection screen in openSUSE installer</h3>
<p>The world of Linux desktop environments change relatively quick, with new options popping-up and some projects being abandoned. Thanks to the openSUSE&#8217;s community of packagers we have a lot of these new desktop environments available on the openSUSE distributions. But the status of those packages for openSUSE is also subject to changes: some desktop environments are poorly maintained while others have a strong and active group of packagers and maintainer behind.</p>
<p>The YaST Team does not have enough overview and time to watch all these desktop environment and evaluate which one is ready or not for being in the installer&#8217;s desktop selection screen. So the openSUSE Release Team decided to replace this dialog with something a bit more generic but still useful for newcomers.</p>
<p>They asked the YaST Team to come up with a new dialog featuring the two openSUSE main desktops (KDE Plasma and GNOME) and allowing the easy selection of other environments without reworking the dialog in the future. The goal of that new dialog was to replace the existing one you can see in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop-300x226.png" alt="The old desktop selection screen" width="300" height="226" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12312" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop-300x226.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop-768x579.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop.png 1023w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>We decided the new dialog should rely on patterns for several reasons. The main one is that the set of patterns is under the close control of the openSUSE community, which looks more closely than us to the desktop environments and their integration into the distribution. Moreover, each pattern specifies its own icon and description that can be somehow re-used by the installer.</p>
<p>We also took the opportunity to merge this almost empty and outdated dialog with the new one.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos-300x226.png" alt="The old additional repositories screen" width="300" height="226" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12313" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos-300x226.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos-768x578.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos-1024x770.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos.png 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Addons are no longer produced for openSUSE, so only the second checkbox made any sense nowadays. Moreover, the functionality of that second checkbox directly influence the available selection of patterns, so it made more sense to merge everything in a single screen that keeping an extra step in the installation just to accommodate a checkbox.</p>
<p>So we sent a proposal for the new dialog to the opensuse-factory mailing list and, after implementing many of the ideas discussed there (like better wording or using a button instead of a checkbox for the online repositories), this is the new dialog that replaces the two ones mentioned above.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop-300x225.png" alt="The new desktop selection dialog" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12315" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop-768x577.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Selecting &#8220;custom&#8221; will take the users to the already existing patterns selection screen. Just in case you don&#8217;t remember how that screen looks like, you can check this image.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns-300x225.png" alt="The patterns selection screen" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12316" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns-1024x768.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns.png 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>If these screenshots are not enough to make your mind about the change, you can check the following animation, in which KDE Plasma is initially chosen to be changed at a later point (going back in the workflow) to LXQt.</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/desktop_animation.gif" alt="Desktop selection animation" /></p>
<p>It will take some time before the changes hit the Tumbleweed installer, since they obviously have a non-trivial impact on the openQA tests, that will need some adaptation.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everybody that contributed to this new feature by providing feedback and suggestions through the mailing list. Once again, the openSUSE community has proved to be simply awesome!</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: improved handling of logical partitions</h3>
<p>Our reimplementation of the storage layer keeps getting improvements here and there. With the base x86 case working, we are now implementing the tricky parts, like the partitions renumbering that takes place when dealing with logical partitions in a MBR style partition table.</p>
<p>With GPT partition tables or with primary partitions in a MBR partition table, the partition gets a number (like sda1) when it&#8217;s created and keeps that number for its whole lifetime. But logical partition gets constantly renumbered when other partitions are created and destroyed. We need to know in advance what device name every partition will get in order to configure everything beforehand and only commit the changes to the disk when the user clicks in the &#8220;install&#8221; (during the installation process) or &#8220;commit&#8221; (if running the expert partitioner).</p>
<p>Now, libstorage-ng is able to simulate in memory the re-numbering process, so we can calculate all the settings related to partitioning (like the configuration of the bootloader) before really touching the disk.</p>
<h3>Making kdump work in CaaSP</h3>
<p>When you enable the Kernel Crash Dump (kdump), you probably expect that you will get a kind of core dump, like you do for regular processes. What you might not expect is an automatic reboot. That is a nice bonus. If you are tired of waiting for an <em>actual</em> kernel crash, you can test your kdump setup by triggering a crash yourself. Just run this as root:</p>
<pre>
echo c &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger</code>
</pre>
<p>The way kdump works is by allocating some extra memory at boot time and putting a second kernel+initrd there. When the main kernel realizes it is crashing, it transfers control (by kexec) to the other one, which has only one purpose, to dump the memory of the crashed kernel.</p>
<p>In the upcoming Containers as a Service Platform, kdump was not working because the root filesystem is read-only there and we were not able to create the kdump initrd. We <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-kdump/pull/73">fixed it</a> by creating it just after the RPMs are installed, when the FS is still read-write.</p>
<h3>Fixes for Snapper in CaaSP</h3>
<p>Kdump was not the only component affected by the fact of having a read-only filesystem in CaaSP. Snapper was also running into problems when trying to execute the <code>rollback</code> and <code>cleanup</code> operations. Now the problems are fixed. While working on that we did enough interesting findings to deserve a separate blog entry. So you can expect a new entry in the <a href="http://snapper.io/news.html">Snapper.io blog</a> soon.</p>
<h3>Snapshot-related improvements in the expert partitioner</h3>
<p>While we work on the new storage system, we are still taking care and improving the current one that will continue to be shipped with SLE12-SP3, SUSE CaaSP and openSUSE Leap 42.3. During this sprint we introduced a couple of usability improvements in the expert partitioner related to Btrfs subvolumes.</p>
<p>First of all, we moved the &#8220;Enable Snapshots&#8221; checkbox that was pretty much hidden in the &#8220;Subvolume Handling&#8221; dialog to the place where it really belongs &#8211; below the selector of the file-system type.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-300x187.png" alt="New location for enabling snapshots" width="300" height="187" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12327" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-300x187.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-768x478.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-1024x637.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots.png 1350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>In addition, we added the warning you can see in the screenshot below for users enabling snapshots in a potentially problematic setup.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning-300x186.png" alt="Warning for snapshots in a small partition" width="300" height="186" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12328" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning-300x186.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning-768x477.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning-1024x635.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning.png 1352w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Bring back the beta warning on CaaSP</h3>
<p>And talking about warnings, we improved the CaaSP installation dialog to show the Alpha/Beta product warning at the beginning. After changing the CaaSP installation to use the all-in-one dialog <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12263">described in our previous post</a>, this feature was lost as it is part of the initial EULA dialog. Now it is back and the users should now properly see the current product status.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning-300x225.png" alt="The CaaSP alpha/beta warning pop-up" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12305" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: encrypted LVM proposal</h3>
<p>Back to our storage layer reimplementation, the new system is now able to propose a setup with encrypted LVM. Since some sprints ago, we were already able to propose a partition-based and a LVM setup. That means the new proposal is now feature-pair with the old one, with the only exceptions of Btrfs sub-volumes (that shouldn&#8217;t be a big challenge) and s/390 storage (that is still not properly managed by the underlying libstorage-ng).</p>
<p>The bright part is that the new code is written with re-usability in mind, which means implementing an encrypted partition-based proposal (with no LVM) would be trivial. The new code is 100% covered by automatic unit tests and scores to the top in all the automatic quality checkers we have run (like Rubycritics, CodeClimate, and Rubocop).</p>
<p>So now we are prepared for whatever the future brings, having lost no single feature in the way.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: prototype if the UI for the proposal settings</h3>
<p>The next challenge is to make the power of that new storage proposal available to the users through the user interface. In the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12263">previous post</a> we presented the document describing the general ideas we wanted to discuss with UX experts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s our pleasure to announce we met the experts and we very easily reached an agreement on how the user interaction should be. During this sprint we already implemented a prototype of the future proposal settings wizard that is, as usual, included in our <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/storage-ng/images/iso/">testing ISO</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we have solid foundations, it&#8217;s very likely that the following sprint will result in the fully working wizard, with almost-final wording and design.</p>
<h3>Support for CaaSP added to the AutoYaST integration tests</h3>
<p>While fixing a problem with AutoYaST and CaaSP, we decided to extend our AutoYaST integration testing tool to support CaaSP. But, as a side effect, we also made some additional improvements that were long overdue (like improving the procedure to download ISOs, reducing timeouts, etc.).</p>
<p>Now, our internal Jenkins instance takes care of running AutoYaST integration tests for the development version of CaaSP (as it already does for SLE 12 SP2).</p>
<h3>Services manager moved to first auto-installation stage</h3>
<p>AutoYaST allows to <a href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/singlehtml/book_autoyast/book_autoyast.html#CreateProfile.Services">define a set of services</a> to be enabled/disabled in the installed system, applying this configuration during the 2nd stage (after the first reboot).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this approach won&#8217;t work for CaaSP because, in that case, the 2nd stage won&#8217;t be available. For that reason, during this sprint, we have adapted AutoYaST to write services configuration during 1st stage.</p>
<p>As usual, not only CaaSP, but other future (open)SUSE versions will benefit of this change.</p>
<h3>Faster YaST installation when the release notes cannot be downloaded</h3>
<p>Sometimes a very small simple change in a program makes a very noticeable impact in its everyday use. That&#8217;s the case of a fix implemented during this sprint. YaST usually re-tries to download the distribution release notes several times if the first attempt was unsuccessful. Although that&#8217;s correct from a general point of view, there are cases in which retrying makes no sense and only delays the installation. We have now added failed DNS resolution to that list of cases, which should result in a noticeable faster installation in many scenarios.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the case of AutoYaST we now skip downloading the release notes completely. Downloading them don&#8217;t make us much sense in the kind of unattended scenarios handled by AutoYaST and skipping this step and all the possible associated problems result in a more robust process.</p>
<h3>Better continuous integration for Libyui</h3>
<p>In the previous sprint we switched to Docker at Travis so we could build and test our packages in the native openSUSE system instead of the default Ubuntu. This sprint we did the same change also for the Libyui library which implements the UI part of YaST.</p>
<p>Originally we could not build the Libyui packages at Travis as either the required build dependencies were missing or were present at a very old unusable version. With this switch we can easily use the latest packages from openSUSE Tumbleweed and thus enable Travis builds for all Libyui packages.</p>
<h3>See you after Hack Week!</h3>
<p>As already mentioned, this week is <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/">Hack Week 15</a>! So our Scrum process will be on hold for some days. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the YaST development will stall. Since there are quite some YaST-related projects in the Hack Week page, you can expect YaST to simply go in unexpected directions. 🙂</p>
<p>And remember Hack Week is not a SUSE internal initiative, we are open to collaboration from anybody within or outside the company. So jump in and have fun with us!</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>This is our first post in 2017 and looks like we must start apologizing. In our <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/12/22/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-29/">previous post</a> we promised news about this blog, but the administrative part slowed us down and the surprise is still not ready. On the bright side, we have quite some news about YaST. So let&#8217;s go for it!</p>
<h3>One-click system installation for CaaSP</h3>
<p>As you may know, SUSE has been working on making containers easier, with SUSE Container as a Service Platform. We have referred to it in several previous posts using the CASP acronym, although nowadays the correct one is CaaSP (maybe we could sell the new &#8220;a&#8221; as a shiny feature 😉 ).</p>
<p>Part of this upcoming product is also an interactive installation option using the good old YaST. CaaSP uses a limited subset of the SLE possibilities and we wanted to make the installation simpler to reflect that. So we reduced the number of dialogs you have to click through&#8230; to one!</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/one-click-installation.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/one-click-installation-300x234.png" alt="One-click installation in CaaSP" width="300" height="234" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12266" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/one-click-installation-300x234.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/one-click-installation-768x599.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/one-click-installation.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, it is at the expense of stuffing the screen with more widgets than usual. Still, the only part where you must make a decision is the root password.</p>
<p>We expect that most of the CaaSP installations will actually not use this, because they will be done automatically with AutoYaST. But still this should be useful when you are only getting started.</p>
<h3>Refining the read-only installation proposals</h3>
<p>It was possible to make a proposal &#8220;read-only&#8221; <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/11/10/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-27/">for some time already</a>. However, its black-and-white logic was not sufficient for some use cases. So, it was redesigned and you can mark a proposal hard read-only or soft read-only. The difference is that users will never be able to change hard read-only proposal. However their will be able to modify a soft read-only proposal if the proposal reports an error. It can be useful e.g. for error recovery in software proposal. It has been implemented originally for CaaSP, but it will be available for SLE-12-SP3 and Leap 42.3 too.</p>
<h3>Installing directly from a repomd repository</h3>
<p>When you install (open)SUSE you have up to now needed a specially prepared install repository. In addition to the repository with the RPM packages, it needed a bunch of specially prepared files containing the installation system and our beloved YaST installer.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all gone now!</p>
<p>You can now point the installer to any plain repomd repository. For this to work you have to point the installer to the repomd repository <b>and</b> to the installation system (they can be completely separate now).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
install=http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/repo/oss instsys=disk:/boot/x86_64/root
</pre>
<p>In that example, we install Tumbleweed from the openSUSE website and use the installer from some local media (maybe the NET iso).</p>
<p>To make things even easier there is now a regular package (<code>tftpboot-installation-openSUSE</code>) that contains the installation system and some sample config files.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/linuxrc/blob/master/linuxrc_repo.md">this linuxrc documentation</a> for technical details.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: removing stones from the installation path</h3>
<p>In our <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/12/22/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-29/">latest post</a>, we presented the dedicated openQA instance contantly testing the new storage layer implementation. It still doesn&#8217;t run exactly the same tests than <a href="https://openqa.opensuse.org">openQA.opensuse.org</a> because not all technologies and operations are supported yet in the new yast2-storage. But now we are a couple of steps closer to run the full-blown tests also in our dedicated instance.</p>
<p>During this sprint, the partitioning proposal gained the ability to deal with disks not containing a partition table in advance (it always proposes to create a GPT one in that scenario) and the software selection proposal learned how to use the new storage API, so it can properly inspect the system and the associated error pop-ups are gone from the installation workflow.</p>
<h3>More power to the system roles</h3>
<p>We keep extending the capabilities of the system roles, now with the ability to specify some systemd services to enable. As the roles can define which software gets installed in the system, it made sense for them to also be able to specify the desired status for the services included in that software</p>
<p>For example, it would be possible for a given product (let&#8217;s say a customized openSUSE) to define a &#8220;static web server&#8221; role. Choosing that role during installation would result in a system with a HTTP server already installed and enabled, so the user just need to copy the files to be served into the right directory.</p>
<h3>Expert partitioner is now less restrictive with encryption</h3>
<p>Setting up an encrypted LVM was always pretty easy when using the automated storage proposal &#8211; simply select &#8220;encrypted LVM&#8221; at the proposal settings and you are done.</p>
<p>But doing that manually was almost impossible: The expert partitioner wouldn&#8217;t allow any of the system mount points (&#8220;/&#8221;, &#8220;/usr&#8221;, &#8220;/var&#8221;, &#8230;) on any encrypted partition, and it also wouldn&#8217;t allow to encrypt, but not format a partition of type &#8220;LVM&#8221; for use as an LVM physical volume.</p>
<p>Both restrictions are now lifted; you can now create an LVM physical volume with encryption, or you can do the encryption layer on the logical volume if you prefer. And you can create an encrypted plain partition with a filesystem directly on it without LVM.</p>
<p>Over the years, Grub2 learned how to do that, so you don&#8217;t even need a /boot partition anymore. For the time being, you&#8217;ll need to enter the encryption password twice, though: once at the Grub2 prompt and once later at the graphical console so systemd can mount those filesystems. Our base system developers are working on a secure solution to avoid that.</p>
<h3>Migrate Travis CI to Docker</h3>
<p>That&#8217;s actually not a change in YaST itself, but in its development infrastructure. Still, we believe it would be interesting for the average reader of our blog.</p>
<p>So far we used Travis CI for building and testing the commits and pull requests at GitHub. But the problem was that by default Travis runs Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04 at the build workers. That had several drawbacks for us, since compiling and testing YaST on Ubuntu is not trivial and the result is not always 100% equivalent to openSUSE. All this meant extra maintenance work for us.</p>
<p>Fortunately Travis allows using Docker containers at the workers and that allows using basically any Linux distribution. This sprint we spent some time converting the Travis configuration to use a <i>dockerized</i> openSUSE Tumbleweed at Travis.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gh-tv-dck.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gh-tv-dck.png" alt="From Github to Travis thanks to Docker" width="400" height="131" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12281" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gh-tv-dck.png 400w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gh-tv-dck-300x98.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a></p>
<p>The work was successful, we switched all YaST modules to use this new builds and the result is already paying off at several levels, although it took us <a href="https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+user%3Ayast+docker+updated%3A%3E2017-01-12">over 100 pull requests</a> (all of them manually tweaked and reviewed) to make it happen.</p>
<p>The current solution <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/travis-integration/">is documented</a> and we had also a short internal presentation about this change. The notes from the presentation are <a href="https://gist.github.com/lslezak/ebf13dbf584685b6b86f5f3cc57ab9e7">available here</a>.</p>
<h3>Improved continuous integration for Snapper</h3>
<p>We also enabled Travis integration with Docker for <a href="http://snapper.io/">Snapper</a>. As you may know, Snapper is a portable software that has always offered packages for many Linux distributions in the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/filesystems:snapper/snapper">filesystems:snapper</a> OBS repository.</p>
<p>So we took the continuous integration one step further and enabled Travis builds on more distributions, currently we build for openSUSE Tumbleweed, openSUSE Leap 42.2, Fedora 25, Debian 8 and Ubuntu 16.10. You can see an <a href="https://travis-ci.org/openSUSE/snapper/builds/191720299">example build here</a> or more details in the <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/snapper/blob/master/README.Travis.md">documentation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapper-travis.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapper-travis-300x256.png" alt="Example build result of Snapper at Travis" width="300" height="256" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12283" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapper-travis-300x256.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapper-travis-768x657.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapper-travis.png 827w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>That means we can ensure that the package still builds on all these distributions even before merging a pull request!</p>
<h3>Better integration with systemd for YaST Services</h3>
<p>Systemd recognizes many possible states for a service beyond the classic Unix enabled/disabled and running/stopped, and that list of possible states grows with every systemd release. In the past YaST have had some issues displaying the services status.</p>
<p>Now the problems are fixed by delegating to systemd the conversion from the concrete state to the good old known Unix equivalent. So the user now gets more precise information about all services running on the system.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: redesigning the installation user experience</h3>
<p>In the latest post we showed you the document we were using as a base to discuss the new expert partitioner UI with usability experts. Now it was turn for the proposal settings dialog. We collected the current state, had a very productive discussion and ended up with a proposal for a new interface. You can check <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng/blob/master/doc/designing-proposal-settings-ui.md">the resulting document</a> covering all that.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the SUSE UX experts will use that document as a starting point to design the final interface. But we want the process to be as open as everything around YaST, so feel free to provide feedback.</p>
<h3>Reading product renaming information from libzypp</h3>
<p>When performing an upgrade, YaST needs to know whether a product is renamed or replaced by a another one. For example, in the past, the <i>Subscription Manager Tool</i> (SMT) lived in its own product but it&#8217;s included in SUSE Linux Enterprise 12. So YaST needs to know that the <code>suse-smt</code> product was just replaced by <code>sles</code>.</p>
<p>This information is usually provided by the SUSE Customer Center (SCC). But what happens if, for example, we are performing an offline upgrade? Until now, YaST used a <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-packager/blob/27e42b1a0b0f4f05eda241fe3a71610c18dd05aa/src/modules/AddOnProduct.rb#L139">hard-coded fallback list</a>.</p>
<p>From now on, before falling back to such a list, YaST will ask libzypp for that information so, hopefully, it will avoid some problems while upgrading extensions and it will reduce the hassle of maintaining a hard-coded list.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: Making sure to install storage-related packages</h3>
<p>The YaST storage subsystem has been taking care about storage-related software packages for a long time. For example, when a specific filesystem type like Btrfs or XFS is used by the system, we need to make sure that necessary support packages like <code>btrfsprogs</code> or <code>xfsprogs</code> are installed.</p>
<p>Figuring out what features are used is now done by the new libstorage. In this sprint, we created one <a href="https://github.com/shundhammer/yast-storage-ng/blob/master/src/lib/y2storage/used_storage_features.rb">Ruby class</a> that maps those features to respective packages and <a href="https://github.com/shundhammer/yast-storage-ng/blob/master/src/lib/y2storage/package_handler.rb">one class</a> that handles package installation itself. One interesting technical aspect is how Ruby introspection capacities are used to avoid duplicating the list of defined features from the C++ part (i.e. libstorage).</p>
<h3>Power the chameleon</h3>
<p>Apart from all those changes in YaST, and many more we have not included in this summary, we have something else to celebrate. On February 1st the YaST Team at SUSE has grown with the addition of a new member, Iván, who will allow the project to evolve even faster and better&#8230; and that will not be the last announcement in that direction, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t forget you can also help YaST, and openSUSE in general, to keep moving. This week we added several ideas for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> projects to the <a href="http://101.opensuse.org/">openSUSE mentoring page</a>, including one idea to contribute to YaST. Do you have a better plan for this summer?</p>
<p>See you in less than three weeks, since the next sprint will be slightly shorter due to <a href="http://101.opensuse.org/">Hack Week 15</a>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>It&#8217;s Christmas time and since (open)SUSE users have been nice, the YaST team brings some gifts for them. This is the result of the last development sprint of 2016.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, in the latest sprints we have been focusing more and more in making SUSE CASP possible. That&#8217;s even more obvious in this last sprint of the year. For those that have not been following this blog recently, it&#8217;s probably worth to remember that SUSE CASP will be a <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> based Container As a Service Platform.</p>
<p>But our daily work goes beyond CASP, so let&#8217;s take a look to all the highlights.</p>
<h3>More improvements in the management of DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/12/02/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-28/">previous report</a> we presented the changes introduced in yast2-network to make the configuration parameter <code>DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME</code> configurable in a per-interface basis.</p>
<p>One of the great things about working in an agile an iterative way, presenting and evaluating the result every three weeks, is that it allows us to detect room for improvements in our work. In this case we noticed some discrepancy in the expectations of Linuxrc and yast2-network and also some room for improvement in the code documentation and in the help texts.</p>
<p>Thus, we used this sprint to refine the work done in the previous one and tackle those problems down.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shot_error_start.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shot_error_start-300x225.png" alt="Improved error message" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12184" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shot_error_start-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shot_error_start.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Ensure installation of needed packages</h3>
<p>Another example of iterative development. We already presented in the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/10/20/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-26/">report of the 26th development sprint</a> a new mechanism to detect when the user had deselected during installation some package that was previously pre-selected by YaST in order to install the bootloader. Since the new functionality proved to work nicely, we decided to extend it to cover other parts of the system beyond the bootloader.</p>
<p>The software proposal now contains an error message including a list of missing packages or patterns, in case the user deselects some needed items.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/missing_software_warning.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/missing_software_warning-300x225.png" alt="Warning about missing packages" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12220" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/missing_software_warning-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/missing_software_warning-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/missing_software_warning.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>After clicking the <code>Install</code> button the installation is blocked, the user must resolve the problem either by selecting the packages back or by adjusting the respective YaST configuration (e.g. do not install any bootloader and disable the firewall).</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/missing_software_popup.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/missing_software_popup-300x225.png" alt="Blocking an incomplete installation" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12221" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/missing_software_popup-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/missing_software_popup-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/missing_software_popup.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Rethinking the expert partitioner</h3>
<p>May we insist one more time on the topic of using Scrum to organize our work in an iterative way? 😉 As our usual readers should already know, we structure the work into minimal units that produce a valuable outcome called <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2007/march/glossary-of-scrum-terms#1130">PBIs</a> in Scrum jargon. That valuable outcome doesn&#8217;t always have to be a piece of software, an implemented feature or a fixed bug. Sometimes a document adds value to YaST, specially if it can be used as base to collaborate with people outside the team.</p>
<p>Our readers also know that we are putting a lot of effort in rewriting the whole storage layer of YaST. That also implies rewriting the most powerful tool known by humanity to define partitions, volumes, RAIDs and similar stuff &#8211; the YaST expert partitioner.</p>
<p>It would be great if we could use the opportunity to make it both more powerful and more usable. You can take the first part for granted, but we are not so sure about our UI design skills. That&#8217;s why we wanted to have a base to discuss possible changes and alternative approaches with UX (user experience) experts. And we decided that it was worth to invest some time to create a document collecting the state of the art and some ideas for the future and to send that to SUSE experts in UX and to anybody with some interest in the topic.</p>
<p>Here you can find <a href="https://github.com/shundhammer/huha-misc-docs/blob/master/brainstorming-expert-partitioner.md">that fine piece of documentation</a>. Take a look to that document if you want to peek into YaST developers&#8217; mind. That&#8217;s the kind of stuff we discuss when we are about to start rewriting something&#8230; specially something that need to serve hundreds of different use cases.</p>
<p>And of course we would like to know your ideas or thoughts. We usually discuss this stuff at the public <a href="irc://irc.opensuse.org/yast">#yast IRC channel</a> and at the <a href="https://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/">yast-devel</a> mailing list. But if you prefer so, you can simply <a href="https://github.com/shundhammer/huha-misc-docs/issues">open an issue</a> at the repository hosting the document. Whatever works for you.</p>
<h3>Rethinking yast2-network</h3>
<p>But that was not the only documentation PBI finished during this sprint. Inspired by the first fruits of the storage layer reimplementation, we decided yast2-network also deserves a reincarnation.</p>
<p>As we did in the past with yast2-storage and libstorage, the first step is to collect as much information as possible about what can be currently done with the module and how it behaves in several situations, specially in tricky or complex scenarios. The outcome was three documents, one about the behavior during installation (<a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-network/blob/master/doc/installation.md">installation.md</a>), a second one about AutoYaST (<a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-network/blob/master/doc/autoinstallation.md">autoinstallation.md</a>) and another collecting general features (<a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-network/blob/master/doc/features.md">features.md</a>).</p>
<h3>CASP: merged dialogs for root password and keyboard layout</h3>
<p>CASP is a product targeted to a quite specific use case with simplicity as a main priority. The installation process has been streamlined to a minimal set of dialogs to configure just the very basic stuff. Among other removed things, there is no step to configure the system language. That can be a problem when entering the root password (the only user that will be created during installation), since the language settings screen is normally also used to select the keyboard layout.</p>
<p>The implemented solution is shown in the screenshot below. As you can see, the keyboard layout and root passwords selections are merged into a single step. As a bonus, we made both widgets more reusable, opening the possibility to place the root password widget or the keyboard layout selection anywhere.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/keyboard_and_root.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/keyboard_and_root-300x223.png" alt="Keyboard layout and root password screen" width="300" height="223" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12204" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/keyboard_and_root-300x223.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/keyboard_and_root-768x572.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/keyboard_and_root-1024x762.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/keyboard_and_root.png 1028w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: handling GPT disks in the installation proposal</h3>
<p>After several sprints reporting small steps forward, in the 27th sprint we were <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/12/02/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-28/">happy to announce</a> that our testing ISO for the new storage stack was fully installable under certain circumstances. As we reported, it worked in UEFI or legacy systems with the only requirement of having a pre-existing MBR partition table in the disk.</p>
<p>Now we can say it also works with GPT partition tables and even with systems with a mixture of both technologies.</p>
<p>Making the GPT scenario work was much harder that it sounds due to several factors, like the strange way in which <code>parted</code> handles partition types in GPT or some peculiarities in the way the space is distributed in such partition tables.</p>
<p>But now our test ISO can install a fully functional system in the four combinations of MBR/GPT partition table and UEFI/Legacy boot, as it can be seen in the next image.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/proposal.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/proposal-133x300.png" alt="Storage proposal in several scenarios" width="133" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12193" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/proposal-133x300.png 133w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/proposal-455x1024.png 455w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/proposal.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px" /></a></p>
<h3>The storage reimplementation gets its own openQA instance</h3>
<p>But there are better ways than screenshots to prove that something is working, even to prove it keeps working after future modifications. And in (open)SUSE we have one of the best tools for that &#8211; openQA.</p>
<p>We have always considered having the new stack tested in openQA as the first big milestone in its development (and we are finally there!) but we are aware that <a href="http://openqa.opensuse.org/">openQA.opensuse.org</a> is already quite busy testing a huge combination of products, architectures and scenarios&#8230; even testing releases of openQA itself. Fortunately openQA is free software and can be installed anywhere so we created our own instance of openQA to test YaST stuff, specially the new storage layer.</p>
<p>So far, that instance is hosted in the internal SUSE network, which is enough for us to get continuous feedback about the changes we introduce. In addition to installing the new instance and configuring it to continuously grab and check the <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/storage-ng/images/iso/">latest testing ISO</a>, we had to introduce several changes in the ISO itself with the goal of keeping our tests as aligned as possible with the tests performed in the current Tumbleweed version by openQA.opensuse.org.</p>
<p>For example, we made sure the ISO was properly signed to avoid the need to always pass the <code>insecure=1</code> boot argument. We also included several packages that were missing in order to make sure the ISO included all the software checked during the so-called MinimalX test and to make sure it shared the look and feel with a regular Tumbleweed, since many openQA checks are screenshot-based.</p>
<p>From now on, we can back every new feature with the corresponding integration tests, something crucial to ensure the quality of a piece of software meant to handle storage hardware.</p>
<h3>Making Snapper work without DBus</h3>
<p>As you may know, some YaST team members are also the main developers and maintainers of <a href="http://snapper.io/">Snapper</a>, the ultimate file-system snapshot tool for GNU/Linux systems.</p>
<p>Normally the <code>snapper</code> command line tool uses <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/">DBus</a> to connect to <code>snapperd</code> which does most of the actual work. This allows non-root users to work with snapper.</p>
<p>There are however situations when using DBus is not possible and not being able to work in those situations was limiting Snapper&#8217;s usefulness. Now with the latest version all snapper commands support the <code>–no-dbus</code> option. This evolution is worth a blog post by itself&#8230; and, of course, we have it. To know all the details <a href="http://snapper.io/2016/12/19/no-dbus-for-all.html">check this post</a> at Snapper&#8217;s blog.</p>
<h3>CASP (and beyond): improved roles</h3>
<p>Do you remember the system roles feature introduced during <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/03/15/highlights-of-development-sprint-16/">development sprint 16</a> and improved in subsequent sprints? In case you don&#8217;t, let us remind you that system roles allow to define many settings of the installation just by choosing one of the offered roles. That&#8217;s only possible, of course, in products making use of that feature, like SLES.</p>
<p>For CASP we will have 3 different roles, as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp_roles.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp_roles-300x225.png" alt="CASP system roles" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12208" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp_roles-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp_roles-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp_roles.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The main difference between these three roles is the selection of patterns to be installed. But apart from that, the Worker role will offer an extra step during installation allowing the user to specify the address of the so-called Administration Dashboard.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/worker_configuration.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/worker_configuration-300x225.png" alt="Configuration screen for the Worker role" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12209" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/worker_configuration-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/worker_configuration-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/worker_configuration.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>That relatively small detail implied the development of a full new feature in the installer &#8211; the ability of a given role to define it&#8217;s own specific configuration, including the dialog to interact with the user. As expected from any other installation dialog, you can go back and forward without loosing the entered information. If the user goes back and selects a different role, then this additional dialog is not run again.</p>
<p>That new feature is, of course, not specific to CASP and could eventually be used in other products and roles. Just as a crazy example, openSUSE could decide to introduce a role called &#8220;NTP server&#8221;, running the YaST NTP server configuration right after the user selecting the role.</p>
<h3>Other CASP related features</h3>
<p>As already said, we have been focusing quite a lot on introducing features that are needed for CASP. It&#8217;s worth mentioning, in case it&#8217;s still unclear, that CASP will NOT ship its own adapted version of YaST. All the features introduced in the installer are in fact configurable and available for all other products as well. There is only one YaST codebase to rule them all.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s briefly describe some of the introduced CASP-specific (at least for the time being) features.</p>
<p>CASP always uses Btrfs as filesystem for the root partition. At the end of the installation, the root btrfs subvolume will become read-only. All the other subvolumes will stay as read-write, as shown in this screenshot taken right after rebooting at the end of the installation process.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-root-read-only-02.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-root-read-only-02-300x237.png" alt="CASP subvolumes" width="300" height="237" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12213" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-root-read-only-02-300x237.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-root-read-only-02-768x606.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-root-read-only-02-1024x808.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-root-read-only-02.png 1034w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>It makes no sense to update from any existing product to CASP. Thus, CASP media should not show an &#8220;update&#8221; option when booting, even if it&#8217;s still possible for advanced users to pass the <code>UPDATE</code> boot parameter. Since we needed to modify the <code>installation-images</code> package, we took the opportunity to make the &#8220;update&#8221; option and other settings configurable in a per product basis and we unified SLES and openSUSE packages, so now they share a single branch in the source code repository.</p>
<p>CASP is targeted to big deployments extended all over the world. To make possible the synchronization of geographically distributed nodes, the UTC timezone is enforced in every CASP installation. Thus, we implemented support for products to enforce a given timezone in the installer. Take into account this is different from a default timezone.</p>
<p>Last but not least, it has already been mentioned that the CASP installation workflow will have very few steps. That also affects the screen displaying the installations settings summary. In comparison to a regular SLES, some options must disappear because they are not configurable and some other sections must be added because they are not longer presented as a separate previous step. So far, this is the appearance of the installation settings screen in the current CASP prototype.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/summary.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/summary-290x300.png" alt="Installation settings in CASP prototype" width="290" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12214" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/summary-290x300.png 290w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/summary-768x796.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/summary.png 949w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /></a></p>
<h3>&#8230;and a surprise about the blog</h3>
<p>We also prepared a Christmas gift related to the blog. The technical aspects are solved, but we are ironing out the administrative details. So you will have to wait until the next sprint report to see it in full glory. But, as the Spanish proverb says, &#8220;good things are worth waiting for&#8221;.</p>
<h3>See you next year</h3>
<p>That&#8217;s enough to report from our December sprint, we don&#8217;t want to bore you with every small bug fix. And talking about things that are worth waiting for, our next report will very likely be published at the beginning of February 2017.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because we will put our Scrum process on hold during the Christmas session. We will restart it on the second week of the year, after the visit of the Three Wise Men. In several countries, it&#8217;s a tradition that the Three Kings bring gifts to the kids that have been nice, so let&#8217;s expect they bring us some new members for the team!</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>November is over, Santa Claus elves start to stress and the YaST team brings you one of the last reports of 2016. Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s new in YaSTland.</p>
<h3>Harder to ignore installation warning</h3>
<p>The &#8220;installation settings&#8221; summary screen usually reports some non-critical errors displayed as a red text. Although the installation can proceed despite those errors, they are usually serious enough to lead to problems. That&#8217;s why we decided to introduce a change to highlight them a little bit more, making them harder to overlook.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the newly introduced confirmation dialog, presented before proceeding with installation.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/warn.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/warn-300x227.png" alt="Preventing users to shoot their feet" width="300" height="227" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12152" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/warn-300x227.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/warn-768x582.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/warn-1024x776.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/warn.png 1027w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Make DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME configurable on a per-interface basis</h3>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the only usability-oriented enhancement on this sprint. We also reworked a bit the network configuration dialog.</p>
<p>For home users is very common to use a fixed hostname -set during installation- for our beloved linux box. But in some circumstances it&#8217;s better to set the hostname of the machine dynamically using DHCP, something YaST has always allowed to do by just ticking a checkbox that used to be in the network configuration screen. See &#8220;Change Hostname via DHCP&#8221; below.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/old-network.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/old-network-300x225.png" alt="The old network settings screen" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12162" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/old-network-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/old-network.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>That checkbox used to modify the system-wide variable <code>DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME</code>, which was fine in scenarios in which only one of the network interfaces was configured via DHCP. But with several network interfaces connected to different DHCP-enabled networks, some problems arose.</p>
<p>During installation, if network configuration is used, <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Linuxrc">Linuxrc</a> creates the <code>ifcfg</code> files with <code>DHCLIENT_SET_HOSTNAME='yes'</code> for all of the enabled or configured interfaces and this value has precedence over the global one.</p>
<p>So the main problem was that YaST only allowed us to modify the global variable and setting it to &#8216;no&#8217; did nothing because it was enabled for some interface.</p>
<p>During this sprint we have fixed that and now the user interface offers the possibility of choosing which DHCP interface will be used to decide the hostname.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/new-network.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/new-network-300x225.png" alt="The new network settings screen" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12163" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/new-network-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/new-network.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Apart from choosing one of the existing interfaces, the new setting can also be set to &#8216;no&#8217; or to &#8216;any&#8217;. In any case, YaST will always configure the system-wide options and the interface specific ones in a consistent way, so the behavior is always predictable.</p>
<p>But YaST is not the only way of configuring the network, so it&#8217;s always possible to have an unpredictable configuration. Fortunately, those potentially problematic scenarios will be detected by YaST and reported to the user.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/any-network.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/any-network-300x225.png" alt="Detecting dangerous scenarios in network settings" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12164" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/any-network-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/any-network.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Partitioning in CASP</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/11/10/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-27/">previous report</a> we already explained how are we improving the installer to support the definition of the ultra-streamlined installation process of SUSE CASP, the new <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> based member of the SUSE family.</p>
<p>In this sprint we introduced several additional changes to enable a different partitioning approach, more guided and automatic than ever. In a CASP node it makes no sense to use the advanced settings offered by our storage proposal, like encryption or LVM. Moreover, CASP relies on Btrfs to provide some of its cool and advanced features, like transactional updates.</p>
<p>As a result, although the regular SUSE and openSUSE releases will keep offering all the current possibilities in the same way than ever, in CASP the partitioning step will be skipped and the automatically calculated proposal will be simply displayed in the installation summary.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-installation-summary.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-installation-summary-300x186.png" alt="The new CASP installation summary" width="300" height="186" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12170" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-installation-summary-300x186.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-installation-summary-768x477.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-installation-summary-1024x636.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-installation-summary.png 1356w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Clicking on the proposal will allow to re-target the installation to a different disk (or disks) in a similar way than the regular installer, but the options will be more limited. Again, no easy way to use LVM, encryption, separate home or any file system type other than Btrfs.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-select-partitions.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-select-partitions-300x186.png" alt="Selecting the partitions in CASP, no proposal settings button" width="300" height="186" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12171" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-select-partitions-300x186.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-select-partitions-768x477.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-select-partitions-1024x635.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-select-partitions.png 1352w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The expert partitioner is still available during CASP installation, but using it will show an extra warning, since it implies a much bigger risk than using it in a regular SUSE or openSUSE system.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-expert-partitioner-warning.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-expert-partitioner-warning-300x186.png" alt="Expert partitioner warning in CASP" width="300" height="186" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12172" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-expert-partitioner-warning-300x186.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-expert-partitioner-warning-768x477.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-expert-partitioner-warning-1024x636.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/casp-expert-partitioner-warning.png 1352w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Improved debugger integration</h3>
<p>We have improved the Ruby debugger integration in YaST. So far you could start the debugger using the <code>y2debugger=1</code> boot option or by setting the <code>Y2DEBUGGER=1</code> environment variable. The new feature allows starting the Ruby debugger also later when the YaST module is already running.</p>
<p>Simply press the <code>Shift+Ctrl+Alt+D</code> keyboard shortcut (<code>D</code> as debug) and it will start the Ruby debugger. It works during installation and also in installed system (just make sure the <code>byebug</code> Ruby gem is installed).</p>
<p>Unfortunately this new feature works only in the Qt UI, the ncurses UI is not supported (currently it does not handle the debugging keyboard shortcut at all).</p>
<p>After pressing the keyboard shortcut the debugger window will pop up:</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/debugger.gif" alt="New debugger integration" /></p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: it&#8217;s alive!</h3>
<p>It took us one more sprint than originally expected, but finally we can say the testing ISO for the new storage stack is fully installable.</p>
<p>We fixed the UEFI + MBR partition table scenario we already had almost working in the previous sprint (turns out it was not that broken in Tumbleweed after all) and we adapted yast2-bootloader to be also able to deal with legacy (i.e. no UEFI) booting using the new storage stack.</p>
<p>As a nice result, our testing ISO can be used to install a perfectly functional system in both UEFI or legacy systems with the only requirement of having a pre-existing MBR partition table in the disk. It only shows a couple of error pop-ups related to the calculation of the proposal of software to be installed, but nothing that would prevent you from replacing whatever operating system you have with a new shiny openSUSE-based experiment.</p>
<p>This milestone opens the door to start testing the new stack with openQA, the same system that helps to guarantee the robustness of all the recent SUSE and openSUSE versions.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: preparations for the storage proposal</h3>
<p>Now that yast2-bootloader starts to be ready to work with the new storage stack in more and more scenarios, it&#8217;s time to adapt the only component that still complains during the installation. </p>
<p>In order to make that task doable during the next sprint, we invested some time in this sprint analyzing the interaction between the software proposal calculator and the old storage layer. The outcome was <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng/blob/master/doc/software-requirements.md">a small document</a> detailing what needs to be adapted in the proposal and in the new stack. The perfect input for a task in the next sprint.</p>
<h3>Help for power-users with short memory</h3>
<p>Our beloved YaST is packed with <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:YaST_tricks">magic tricks</a> below the surface. Many of them are very useful to debug installation problems or to better understand how the YaST internals work. Unfortunately developers tend to not be that good at blindly memorizing stuff and the functionality is so well hidden that most newcomers would have hard times finding it&#8230; until now.</p>
<p>We have added a couple of new keyboard shortcuts to show a summary of all the advanced hotkeys, so now you only have to remember one key combination instead of a dozen of them. In both text (ncurses) and graphical (Qt) mode, it will be enough to press <code>shift+F1</code> to get the advanced help displayed below. Since some terminal emulators could already use that combination, <code>ctrl+D F1</code> can also be used in the ncurses interface as an alternative.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hotkey-help-qt.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hotkey-help-qt-300x268.png" alt="Advanced Hotkeys help dialog" width="300" height="268" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12167" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hotkey-help-qt-300x268.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hotkey-help-qt.png 589w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Contributions keep coming!</h3>
<p>As we have already mentioned in previous sprint reports, an important part of our daily job as open source developers is helping casual (and not so casual) contributors to bring their ideas and code into YaST and related projects.</p>
<p>This time that (hopefully not casual) contributor was <a href="https://github.com/dwaas">Devin Waas</a>, who wanted to improve the installation to make the life of cloud-lovers easier.</p>
<p>For cloud guys out there retrieving logs of a failed installation <del>is</del> was a huge problem. Now, thanks to Devin, all you need is a running a rsyslog server and you&#8217;ll be able to easily access your installation logs from there.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dvw.png" alt="A drawing is worth a thousand words" /></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the newest Tumbleweed release allows us to specify the IP address of a remote server from the bootloader through the &#8220;Loghost flag&#8221;. Linuxrc will take care of setting up a UDP broadcast for dmesg contents and YaST installation logs.</p>
<p>This is just a first step. Devin promised further improvements of our newly implemented remote logging system. And he codes better than he draws, so stay tuned! </p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: LVM-based proposal</h3>
<p>As we already mentioned in previous reports, when we started to develop the partitioning proposal we first focused in the scenario of a partition-based proposal with one or several MBR-style partition tables. That looked like the most complex scenario due to the limited number of primary partitions, the alignment problems, the overhead introduced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_boot_record">EBR (extended boot record)</a> of every logical partition and so on.</p>
<p>A couple of sprints ago, we got that working so we started to work on the LVM-based proposal. It took a little bit longer than expected but now we are able to generate LVM-based proposals for almost every possible scenario. The goal was to have them working in our mocked test cases. So probably the new LVM-based proposal cannot still be used to install a fully functional system, but it is backed by a full load of tests that prove we can handle many situations, from trivial to really tricky ones&#8230; and believe us, things can get quite tricky if you mix logical partitions with their EBR overhead and LVM volumes with their <a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/pe.html">PE size</a> rounding and their <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5/html/Logical_Volume_Manager_Administration/lvm_metadata.html">metadata</a> overhead.</p>
<h3>Bugs, bugs, bugs</h3>
<p>In this sprint we kept the already commented approach of making the fix of low-priority and small bugs part of the Scrum process. As a result we accounted for approximately 50 deaths of those annoying creatures.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Looking at the report, we could say it was a quite successful sprint. But to be honest we were aiming even higher. Quite some interesting PBIs (features or bug-fixes in Scrum jargon) were almost done at the end of the sprint. But following Scrum philosophy, we never blog about almost-done stuff.</p>
<p>Thus, if nothing goes wrong things will be even better in the next report in three weeks. So have a lot of fun trying the new stuff and stay tuned for more!</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>As promised in previous posts, we want to share with you our experience and views from this year annual Ruby conference <a href="http://euruko2016.org">Euruko</a>. Maybe &#8220;our&#8221; is too much to say, since we only sent one developer there. So to be precise, these are Josef Reidinger&#8217;s experience and views on the conference.</p>
<p>This year Euruko took place in Sofia, capital of Bulgaria. It turned out to be a great conference place. Public transport works very well, everyone speak English and even when it uses Cyrilic alphabet, almost everything is written also in Latin one.</p>
<p>That being said, let&#8217;s talk about the conference content. Fortunately all the presentations were recorded so you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChGs1td4ViQFqT0jlvkyUJg">watch them yourself</a>. But since it would be quite some hours of video to go through, we have reviewed some presentations for you including access to the corresponding videos.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the three presentation Josef specially recommend to watch.</p>
<p><b>Keynote by Matz</b></p>
<p>He speaks about how Ruby 3 will probably look in distant future. With &#8220;distant future&#8221; meaning &#8220;for sure not in next two years&#8221;. If you cannot wait, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that Ruby 2.4 will be released on December.</p>
<p>Ruby 3 will use guild membership concurrency model. The most interesting part of the talk is digging into rationale of typed versus non-typed languages and what can be the Ruby future in that regard.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8aHmArEq4y0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><b>Rules, Laws and Gently Guidelines by Andrew Radev</b></p>
<p>Interesting view about common design principles, common mistakes when applying them and looking to them from different angles. Also explaining how to handle situations in which several design principles seem to contradict each other.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BDXQ4pcbEBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><b>Elixir by Jose Valim</b></p>
<p>Interesting intro to Elixir language. What it is, why it make sense to use it and what are its benefits. Josef&#8217;s impression was that Elixir&#8217;s idea is similar to isolated micro-services communicating via messages, with nice introspection and scalability.</p>
<p>But we have more team members with something to say about Elixir. Like Imobach, who has been playing with Elixir (and <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a>) for some time now. And Imobach really likes Elixir, so he would like to add some more bits of information for those who are interested.</p>
<p>For example, he would like to highlight that Elixir uses BEAM, the Erlang virtual machine, so great support for concurrency is backed in the platform. Concurrency sits on the concept of Erlang processes and it&#8217;s pretty common to use them for all kind of tasks (from computation to storing state, etc.). Imobach would like to encourage all developers out there to take a look to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform">OTP (Open Telecom Platform)</a>. Who needs micro-services at all? </p>
<p>Last but not least, take into account that Elixir is a functional language, so if you have an object-oriented mindset (like most Ruby developers) it will take some time to wrap your head around it.</p>

<h3>Other presentations</h3>
<p><b>Little Snippets by Xavier Noria</b></p>
<p>Summary of common inefficiency in small snippets. Small things that matter, although most of them should be already known by the average Ruby developer. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC9TyVeER_8">Video</a>)</p>
<p>Since we mention the topic, some YaST team members has found <a href="https://github.com/JuanitoFatas/fast-ruby">this cheat sheet</a> by Juanito Fatas about Ruby optimization to be quite useful.</p>
<p><b>Rails + Kafka by Terence Lee</b></p>
<p>Apache Kafka is yet another messaging system. This talk did not manage to convince Josef to use it, but maybe it makes sense in some scenarios like HPC or HA. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl3JmF3n2bQ">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>Graphql on Rails by Marc-Andre Giroux</b></p>
<p>The typical REST setup is sometimes not scalable enough due to the excess of endpoints. The Graphql language is designed to specify what resources are needed from a server in a single query. The result is returned as JSON and the request specification looks also similar to JSON. Caching is done on client side. Interesting for web stuff and already used by Facebook, Shopify and others. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V96jduEvjY">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>Evolution of engineering on call team by Grace Chang</b></p>
<p>How to maintain services, how to scale when the grow, preventing burnout and so on. Specially interesting for us since there are many similarities with YaST maintenance. Maybe the end of the talk is a bit theoretic and idealistic. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_7wrPXaSto">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>Sprockets by Rafael Franca</b></p>
<p>Not specially interesting intro to assets generation used by Rails. People doing some assets generation with Rails would most likely already know all the content. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbM_1wRVfeI">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>Contribute to Ruby core by Hiroshi Shibata</b></p>
<p>Presentation about Ruby core development infrastructure, rules, etc. Certainly not the best talk ever. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRfsakcZJKw">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>Consequences of insightful algorithms by Carina C. Zona</b></p>
<p>Interesting presentation about conflicts between algorithms and real humans, especially with data-mining. Unfortunately, the second half turned to be too emotional and not technical enough for Josef&#8217;s taste :). (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bp4yFKw_1QM">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>Viewing Ruby Blossom &#8211; Hamani by Anton Davydov</b></p>
<p>Introduction to yet another Ruby web framework. Not that interesting for us. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L6I4UoK8xM">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>A Year of Ruby, Together by Andre Arko</b></p>
<p>Introduction on how the open source community infrastructure behind Rubygems and Bundler is ran. How they get money to improve stuff, how they maintain their servers&#8230; Good talk about hard times keeping open source infrastructure alive. Interesting talk for any open source project. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJddsEfvcW8">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>What I Have Learned from Organizing Remote Internship for Ruby Developers by Ivan Nemytchenko</b></p>
<p>Talk describing an attempt to scale internship for a lot of students. Josef had a small chat with the author about Google Summer of Code after the presentation. He looked interested. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-K0ZKOclBU">Video</a>)</p>
<p><b>The Illusion of Stable APIs by Nick Sutterer</b></p>
<p>Not Josef&#8217;s cup of tea. The presenter probably went a little bit too far trying to be funny all the time. The core of the presentation was about three examples of API that needed to be changed &#8220;just&#8221; because the rest of the world changed. So the whole presentation can be shortened to one sentence &#8211; your API will only remain static if the world remains static. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvHwTtsIH8g">Video</a>)</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>That was all from Sofia. See you again in approximately one week, just in time for the report of our 28th Scrum sprint.</p>
