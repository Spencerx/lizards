I can code with javascript and I&#8217;m fairly good at it (not marvelous just brialiant!). If you have read some of my resent <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/15/opensuse-and-gcc-part-2/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 2: compiling ‘Hello World’">blog</a> <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/11/12/opensuse-and-gcc-part-6/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 6: Introduction to autotools">post</a> I think in C/C++/Perl or Bash. I also have some kind of a hobby to help out with <a href="http://unrealworld.fi">UnReal world RPG</a> game. Mostly my part is to make it work with *nix platform (mainly Linux and Mac OS X).<br />
As we have seen world is moving fast forward towards web. It&#8217;s  the-place-to-be for everyone. There is huge potential for players just wandering around and yelling for pleasure to play UrW! So I thought let&#8217;s see if we could port SDL to javascript/Flash or something straight from same source. after tiny amount of searching I popped up <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten" title="Emscripten">Emscripten</a>.<span id="more-10686"></span></p>
<h2>Emscripten in nutshell</h2>
<p>Emscripten is stated in their Github page (which seems to be only place to reach this project) like this:</p>
<pre>
Emscripten is an LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler. It takes LLVM bitcode - which can be generated from C/C++, using llvm-gcc or clang, or any other language that can be converted into LLVM - and compiles that into JavaScript, which can be run on the web (or anywhere else JavaScript can run).
</pre>
<p>So in other words you can your existing C++ or C source code and compile it (with minor changes) to javascript pseudocode with LLVM back-end. I thought it can&#8217;t be working and started digging further.</p>
<h2>How to test it on openSUSE</h2>
<p>If you have openSUSE 12.3 or above you are good to go or you need to install LLVM 3.2 or above from OBS. You can do it with zypper like this:</p>
<pre>
zypper install llvm llvm-devel llvm-clang llvm-clang-devel git nodejs
</pre>
<p>Ain&#8217;t Clang just another C-compiler? So why not use GCC? Answer is  LLVM is very flexible system (GCC is kinda married to C/C++. even there is many other backends) that turns code to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" title="Abstract syntax tree">Abstract syntax tree</a> and then back-end compiles it to binary (which can anything from machine code to some of your favorite byte code like Java/C#). So in other words you have parser (clang) and you write back-end to generate code (javascript) quite easily (in theory). I think it was kind idea behind GCC in version 3.0 but as said it doesn&#8217;t work as seamlessly as it works in LLVM. Another strong point with LLVM is license. (L)GPL is fine license but if you have compiler you license should be as free as it gets.</p>
<h2>So HOW TO TEST IT?</h2>
<p>I haven&#8217;t got time to make rpm-package from Emscripten because I&#8217;m still learning by myself but I&#8217;ll share now what I have learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">Read documentatio</a>n</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/Tutorial">Read documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://kripken.github.io/clangor/demo.html">Read documentation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok now you have read Emscripten documentation and you have clang, nodejs and git installed. Clone the Emscripten Git-repo</p>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/kripken/emscripten.git
</pre>
<p>If you just want to test something you can follow this tutorial: <a href="http://sol.gfxile.net/emscripten/">http://sol.gfxile.net/emscripten/</a> so you get the idea. This how far I&#8217;ll take you this time. I&#8217;ll figure out some SDL examples to be ported (since UnReal World RPG uses SDL) in near future so stay tuned. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have time to setup real solution and need something reliable test Zabbix (<a href="http://zabbix.com" title="Zabbix">http://zabbix.com</a>). Zabbix is wonderful all in one solutions for monitoring network and your hosts (servers). If you are in need of knowing how good you Internet/(W)LAN connections is then things are getting complicated.<span id="more-10639"></span><br />
Case is like this: You have computer and WIFI-card (Wireless Internet card). Most of the time it&#8217;s working great! Speed is high and there is no hick-ups any kind. Out of the blue comes troubles. In other network video is not playing from net or you keep getting connection errors in browser.. so what to do? How to debug this one? It can be that other people are just consuming all the router bandwidth available or there is many WIFI routers in same frequency (be sure to check first all the hardware before getting into software level). If hardware is not the case and you have double checked with normal Wire connection to Internet/LAN then there is definitely something else. With WIFI connection it still can be your grandma’s old beloved 1950 microwave oven (If you on 5Ghz band then you can&#8217;t blame her either)..<br />
So I assume you are on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP" title="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a>-network if you don&#8217;t know what it is you should first find out and then read the rest of this story.<br />
WIFI-cards have signal strength monitor. I have notice that many times it&#8217;s just a estimation. You can have 100% strength and your connection is next to nothing. Manufacturers tends to make connections look way too better than they are or they make them look even worst than they are.<br />
So how to find out is my connection good or bad? Word of warning in this point: this is just one way to find out and it&#8217;s not very good (for some use cases it is). Way is to use little bit BASH (Bourne Again SHell) and <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Ping-in-Linux" title="ping">ping-command</a> which is installed in openSUSE default.</p>
<h2>What ping does</h2>
<p>Ping consumes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol" title="ICMP">ICMP-protocol</a> which is very low level and I don&#8217;t know is it used for anything anymore these days (correct me if I&#8217;m very wrong) only with ping-command. If Wikipedia is correct ping calculates round-trip so how long takes data to find it&#8217;s way to server and come back (Small tip here! You can use <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/unix/utracero.htm" title="Traceroute">traceroute</a> to see how you packet is finding it&#8217;s way on the Internet and back to you).<br />
So how can I use ping to tell me is my server up? Short answer is simple: &#8216;you can&#8217;t&#8217;. Little bit longer answer: &#8216;Yes you can but it&#8217;s little bit more complicated than you first thought&#8217; and the long version: &#8216;You get information about if your server&#8217;s network card answers to (and most of the time kernel network stack) received ICMP-packet. If there is firewall rule that turns ICMP-packet answer off you are out of luck. Ping doesn&#8217;t tell if your service is up or Apache running correctly and reliable. Remember ping answer can work even if most of user space is smashed down and kernel is malfunctioning (been there done that!)&#8217;.<br />
So what you get it answer from network card and that&#8217;s it. If it&#8217;s enough (99% times it is) keep reading.</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>Show me code you scream and I give it to you and please read comments on code before using. This is edited version from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18258364/ping-tool-to-check-if-server-is-online" title="Stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow.com</a> message script (so nothing original here):</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

echo "Press [CTRL+C] to stop.."

# Make at least 10 pings in one time
COUNT=50
SUCCESS=0
LASTFAIL=NONE
# Change this to Domain name/IP
# or ip you want to monitor
IP=192.168.1.1
FAILS=0

while true
do
        #
        # Ping with interval 0.5s to IP (192.168.1.1)
        # COUNT (50) times
        # after that we just grep 'byte from' from output
        # or ping and them calculate how many we got
        # with wc -l (Lines of output) bacause we drop
        # other from output
        # You can use up (normally) 2000 size (-s) of package
        # to see if it's starts to drop..
        LINES=$(ping -s 1024 -i 0.5 -c ${COUNT} ${IP} | \
                grep "bytes from ${SERVERSERVER}" | wc -l)

        # Calculate how many fails there were
        let FAILS=${COUNT}-${LINES}+${FAILS}
        # Add to success rate
        let SUCCESS=${LINES}+${SUCCESS}

        # If there were error but date to LASTFAIL
        # so if you not every moment looking you can
        # see when this error happened
        if [ ${LINES} -ne ${COUNT} ]; then
             LASTFAIL=$(date)
        fi

        # Ok ping all together failed
        if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then
          echo "Can't Connect to server ${IP}"
        else
          # Print statistics to screen
          echo "$(date) ${IP} Success: ${LINES} (Tot. F ${FAILS}) \
(Tot. S ${SUCCESS}) (Last F ${LASTFAIL})"
        fi

        # Sleep a while (not consume all the bandwidth)
        sleep 1
done
</pre>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Script prints mystical output. Things that matters that Success rate is 50 (or what pinging rate you are using) and Fails are not rising fast. It they are rising fast packets are dropped if you are not getting anything check IP/domain name. With this one you can get ping time. If success level is 50 but ping time is high you network is still very slow but that you have to check with ping-command by hand. Even with 2G mobile modem you should get under 300ms (3G should be like 100ms).<br />
To have any clue about your connection you have make this at least 30 minutes (First ping packets can tell everything but if you want to see whole picture). Actually this is stupid way to find out is your server up but if your WIFI-card  is working everywhere else great you can check are you packets going through. If ICMP-packets are dropping very fast then your TCP/IP packages are dropping very fast and you network stack have to re-send them so you notice that your network is slow (even though it has nothing to do with that). Again it can be route, WIFI-card or firewall problem still.. and ping doesn&#8217;t answer to that question. So this was this days script stuff. If you have better ways to do this.. please share I&#8217;m always interested in this topic.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you might know, we are focusing our development efforts in two fronts, namely <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2014-01/msg00317.html">openQA</a> and <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2014-01/msg00278.html">staging projects</a>. As we just started we don&#8217;t have fireworks for you (yet) but we did some solid ground work that we are going to build upon.</p>
<h3>Working on openQA</h3>
<p>We are organizing our daily job in openQA into highly focused sprints of two weeks. The focus of the first sprint was clear: cleanup the current codebase to empower future development and lower the entry barrier for casual contributors, which can be translated as &#8220;cleaning our own mess&#8221;. We created <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/67">some tasks in progress</a>, grouped in a version with a surprising and catchy name: Sprint 01.</p>
<h4>Got my mojo workin&#8217;</h4>
<p>Up to now, openQA web interface was written using just a bunch of custom CGI scripts and some configuration directives in Apache. We missed a convenient way to access to all the bell and whistles of modern web development and some tools to make the code more readable, reliable and easier to extend and test. In short, we missed a proper web development framework. We evaluated the most popular Perl-based alternatives and we finally decided to go for <a href="http://mojolicio.us/">Mojolicious</a> for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides all the functionality we demand from a web framework while being lightweight and unbloated.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s stated as a &#8220;real time framework&#8221; which, buzzwords apart, means that is designed from the ground to fully support Comet (long-polling), EventSource and WebSockets. Very handy technologies for implementing some features in openQA.</li>
<li>It really &#8220;feels&#8221; very close to <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>, which makes Ruby on Rails     developers feel like at home. And we have quite some Rails developers hanging around, don&#8217;t we? Just think about OBS, software.o.o, WebYast, progress.o.o, OSEM, the TSP app&#8230;
<li>Mojolicious motto is &#8220;web development can be fun again&#8221;. Who could resist to that?</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ve now reached the end of the sprint and we already have something that looks exactly the same than what we had before, but using Mojolicious internally. We are very happy with the framework and we are pretty confident that future development of openQA will be easier and faster than ever. OpenQA has mojo!</p>
<h4>The database layer in openQA</h4>
<p>Another part that we worked on during first sprint was the database layer. The user interface part of openQA use a SQLite database to store the jobs and workers registered in the system. The connection between the code and the database was expressed directly in SQL using a simple API.</p>
<p>We have replaced this layer with another equivalent that uses an ORM (Object-relational mapping) in Perl (<a href="http://www.dbix-class.org/">DBIx::Class</a>). Every data model in openQA is now a true object that can be created, copied and moved between the different layers of the application. Quite handy.</p>
<p>To make sure we don&#8217;t forget anything, we created a bunch of tests covering the whole functionality of the original code, running this test suite after each step of the migration. In this way we have achieved two goals: we now have a simple way to share and update information through the whole system and we can migrate very easily to a different database engine (something that we plan to do in the future).</p>
<h3>What to do with staging</h3>
<p>Over the time, coolo had accumulated quite some scripts that helped him with Factory. Most of them are actually related to something we are doing right now: the staging projects. So in the end we basically migrated all relevant ones to <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory">github</a> and one by one we are merging their functionality to staging plugin. We also experimented with test frameworks that we could use to test the plugin itself, selected few and we even have a first test! The final plan is to have the whole plugin functionality covered with a proper test suite, so we will know when something breaks. Currently, there is a lot of mess in our repo and the plugin itself need big cleanup, but we are working on it.</p>
<h3>Contributions are welcome</h3>
<p>If you want to help but wonder where to start, we identified tasks that are good to dive into the topic and named them &#8220;easy hacks&#8221;: mostly self contained tasks we expect to have little effort but we lack the time to do right now. Just jump over the list for <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/73">openQA</a> or <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/69">staging projects</a>.</p>
<p>For grabbing the code related to staging project, you only need to clone the <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory">already mentioned repository</a>. The openQA code is spread in several repositories (<a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/openQA">two</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse">three</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst-needles-opensuse">four</a>), but setting up your own instance to play and hack is a piece of cake using <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/openQA">the packages</a> available in OBS (built automatically for every git push).</p>
<p>If you simply want to see what we are doing in more detail, take a look at progress.o.o, we have both <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqav3">openQA</a> and <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/stagings">Staging projects</a> there.</p>
<p>We are having a lot of fun, and we encourage you to join us!</p>

You can also compile <a href="http://debian.org" title="Debian ">Debian</a>, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" title="Ubuntu linux">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/" title="Arch Linux">Arch</a> and <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/" title="Fedora project">Fedora</a> (and couple more) but why on earth you want to do that? Short answer: because you can! Little bit longer answer: because you can and freedom is two way road. You can&#8217;t guess what Linux distribution or OS your user wants to use but you can make sure that you application is first class citizen in that Linux distribution.<span id="more-10387"></span> Of course You can use Fedora build service or Ubuntu launchpad but they are just for that distribution only. If it&#8217;s fine with you. Be happy and use these marvelous services. If you have woken up in night all sweat. Thinking all these openSUSE lizards that are unhappy because they can&#8217;t use your fabulous application.. it&#8217;s time to start sleeping well.</p>
<h2>Fedora distribution or RHEL</h2>
<p>RPM based Linux distributions are very easy with OBS. You just have to make SPEC file generic. If you like to do it right you should read <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_cross_distribution_howto" title="openSUSE:Build Service cross distribution howto">openSUSE:Build Service cross distribution howto</a> and learn how to do it.</p>
<h2>OBS and DEB based distributions</h2>
<p>This is little bit trickier but not much. You needed decent DSC-file (Most dsc files goes without changes. If you like to use Bzip2 file then you need to add &#8216;DEBTRANSFORM-TAR&#8217; in dsc-file) file and then you need &#8216;debian.tar.gz&#8217; in your project or &#8216;debian/&#8217;-dir in your project. What are files that you need in you debian package/dir? That is a very good question and it stays unanswered here because it&#8217;s not point of this blog. If you are curious enough you can always download &#8216;debian.tar.gz&#8217; from <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:illuusio:example/sdl_displaybitmap" title="OBS Example application">example application</a> and study files or look <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/HowToPackageForDebian" title="HowToPackageForDebian">Debian documentation</a> about it.</p>
<h2>Arch</h2>
<p>Arch is most unknown distribution for me but it has vibrant community and active development so providing packages to them is good thing. They seems to like live bleeding edge. So Just add Arch distribution in your project in OBS and then fill PKGBUILD-file with necessary lines and like magic you have Arch supported (<a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:illuusio:example/sdl_displaybitmap" title="PKGBUILD">Look at example PKGBUILD-file if you don&#8217;t understand a thing</a>).</p>
<p>This was it! No more articles about GCC or around it. Next I&#8217;ve going to dive low level Linux Multimedia especially in audio and FFmpeg (and how you do them in openSUSE). <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/author/illuusio/" title="Blog">if you haven&#8217;t read rest of articles and you feel you missed something</a>. Go on a read them and if you missed good <a href="http://smithfarm-thebrain.blogspot.fi/2013/08/opensuse-packaging-workflow.html" title="OBS client OSC">OSC-blog you can read it too</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was kid Commodore 64 was big thing and I played &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsQsKaMAek" title="Gateway to Apshai youtube">Gateway to Apshai</a>&#8216; hour after hour. It really hit me. Others liked Ultimas but &#8216;Gateway to Apshai&#8217; was THE thing to me. Years after C64 was gone with the wind I found world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29" title="Rogue">Rogue</a>, <a href="http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Omega" title="Omega">Omega</a> and <a href="http://www.nethack.org/" title="Nethack">Nethack</a>. Sweetest of them was Omega. Omega&#8217;s World map was big and you could do what ever you like and wander around and you didn&#8217;t have to fight all the time. As this was a long, long time ago none of those games are no more in active development but Sami Maaranen is still developing unique northern hemisphere survival game called <a href="http://www.unrealworld.fi/" title="UnReal World RPG">UnReal World RPG</a>.<br />
<img src="http://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/17/16794/thumb_300x150/mainscreen318b3.PNG" alt="UnReal World RPG 3.18beta3 start screen" /><img src="http://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/17/16794/thumb_300x150/urw318-restock.png" alt="UnReal World RPG 3.18beta3" /><br />

<span id="more-10329"></span></p>
<h2>UnReal World RPG</h2>
<p>What makes UnReal World RPG so unique? Game is huge, difficult level is infernal and it&#8217;s all about survival in north (Iron-Age Finland actually). As said UnReal World RPG tries to be as quite realistic. You won&#8217;t find goblins nor elves around but UnReal World RPG gives you elks, mooses, bears, wolves, lynxes and really long dark cold winter. If you want to survive the arctic winter you have to try little bit harder (and you probably die). If you like to get into fight you probably die or you get serious wounds and you probably die soon because you can&#8217;t make fire.<br />
Many times this game feels a bit sadistic in modeling how hard it have been in Iron-Age Finland but developer Sami Maaranen (and co-designer Erkka Lehmus) have spent lots of time studying about old ways crafting things, building traps and living off the land in general. As said before learning curve in this game is bit steep but there are plenty of &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK7CXT67arU&amp;list=PLOCBEcNdfIeXVSaKDs97TMKlrdAGr72Pc" title="Let's Play UnReal World RPG">Let&#8217;s play</a>&#8216;-videos floating in Internet to help you out and you can&#8217;t find many games that gives you so much fun. So if you like survival games this is for you.</p>
<h2>This sounds good</h2>
<p>And it is. UnReal World RPG is not Open Source nor it&#8217;s Free Software but it&#8217;s free to play and download (no strings attached). Developer is only asking donations and if you like the game you should really consider to donate small amount to support the development.</p>
<h2>Little bit deeper look</h2>
<p>UnReal World, or shortly UrW, was first released in 1992 as more traditional fantasy roguelike game. Then it evolved and evolved steadily. URW started as MS DOS ascii based game after that was VGA/SVGA DOS upper memory semi graphics version. Third generation took URW to Windows world with SDL-library. At that point notorious rewrite of graphics, sounds and user interface was proceeded, but it was heavily tied to MS Windows world.</p>
<h2>porting UnReal World RPG</h2>
<p>In some point people started to tell in URW <a href="http://z3.invisionfree.com/UrW_forum/index.php?s=165de95ba5c0c30cbe32ddc45915032f&amp;act=idx" title="URW forum">forums</a> that they are playing URW in Wine (both Mac OS X and Linux). They were happy because it worked. Playing in Wine ain&#8217;t pleasant all the time as it&#8217;s with native game.<br />
Porting SDL 1.2 game to another platform is really nice. It only does what it states. You don&#8217;t have to worry about internals and differences between platforms you just figure out differences and make sure everything is working smooth. Although MSVC is very different compiler C than GCC&#8217;s one. There is even huge difference between Mac OS X libc and Linux libc. Even little bit bumpy ride everything went well at the end and version 3.13 was first Linux and Mac OS X native version released.<br />
Developing multiplatfrom has its&#8217; pains but now Linux and Mac OS X are released in same time as Windows version. I used openSUSE system as base Linux system for the port to Linux. Currently there is openSUSE RPM-version (Which is for Fedora also), Ubuntu/Debian DEB-version/Tar-ball and Mac OS X. Statistics show there is steadily growing phase of people coming from those platform to play URW. Only Ubuntu have currently 64-bit version because there is no demand on openSUSE or Fedora (people with Ubuntu just plays more games!).</p>
<h2>Game ON!</h2>
<p>If you don’t have anything else to do on your Christmas vacation: Go and grab <a href="http://www.unrealworld.fi/urw_linuxmirror.html" title="UnReal World RPG Linux download">UnReal World RPG new 3.18beta3</a> version when it&#8217;s hot hot hot. Find yourself building a cottage and swimming in lake or try to survive the arctic winter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YaST switched to the GPL license back in 2004, but there were still a lot of obstacles to easy contributions to the project. There was a bunch of changes in the past to improve contribution to the project, like switching from the openSUSE subversion server to <a href="http://github.com/yast" title="GitHub">GitHub</a>, generating documentation to doc.opensuse.org or having public IRC. But we are not satisfied and do even more steps to make it easy to contribute to YaST.<br />
<span id="more-10277"></span><br /> The most visible action in the last year was the conversion from YCP to Ruby. We found that having a special language just for YaST made some sense in the past, but now becomes useless and makes obstacles for newcomers which must at first learn a language before they can change anything. Ruby is a well known language with a nice ecosystem around including benchmarking, profiling, debugging or testing frameworks. The latest mentioned testing framework is quite important, because good test coverage allows reducing of fear from changes. For tests we chose the well known framework <a href="http://rspec.info/" target="_blank">RSpec</a>, so people coming from the Ruby world know it and others find it intuitive.</p>
<p>Related to tests are also continuous integration that tests code after each code change and automatically sends new packages to the devel project and to Factory if needed. We make our CI node publicly visible on the <a href="http://ci.opensuse.org/view/Yast" title="openSUSE CI server" target="_blank">openSUSE CI server</a>, so everyone can see if build succeeded and what is the reason if it failed.</p>
<p>We also decided to help newcomers with a quick introductory <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:YaST_development" title="documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a>. One page recently updated to reflect the current state is about <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:YaST:_Code_Organization" target="_blank">code organization</a> which helps newcomers to orient in current YaST modules. The content is a bit terse and a minority of pages links to some old tutorials and documentation, but we take care to quickly react to questions and suggestions.
</p>
<p>Another change is deletion of the internal YaST IRC channel and now all communication happens on the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23yast" target="_blank">#yast</a> Freenode channel. This change really increases the chance that you catch YaST developers on IRC. Others ways are the <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/" target="_blank">YaST mailing list</a>, <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Report_a_YaST_bug" target="_blank">Bugzilla</a>, <a href="https://github.com/organizations/yast" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://features.opensuse.org/" target="_blank">openSUSE feature tracker</a>.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s start hacking YaST and if you find any obstacle, contact us, so we can remove it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems this it&#8217;s already 8 of this 10 part series of using GCC with openSUSE. This time topic is: RPM. RPM started as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager" title="Rpm Package Manager">Redhat Package Manager</a> and then it involved to RPM package manager (self explaining acronym like GNU). RPM packages are just files containing all the needed stuff to install application, font or something else in to openSUSE system.<span id="more-10208"></span><br />
RPM is currently wide adopted in Linux distributions openSUSE, embedded Yocto, Fedora and Madriva for name few. Although Yocto can use Debian packages also as base. I have been using an <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/22/opensuse-and-gcc-part-3/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 3: RPM devel packages">example</a> program to <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/28/opensuse-and-gcc-part4/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 4: Pkg-config and what one can do with it">show how to develop</a> very easy application with openSUSE and GCC. Currently <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/11/19/opensuse-and-gcc-part-7/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 7: autotools and how I do it">it uses Autotools tools</a>. Take my advise your application is not worth of anything if you can&#8217;t delivery it to users. Most of the applications (especially closed source) under Linux are distributed as tar-ball format. RPM is not about having Windows style setup it&#8217;s about knowing what is installed in you system.</p>
<h2>RPM agnostics</h2>
<p>There is actually two kinds of RPMs. Binary RPM and then there is Source RPM. Source RPM contains everything needed to compile this package again. Source rpm ending is &#8216;.src.rpm&#8217; or &#8216;nosrc.rpm&#8217;. Binary RPM is architecture specific. So if you have &#8216;arm7v.rpm&#8217; it wont run your x86_64 or x86 machine because it&#8217;s ARM7 binary code. There is also noarch.rpm that is architectural non specific.<br />
In openSUSE traditionally if you build RPM it goes to &#8216;/usr/src/packages&#8217; directory and there is sub directories</p>
<pre>
BUILD/ - Building is done here
SOURCES/ - Contains needed sources for building including patches
SRPMS/ - Where Source RPMS are placed after build
BUILDROOT/ - This is ROOT place where make install places installed files (because you don't want them to go real root dir) 
RPMS/ - All the RPMs are placed here (It contains i686, x86_64 and noarch subdirs where those arch files are placed)
SPECS/ - Where .spec files are placed
</pre>
<p>So if you build i686 RPM with your x86 openSUSE then it would go to &#8216;/usr/src/packages/RPMS/i686&#8242; directory and Source RPM &#8216;/usr/src/packages/SRPMS&#8217; directory.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Now you should <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/11/19/opensuse-and-gcc-part-7/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 7: autotools and how I do it">read Part 7</a> and <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/11/12/opensuse-and-gcc-part-6/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 6: Introduction to autotools">part 6</a> of this series to have example application and autotools installed. then we install rpm-build</p>
<pre>
zypper install rpm-build
</pre>
<p>and make distribution tar-ball of sdl_displaybitmap with</p>
<pre>
make dist
</pre>
<p>there should be  &#8216;sdl_displaybitmap-1.0.tar.bz2&#8242; file now in same directory. then copy this SPEC file to file named &#8216;sdl_displaybitmap.spec&#8217; in same directory you have &#8216;sdl_displaybitmap-1.0.tar.bz2&#8242;</p>
<pre>
Name:           sdl_displaybitmap

%prep
%setup -q

rm -rf $RPM_BUILD_ROOT
# There is nothing to install so we do it with hand

%changelog
</pre>
<p>and copy our tar-ball to &#8216;/usr/src/packages/SOURCES&#8217;. After that we build rpmbuild command to create RPM packages</p>
<pre>
rpmbuild -ba sdl_displaybitmap.spec
</pre>
<p>If everything goes right you should have this RPM in &#8216;/usr/src/packages/RPMS/YOURARCHHERE/sdl_displaybitmap-1.0-1.YOURARCHHERE.rpm&#8217; and SRPM in &#8216;/usr/src/packages/SRPMS/sdl_displaybitmap-1.0-1.src.rpm&#8217;. You can check with less that what files it contains</p>
<pre>
less /usr/src/packages/RPMS/YOURARCHHERE/sdl_displaybitmap-1.0-1.YOURARCHHERE.rpm
</pre>
<p><strong>OBS</strong> If you install this RPM it won&#8217;t work! Application only works if you go to folder &#8216;/usr/share/sdl_displaybitmap&#8217; and run it there. Next time we patch our app to work from other places also.</p>
<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
<p>There is better documentation <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package#Creating_a_SPEC_file" title="Creating a SPEC file">else where than I can write</a>. For openSUSE conventions see <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Packaging" title="Portal:Packaging">Packaging in Wiki</a>. If you curious read it from there and learn. Next time we make OBS (openSUSE Build Service) build from this RPM and last part is how we use OBS to create also Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora packages from our marvelous app.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Welcome to Central Industrial, &#8220;We are the future&#8221;&#8216; is a quote from Blade Runner and now we are entering at last to future with anual <a href="http://www.eu-robotics.net/eurobotics-week/" title="European Robotics Week " target="_blank">European Robotics Week</a>. When Blade Runner world is just around the corner it&#8217;s time to reveal small Robotics pet project with openSUSE and <a href="http://opencv.org/" title="OpenCV">OpenCV</a>.<span id="more-10181"></span></p>
<h2>Starting project</h2>
<p>After reading articles <a href="http://www.einfach-cnc.de/bf20_cnc-umbau.html" title="BF20 CNC-Umbau">like this</a> and <a href="http://www.students.tut.fi/~kontkant/bf20.php.html" title="Optimum BF20 Vario CNC conversion">this</a> I&#8217;ve get idea to turn our mill also to CNC-machine. You can read from those good articles how to make it.They&#8217;ll tell it better than me. If you don&#8217;t read Germany I can let you know neater do I.<br />
I&#8217;ve just took <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno" title="Arduino Uno">Arduino Uno</a> (That was laying around in office), <a href="https://www.synthetos.com/project/grblshield/" title="The Arduino grblShield">grblShield</a> and couple of <a href="http://www.trinamic.com/" title="Trinamic">Trinamic NEMA-17 stepper motor</a> (Not cheapest but they work ok with grblShield). So I was ready to rock.</p>
<h2>Loooooong IDLE</h2>
<p>Then I&#8217;ve take</p>
<pre>
WHILE(1)
  IF HAVE_TIME != YES THEN
    PRINT "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"
    SLEEP MONTH
  ELSE
    PRINT "Hello Doctor Falken, Do you want to play?"
    BREAK
  FI
ELIHW</pre>
<p>Long IDLE and then I  had little spare time so I started project and formulated CNC machine. It&#8217;s not as beautiful as those examples but it works good and it&#8217;s very accurate.</p>
<h2>CNC machine ain&#8217;t robot</h2>
<p>You are correct I just kind of robot. It does what GRBL (G-Code) says but it doesn&#8217;t function by itself. So next when I have more free R&amp;D slots I&#8217;ll take webcam and OpenCV and start converting it to real robot that can function without me.</p>
<h2>But but you didn&#8217;t tell how to get GRBL into Arduino UNO</h2>
<p>Okay I&#8217;ll share this with you and just with you. Download HEX file <a href="https://github.com/grbl/grbl" title="GRBL">from https://github.com/grbl/grbl</a>. Then download Arduino RPMs and avr-dude from <a href="http://build.opensuse.org" title="OBS">http://build.opensuse.org</a>. You got to be on dialout-group in openSUSE to do this (Tune it from YaST2 groups &amp; users position and re-login to it take effect). If you don&#8217;t have any other ACM (probably Modem or GPS device) devices in you machine you device location is probably &#8216;<em>/dev/ttyACM0</em>&#8216; and you also have to know which arduino programming version you have (Mine is <strong>1.0.5</strong>). After that HEX goes in and Arduino blinks light and your robot is alive..</p>
<pre>
avrdude -C/usr/share/arduino-1.0.5/hardware/tools/avrdude.conf -pm328p -carduino -P/your/ACM/device/here -D -U flash:w:your_grbl_hex_here.hex</pre>
<p>Now is time to listen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXa9tXcMhXQ" title="We are the robots">Kraftwerks: We are the robots</a> for few times..</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/11/12/opensuse-and-gcc-part-6/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 6: Introduction to autotools">Last time I was little</a> bit too hard to autotools. Okay they are not easy but they work. I also let last time people to figure how to get a long with autotools. Now I show how I do it.<span id="more-10147"></span></p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s dance</h2>
<p>First put some good music on and relax. Starting new project and trying to get it compile is very unpleasant experience. Then read blog about <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/11/12/opensuse-and-gcc-part-6/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 6: Introduction to autotools">autotools</a> and then also see <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/28/opensuse-and-gcc-part4/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 4: Pkg-config and what one can do with it">example that I&#8217;ve been using</a>. Now you should have files: &#8216;configure.ac&#8217;, &#8216;Makefile.am&#8217;, &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap.c&#8217;, &#8216;LICENSE.TXT&#8217; and &#8216;image.bmp&#8217; in same directory/folder also you should have rpm libSDL_image-devel installed. Then we zypper needed autotools in. </p>
<pre>
zypper install libtool automake autoconf
</pre>
<p>after that we need to make directory contain needed scripts and M4-macros. You don&#8217;t need to copy them manually just make like this in console:</p>
<pre>
aclocal --force
libtoolize -c
automake --copy --add-missing
autoconf --force
</pre>
<p>So we run &#8216;aclocal&#8217; to copy those M4-macros after that we &#8216;libtoolize&#8217; our directory and then &#8216;automake&#8217; creates needed &#8216;Makefile.in&#8217; files from &#8216;Makefile.am&#8217;. Last &#8216;autoconf&#8217; creates configure-script from configure.ac. If everything went fine you ca continue:</p>
<pre>
./configure
make
./SDL_DisplayBitmap
</pre>
<p>Okay now it should work as expected. If you are interested you can try also</p>
<pre>
make dist
</pre>
<p>and you should have &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap-1.0.tar.gz&#8217; and &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap-1.0.tar.bz2&#8242; to distribute you application.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s dig further</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll explain what these sentences mean in &#8216;configure.ac&#8217;:</p>
<pre>
AC_PREREQ([2.57])
AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4])
</pre>
<p>Just tell what Autoconf is needed at least 2.57 and what is M4-macro directory (in this case it&#8217;s &#8216;m4&#8242;)</p>
<pre>
AC_INIT([SDL_DisplayBitmap], [1.0], [http&#058;//lizards.opensuse.org])
</pre>
<p>Let&#8217;s have application named SDL_DisplayBitmap which version is 1.0 and URL to see something more is http&#058;//lizards.opensuse.org</p>
<pre>
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign dist-bzip2])
</pre>
<p>Initialize automake. We want &#8216;tar.bz2&#8242; package also made.</p>
<pre>
AC_LANG_C
AC_PROG_CC
AM_PROG_LIBTOOL
</pre>
<p>Make sure we have C++ and C-compiler and Libtools.</p>
<pre>
C_OPTIONS="-ansi -Wall -Werror -std=c99 -fno-strict-aliasing"
</pre>
<p>I use these C-Flags in my applications. You should use yours.</p>
<pre>
AC_SUBST(C_OPTIONS)
</pre>
<p>Make them available in Makefile.in/.am</p>
<pre>
PKG_CHECK_MODULES(SDL, SDL_image)
</pre>
<p>Check SDL_image from pkg-config and store it in SDL-prefix (SDL_LIBS and SDL_CFLAGS) variable.</p>
<pre>
AC_OUTPUT([Makefile])
</pre>
<p>Configure these files from configure here. In our case only use formulate Makefile.in file. </p>
<h2>Makefile.am</h2>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to listen <em>Scorpions Still loving you</em> if don&#8217;t already listening it.</p>
<pre>
INCLUDES = $(SDL_CFLAGS) $(C_OPTIONS)
</pre>
<p>This actually old school way of doing it but it compatible downwards. We but our C_OPTIONS from configure.ac and SDL needed build flags in build.</p>
<pre>
EXTRA_DIST = LICENSE.TXT image.bmp
</pre>
<p>We also pack these files in distribution tar-ball.</p>
<pre>
noinst_PROGRAMS = SDL_DisplayBitmap
</pre>
<p>This tell we want to have binary named: &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap&#8217; that ain&#8217;t installed anywhere. If you but bin_PROGRAMS application will be installed to &#8216;/usr/local/bin&#8217; or &#8216;prefix/bin&#8217; you mentioned in &#8216;./configure &#8211;prefix=/prefix&#8217; (sbin_PROGRAMS will install it to &#8216;/usr/local/sbin&#8217;).</p>
<pre>
SDL_DisplayBitmap_SOURCES = SDL_DisplayBitmap.c
SDL_DisplayBitmap_LDFLAGS = $(SDL_LIBS)
</pre>
<p>Actually tell what sources belongs to SDL_DisplayBitmap and what libs are need to build this.</p>
<p>Yes that was so easy and nice. Next time is time to make RPM from our example application.</p>
