				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Welcome to Central Industrial, &#8220;We are the future&#8221;&#8216; is a quote from Blade Runner and now we are entering at last to future with anual <a href="http://www.eu-robotics.net/eurobotics-week/" title="European Robotics Week " target="_blank">European Robotics Week</a>. When Blade Runner world is just around the corner it&#8217;s time to reveal small Robotics pet project with openSUSE and <a href="http://opencv.org/" title="OpenCV">OpenCV</a>.<span id="more-10181"></span></p>
<h2>Starting project</h2>
<p>After reading articles <a href="http://www.einfach-cnc.de/bf20_cnc-umbau.html" title="BF20 CNC-Umbau">like this</a> and <a href="http://www.students.tut.fi/~kontkant/bf20.php.html" title="Optimum BF20 Vario CNC conversion">this</a> I&#8217;ve get idea to turn our mill also to CNC-machine. You can read from those good articles how to make it.They&#8217;ll tell it better than me. If you don&#8217;t read Germany I can let you know neater do I.<br />
I&#8217;ve just took <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno" title="Arduino Uno">Arduino Uno</a> (That was laying around in office), <a href="https://www.synthetos.com/project/grblshield/" title="The Arduino grblShield">grblShield</a> and couple of <a href="http://www.trinamic.com/" title="Trinamic">Trinamic NEMA-17 stepper motor</a> (Not cheapest but they work ok with grblShield). So I was ready to rock.</p>
<h2>Loooooong IDLE</h2>
<p>Then I&#8217;ve take</p>
<pre>
WHILE(1)
  IF HAVE_TIME != YES THEN
    PRINT "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"
    SLEEP MONTH
  ELSE
    PRINT "Hello Doctor Falken, Do you want to play?"
    BREAK
  FI
ELIHW</pre>
<p>Long IDLE and then I  had little spare time so I started project and formulated CNC machine. It&#8217;s not as beautiful as those examples but it works good and it&#8217;s very accurate.</p>
<h2>CNC machine ain&#8217;t robot</h2>
<p>You are correct I just kind of robot. It does what GRBL (G-Code) says but it doesn&#8217;t function by itself. So next when I have more free R&amp;D slots I&#8217;ll take webcam and OpenCV and start converting it to real robot that can function without me.</p>
<h2>But but you didn&#8217;t tell how to get GRBL into Arduino UNO</h2>
<p>Okay I&#8217;ll share this with you and just with you. Download HEX file <a href="https://github.com/grbl/grbl" title="GRBL">from https://github.com/grbl/grbl</a>. Then download Arduino RPMs and avr-dude from <a href="http://build.opensuse.org" title="OBS">http://build.opensuse.org</a>. You got to be on dialout-group in openSUSE to do this (Tune it from YaST2 groups &amp; users position and re-login to it take effect). If you don&#8217;t have any other ACM (probably Modem or GPS device) devices in you machine you device location is probably &#8216;<em>/dev/ttyACM0</em>&#8216; and you also have to know which arduino programming version you have (Mine is <strong>1.0.5</strong>). After that HEX goes in and Arduino blinks light and your robot is alive..</p>
<pre>
avrdude -C/usr/share/arduino-1.0.5/hardware/tools/avrdude.conf -pm328p -carduino -P/your/ACM/device/here -D -U flash:w:your_grbl_hex_here.hex</pre>
<p>Now is time to listen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXa9tXcMhXQ" title="We are the robots">Kraftwerks: We are the robots</a> for few times..</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this point of time if you haven&#8217;t any idea what is <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/" title="pkg-config">pkg-config</a> or <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/" title="the GNU Compiler Collection">GCC</a> you should be reading this. Or if you still do please make sure you read about them from these <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/15/opensuse-and-gcc-part-2/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 2: compiling âHello Worldâ">blog</a> <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/28/opensuse-and-gcc-part4/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 4: Pkg-config and what one can do with it">posts</a>. &#8216;<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/" title="GNU Make">Make</a>&#8216; as a tool doesn&#8217;t do anything easier it just hides not-so-easy-part from eyes of public. &#8216;Make&#8217;-tool executes (in default) Makefile-script that should tell how to build your applications step by step. There is no guaranties that it&#8217;s easier to understand how it&#8217;s build or you to understand that after a while.<span id="more-10095"></span></p>
<h2>What should I make then?</h2>
<p>As &#8216;make&#8217; spreads <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29" title="Make (software)">wide area of operating system</a> it&#8217;s not very new tool. You can use make in AIX, HP/UX, BSD variants, Linux, Windows or Solaris. Most of them they got their own make tool that got it&#8217;s own dialect. If you are not using AIX, HP-UX, Solaris or pure nmake from Visual Studio I recommend to learn GNU Make dialect. With that you can easily adapt those others. One can pretend that &#8216;make&#8217; is nearly programming language for building application.<br />
Mostly because &#8216;make&#8217; ain&#8217;t cleanest way building applications there is also other tools as well: <a href="http://scons.org/" title="SCons">Python Scons</a>, <a href="https://ant.apache.org/" title="Apache Ant">Apache Ant</a> and <a href="http://cmake.org/" title="CMake">CMake</a> for example. They all are as powerful as &#8216;make&#8217; if compare them as building tools. You got to remeber Ant is mostly for Java applications but you can use it for anything if you are willing and SCons is general building tool. One can argue all the day and night which of them is the best. One thing is correct &#8216;make&#8217; <em>is not the cleanest</em> but is factory standard.</p>
<h2>First forget everything</h2>
<p>First thing I like to say about make is forget everything you have learned in your life. There is only one way on doing things in &#8216;make&#8217; and it&#8217;s only open for those who are true believers. Now forget those two sentences and you are in correct state of taking example building script as it is. This particular builds <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/28/opensuse-and-gcc-part4/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 4: Pkg-config and what one can do with it">last blogs</a> &#8216;SDL_image&#8217; example program. First we install make</p>
<pre>
zypper install make
</pre>
<p>then make script. Save this in sample directory/Folder as &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap.c&#8217; named &#8216;Makefile&#8217; (In this case capitals are needed). If you use pico/nano make sure intend tabs are tabs not spaces if they are converted make won&#8217;t work.</p>
<pre>
SRC := SDL_DisplayBitmap.c
CFLAGS = $(shell pkg-config --cflags SDL_image)
LIBS = $(shell pkg-config --libs SDL_image)

all: 
	@echo "Building with make is so fun"
	gcc -o SDL_DisplayBitmap $(SRC) $(CFLAGS) $(LIBS)

.PHONY: install clean

clean:
	rm -f SDL_DisplayBitmap

install:
	@echo "This just PHONY install target"
</pre>
<h2>What does it mean?</h2>
<p>Okay let&#8217;s go line by line</p>
<pre>
SRC := SDL_DisplayBitmap.c
</pre>
<p>Variable that contains &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap.c&#8217;. Why it got &#8216;:=&#8217; and no &#8216;=&#8217; that&#8217;s is up to you find out.</p>
<pre>
CFLAGS = $(shell pkg-config --cflags SDL_image)
LIBS = $(shell pkg-config --libs SDL_image)
</pre>
<p>This could be done in one variable but it&#8217;s easier to use in future if it&#8217;s divided in two. Tell to run &#8216;pkg-config&#8217;-tool and pass what ever is output to variable &#8216;CFLAGS&#8217; or &#8216;LIBS&#8217;. So they now have correct building flags and libraries.</p>
<pre>
all: 
&lt;TAB&gt;@echo "Building with make is so fun"
&lt;TAB&gt;gcc -o SDL_DisplayBitmap $(SRC) $(CFLAGS) $(LIBS)
</pre>
<p>Okay this is the main thing of &#8216;all:&#8217;-target. Traditionally there is &#8216;all&#8217;-target in &#8216;Makefile&#8217; to build applications from ground up.<br />
Now be attended! <strong>Always use intending tabs before commands in &#8216;Makefile&#8217; no spaces</strong>. Okay? If &#8216;make&#8217;-tool says you are using spaces to intend convert them to tabs. &#8216;@&#8217;-mark is just don&#8217;t show what we are doing only print what is outputted to stdout and after that we compile using SRC, CFLAGS and LIBS variables. If you are using variable in Makefile it have to be &#8216;$(VARIABLENAME)&#8217; not &#8216;$VARIABLENAME&#8217; or &#8216;VARIABLENAME&#8217;. You can also use lowercase names but again tradition and habits comes in a way.</p>
<pre>
.PHONY: install clean

clean:
&lt;TAB&gt;rm -f SDL_DisplayBitmap

install:
&lt;TAB&gt;@echo "This just PHONY install target"
</pre>
<p>Normally there is clean and install targets available in every &#8216;Makefile&#8217;. It&#8217;s more easier your life stuff than must. I recommend to create them! It will not lead you to hate or suffering. These targets are easy to explain &#8216;clean&#8217;-target should get you source tree in state that if was before building and &#8216;install&#8217;-target should install your binary/binaries. Ahh.. and then there is &#8216;.PHONY&#8217; target is you really are interested <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html" title=".PHONY Docs">read all about it from docs</a>.</p>
<h2>How to make application</h2>
<p>Copy Makefile to folder/directory you have &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap.c&#8217; and run</p>
<pre>
make
</pre>
<p>after that you should have binary &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap&#8217;. if you want to clean your source just run</p>
<pre>
make clean
</pre>
<p>This was just hands dirty example. Make is so much more and more complicated you ever can imagine. Next we jump into Autotools for couple of blogs as they use make as tools to build applications.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I re-booted my blogging habits with very UN-sexy and technical topic &#8216;GNU C Compiler and how to make it with openSUSE&#8217;. I thought nobody bothers to read these because A) Everyone who reads openSUSE blogs are PRO B) everyone wants to do Javascript, Python or &#8216;Put your script language here not C. I can tell actually C ain&#8217;t that bad you just have to shoot yourself to leg and then learn how to walk again.<br />
Last blog entry was about &#8216;<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/22/opensuse-and-gcc-part-3/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 3: RPM devel packages">openSUSE and GCC part 3: RPM devel packages</a>&#8216; someone (thanks for pointing that out really!) noted that I should fix C-Code example I was stunned! There were someone that really readied blog entry. Okay he/she didn&#8217;t say did he/she like it but some one read it.<br />
I have one real reason to this blog-stuff. I hope I have found something like this when I young and I was starting my journey in Linux land. Currently there is so many more people now in populating it and it&#8217;s coming up fast. So If you find errors or don&#8217;t understand something be welcome to ask or want to know about something specific let me know! Now we get on todayâs topic that is &#8216;pkg-config and what one can do with it&#8217;.<span id="more-10083"></span></p>
<h2>Pkg-config makes things easy/complicated (choose one)</h2>
<p>You can live you whole C developer life with Linux and GCC without ever toughing &#8216;<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/" title="pkg-config">pkg-config</a>&#8216;. pkg-config is just something that can make you life easier with C. It&#8217;s not easy to say in couple of words what it does but closest I can get it provides information how to compile application with specific C-library. In other words if you <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/22/opensuse-and-gcc-part-3/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 3: RPM devel packages">read blog before</a> there were these bare &#8216;gcc&#8217; library entries in command-line (-lname stuff).<br />
With more complicated libaries: like GTK+ or SDL you can get yourself wondering what libraries shall I include and what not that I can get my application build. Every self respecting developer wants to keep library dependencies as low as possible. So if you don&#8217;t want to wonder anymore you can use &#8216;pkg-config&#8217;.</p>
<h3>So what it really does?</h3>
<p>Last time I promised SDL_image 1.2 example as it&#8217;s little bit more complicated to get build. Actually it&#8217;s not that complicated but it&#8217;s simple example library and you get nice GUI stuff. First we have to zypper or YaST pkg-config, unzip and SDL_image-devel packages so we can use and link against SDL_image.</p>
<pre>
zypper install pkg-config SDL_image-devel unzip
</pre>
<p>after you have managed to install it you can download this blog example application made by <em>Ryan Clark</em> from here: &#8216;<a href="http://content.gpwiki.org/images/2/2f/SDL_DisplayBitmap.zip" title="SDL_DisplayBitmap.zip">SDL_DisplayBitmap.zip</a>&#8216;. It comes from nice <a href="http://content.gpwiki.org/index.php/SDL" title="SDL ">SDL gaming wiki</a> (<a href="http://content.gpwiki.org/index.php/SDL:Tutorials:Displaying_a_Bitmap" title="Displaying a Bitmap">This tutorial actually</a>) and so if you are interested making games with <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/" title="Simple Direct Layer">SDL 1.2 or 2.0</a> you should pop there. You can download files and unzip it or you can crap same source below and save it as &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap.c&#8217; if you do that remember to have some <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/format/bmp/egff.htm">BMP-image</a> in same directory where you compile named: &#8216;<em>image.bmp</em>&#8216;. Real nerds goes with unzip. If you do it <b>like me</b> it goes like this.</p>
<pre>
unzip SDL_DisplayBitmap.zip
cd SDL_DisplayBitmap
</pre>
<p>Or code for copying</p>

{

	SDL_Flip(screen);
	
	//Wait for 2500ms (2.5 seconds) so we can see the image
	SDL_Delay(2500);
	
	//Release the surface
	SDL_FreeSurface(image);
	
	//Return success!
	return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>I chose this one because it doesn&#8217;t have any compiling aid for poor fellow in ZIP. So we can compile it in openSUSE and most of Linux distros like this:</p>
<pre>
gcc -o SDL_Display Bitmap SDL_DisplayBitmap.c $(pkg-config --libs --cflags SDL_image)
./SDL_Display
</pre>
<p>You should just see nice spaceship for 2.5 seconds nothing more or you own nice BMP-image.</p>
<h2>Do I have to be BASH wizard and what even is BASH?</h2>
<p>If you are reading this in openSUSE you probably use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29" title="BASH">BASH (Bourne Again Shell)</a> and that is all I want to say about that. It&#8217;s not the topic and you can forget all about it. You don&#8217;t have to be wizard of BASH to understand what happens in that sentence above. again we are compiling with &#8216;<em>gcc</em>&#8216; file named &#8216;<em>SDL_DisplayBitmap.c</em>&#8216; to binary &#8216;<em>SDL_DisplayBitmap</em>&#8216;. New stuff starts after that. It just tells to BASH ask from &#8216;pkg-config&#8217; libraries and needed c-flags that comes with SDL_image and attach them here. If you just run you get something like this</p>
<pre>
pkg-config --libs --cflags SDL_image
-D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_REENTRANT -I/usr/include/SDL  -lSDL_image -lSDL -lpthread
</pre>
<p>So compile string is actual then</p>
<pre>
gcc -o SDL_Display Bitmap SDL_DisplayBitmap.c -D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_REENTRANT -I/usr/include/SDL  -lSDL_image -lSDL -lpthread
</pre>
<p>But in every distro tends to tune these cflags stuff and every release of &#8216;SDL_image&#8217; can tune needed libraries. This what you don&#8217;t want to know anything about! You don&#8217;t want to hassle openSUSE&#8217;s or Fedora&#8217;s or Ubuntu&#8217;s global building flags or include neither library locations by hand. You should just go with the automatic &#8216;pkg-config&#8217; way.  If I can give you one bit of advise other than always use suncream for libraries have &#8216;pkg-config&#8217;-config files and use them. Next we get on &#8216;make&#8217; and Makefiles. As I&#8217;m too lazy to copy&#8217;n'paste my &#8216;<em>gcc</em>&#8216; strings here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have these working openSUSE Factory images for the Raspberry Pi, which is an ARM-based mini-computer, and since I want to encourage my kid to do more with computers than playing games (even if they are open-source), I looked into how GPIOs worked.<br />
For that, you need to find the pin allocation &#8211; e.g.<br />
in <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#General_Purpose_Input.2FOutput_.28GPIO.29">the elinux GPIO description</a> or<br />
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1417">http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1417</a><br />
has a video which has it explained at 03:00</p>
<p>For my test, I wired together pin11 and pin12, which are GPIO17 and GPIO18.<br />
I wanted GPIO17 to receive what is sent by GPIO18.<br />
This is how this looked for me: <img src="http://www.zq1.de/~bernhard/images/arm/Raspberry-gpio1718.jpg" alt="foto of GPIO17 and 18 wired together" /></p>
<p>Using it directly from the shell is simple:<br />
<code>echo 17 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export<br />
echo 18 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export<br />
echo out &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio18/direction<br />
echo 1 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio18/value<br />
watch -n 1 head /sys/class/gpio/gpio*/value<br />
</code></p>
<p>If the wiring and configuration was right, the &#8220;watch&#8221; will show gpio17/value to become 1 too.<br />
You can then also pull the wire (or insert a physical switch) and see gpio17/value dropping to 0 again, when it is no more receiving the current from the other pin.</p>
<p>If you managed to get this working, you reached level one of hardware-hackery.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, came across <a title="x2go home" href="http://x2go.org">x2go</a> packages maintained by<a title="People of openSUSE" href="http://news.opensuse.org/2009/04/23/people-of-opensuse-jan-engelhardt/"> Jan Engelhardt</a> for openSUSE and other distributions on <a title="X11:RemoteDesktop:x2go" href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=X11:RemoteDesktop:x2go">open build service</a>. As <a title="Li-f-e" href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">openSUSE Education Li-f-e</a> has great <a title="LTSP home" href="http://ltsp.org">LTSP</a> integration thanks to<a title="KIWI-LTSP on openSUSE wiki" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI-LTSP"> KIWI-LTSP</a>, I decided to check out how x2go can fit in with this existing thin-client computing solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;x2go is an open (<acronym title="GNU General Public License">GPL</acronym>/AGPL) source âserver based computingâ project. Combining the advantages of existing systems it features ease of use, performance and scalability. x2go provides you with access to your desktop &#8211; from within your own network and via the internet. x2go is not limited to particular hardware, it supports a variety of devices and architectures.&#8221; -from their website.</p>
<p>Some of the features/benefits of x2goÂ that are not available on LTSP are:</p>
<p>* Remote login from within local lan and internet from any OS<br />
* Session persistence, you can disconnect session from one client and continue where you left off from any other client<br />
* Low bandwidth usage<br />
* Session sharing with other users<br />
<span id="more-9029"></span><br />
Apart from these, x2go also supports sound redirection via pulseaudio, folder sharing for access to local disks similar to LTSP.</p>
<p>I would personally still prefer LTSP session in local network, and as x2goserver and LTSP server can coexist on same server we can choose x2goclient to connect over the internet and log in using LTSP in local lan.</p>
<p>Here is how to run x2go as kiosk session by PXE booting a thin-client/PC/laptop.</p>
<p>* Install <a title="kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go" href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go">kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go</a> on openSUSE Edu Li-f-e or 12.2 via <a title="Install via 1-click" href="http://software.opensuse.org/ymp/server:ltsp/openSUSE_12.2/kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go.ymp">1-click from here</a>.<br />
* Run <code>kiwi-ltsp -ln openSUSE_12_2_x2go</code> as root to create KIWI-LTSP image that is used for PXE booting clients, (this step requires fast internet connection and about 250M download)<br />
* Run <code>kiwi-ltsp -c</code> to configure required services<br />
* Add the following to<strong><em> /srv/tftpboot/KIWI/root.default/etc/lts.conf</strong></em>  under [default] for all clients or under [MA:CA:DD:RE:SS] for a particular client and boot up the client, openSUSE_12_2_x2go will be available at the end of boot menu.<br />
<code><br />
        SCREEN_07=kiosk<br />
        KIOSK_EXE="/usr/bin/x2goclient --no-menu --maximize --link=lan --geometry=fullscreen --thinclient --haltbt --no-session-edit  --add-to-known-hosts"<br />
        KIOSKUSER=x2goclient<br />
 </code></p>
<p>You can also have normal LTSP session on tty8 along with this by adding <code>SCREEN_08=ldm</code>. To connect to the server from non-thin-client install and run x2goclient.</p>
<p>You can simply poweroff the client without the need to disconnect or do normal shutdown.</p>
<p>Note: this method of using x2go is just for testing and development purpose, you can use x2goserver and x2goclient in a standalone mode without kiwi-ltsp bits. Nothing additional than installing x2goserver package is needed to setup the server, except firewall should allow access to ssh port(22). </p>
