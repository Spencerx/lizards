				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The x86_64 edition of openSUSE Education&#8217;s <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e" title="Li-f-e">Li-f-e</a> live DVD supports PXE booting the iso over the network, here is how to do it:</p>
<p>* Install Li-f-e (Switch to GRUB from Installation Summary page if your hardware does not support EFI boot ), make sure you have plenty of space assigned to / partition(about 20G)<br />
* Set up LTSP by following this <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:LTSP%20quick%20start%2012.2%20Edu" title="LTSP Quick Start">quick start guide</a><br />
* Create /srv/nfs folder and copy Li-f-e iso there<br />
* Run the following as root in terminal:<br />
<code><br />
mount /srv/nfs/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e.x86_64-13.1.1.iso /mnt<br />
cp /mnt/boot/x86_64/loader/linux /srv/tftpboot/boot/linux-life64<br />
cp /mnt/boot/x86_64/loader/initrd /srv/tftpboot/boot/initrd-life64<br />
echo "/srv/nfs *(ro,no_root_squash,async,no_subtree_check)" &gt;&gt; /etc/exports<br />
cat &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt; /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default<br />
LABEL Li-f-e<br />
kernel boot/linux-life64<br />
append initrd=boot/initrd-life64 isofrom_device=nfs:10.0.0.254:/srv/nfs/ isofrom_system=/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e.x86_64-13.1.1.iso nonm<br />
IPAPPEND 2<br />
EOF<br />
chkconfig rpcbind on &amp;&amp; service rpcbind restart<br />
chkconfig nfsserver on &amp;&amp; service nfsserver restart<br />
</code><br />
Now you can PXE boot any machine over the network, select Li-f-e from the end of the boot menu to boot live DVD iso instead of normal LTSP session.</p>
<p>Please note that if you install Li-f-e booted over the network then after the installation  you will need to remove &#8220;nonm&#8221; boot option using yast2 bootloader to get NetworkManager working again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>First warning and please read it: If you wipe your harddisk, USB-stick or Flash with any of these tips. Your data won&#8217;t magically come back! After correct &#8216;secure rm&#8217; or &#8216;NWipe&#8217; there way is no way to bring your valuable data back. Make backups and happy wiping!<br />
</strong><br />
Destroying data permanently from hard disk is not as easy as you think. Sometime hard disks just self destructs without notice but when there is police behind you door knocking and you have destroy as much data as you can it&#8217;s little bit trickier. Even normal cases when there ain&#8217;t police at door and you just want to make sure that your old hard disk is clean and it doesn&#8217;t contain your personal data it&#8217;s a bit of a problem.<span id="more-10448"></span><br />
Removing with GUIs delete most times just sends files to Trash bin where they can be read normally. Same goes with deleting them permanently. It just tells to filesystem this part of hard disk is up for usage again. It takes many writes in that part of hard disk before it&#8217;s safe to say you can&#8217;t recover any of old data. So if you just accidentally deleted file and popped up here there is still hope but I won&#8217;t tell how to bring it back.<br />
One method for remove files permanently is use <a href="http://srm.sourceforge.net/" title="Secure rm">secure rm</a> (srm for short). It&#8217;s not fastest way to remove files but after running srm no-one can read your file again and like I say on topic <em>there is no way to bring file back!</em>. Secure rm is nice but it doesn&#8217;t wipe your hard disk entirely.</p>
<h2>DBAN</h2>
<p>If you needed hard disk wiping &#8216;<a href="http://www.dban.org/" title="DBAN">Darik&#8217;s Boot And Nuke</a> A.K.A DBAN&#8217; is tool for you. Currently it&#8217;s obtained by Finnish firm that uses same stuff <a href="http://www.blancco.com/en/home/" title="Blancco">so if you are need of professional supported stuff go and ask them</a>. If you are just need for tool for wiping hard disk data go, download and burn latest DBAN image. it&#8217;s easy to use and it will destroy data. Again data is gone after DBAN has runned with default configs so really make backups! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9jfLDrm2Q0" title="Learn to use DBAN">This is video how to make it with DBAN.</a> If you not pro watch it fully before making any moves.</p>
<h2>I don&#8217;t want to burn anything to CDR</h2>
<p>Okay you are in that mood. Many of new laptop doesn&#8217;t contain CD-drive anymore so what to do. Here is my tip for you. <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Live_USB_stick" title="openSUSE USB Stick">Create bootable USB stick</a> (read whole thing before doing anything). After you have managed to boot your new shiny openSUSE USB-stick install <a href="http://www.andybev.com/index.php/Nwipe" title="NWipe">NWipe</a>. NWipe is fork of DBAN DWipe that does actual wiping that is ported to work without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file" title="What are devices and DevFS">devfs</a> (which is obsolette anyways). Install it <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/illuusio/" title="NWipe rpm">from here</a> with zypper (something like </p>
<pre>
zypper install <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/illuusio/openSUSE_13.1/x86_64/nwipe-0.14-3.1.x86_64.rpm" title="Link to rpm">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/illuusio/openSUSE_13.1/x86_64/nwipe-0.14-3.1.x86_64.rpm</a>
</pre>
<p>) after that run &#8216;nwipe&#8217; application and make sure that you won&#8217;t clean your USB stick.<br />
After you have chose your partitions and way you want it to be done (I use American army stuff in for wiping but does NSA have some backdoor in those? I don&#8217;t know..) go a head and make your hard disk and processor suffer. <strong>Again once more bit FAT WARNING. If you want to make small joke for your dad or cause anyone hard attack just destroy hard disk for fun there ain&#8217;t coming back (hope you have backups!).</strong> Your partition table is gone same goes with filesystem. No more seeking files with hex editor or dedicated applications. Your files are just random bytes in hard disk.<br />
and like openSUSE slogan is have a lots of fun when you wipe your disks!</p>

<h2>Starting project</h2>
<p>After reading articles <a href="http://www.einfach-cnc.de/bf20_cnc-umbau.html" title="BF20 CNC-Umbau">like this</a> and <a href="http://www.students.tut.fi/~kontkant/bf20.php.html" title="Optimum BF20 Vario CNC conversion">this</a> I&#8217;ve get idea to turn our mill also to CNC-machine. You can read from those good articles how to make it.They&#8217;ll tell it better than me. If you don&#8217;t read Germany I can let you know neater do I.<br />
I&#8217;ve just took <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno" title="Arduino Uno">Arduino Uno</a> (That was laying around in office), <a href="https://www.synthetos.com/project/grblshield/" title="The Arduino grblShield">grblShield</a> and couple of <a href="http://www.trinamic.com/" title="Trinamic">Trinamic NEMA-17 stepper motor</a> (Not cheapest but they work ok with grblShield). So I was ready to rock.</p>
<h2>Loooooong IDLE</h2>
<p>Then I&#8217;ve take</p>
<pre>
WHILE(1)
  IF HAVE_TIME != YES THEN
    PRINT "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"
    SLEEP MONTH
  ELSE
    PRINT "Hello Doctor Falken, Do you want to play?"
    BREAK
  FI
ELIHW</pre>
<p>Long IDLE and then I  had little spare time so I started project and formulated CNC machine. It&#8217;s not as beautiful as those examples but it works good and it&#8217;s very accurate.</p>
<h2>CNC machine ain&#8217;t robot</h2>
<p>You are correct I just kind of robot. It does what GRBL (G-Code) says but it doesn&#8217;t function by itself. So next when I have more free R&amp;D slots I&#8217;ll take webcam and OpenCV and start converting it to real robot that can function without me.</p>
<h2>But but you didn&#8217;t tell how to get GRBL into Arduino UNO</h2>
<p>Okay I&#8217;ll share this with you and just with you. Download HEX file <a href="https://github.com/grbl/grbl" title="GRBL">from https://github.com/grbl/grbl</a>. Then download Arduino RPMs and avr-dude from <a href="http://build.opensuse.org" title="OBS">http://build.opensuse.org</a>. You got to be on dialout-group in openSUSE to do this (Tune it from YaST2 groups &amp; users position and re-login to it take effect). If you don&#8217;t have any other ACM (probably Modem or GPS device) devices in you machine you device location is probably &#8216;<em>/dev/ttyACM0</em>&#8216; and you also have to know which arduino programming version you have (Mine is <strong>1.0.5</strong>). After that HEX goes in and Arduino blinks light and your robot is alive..</p>
<pre>
avrdude -C/usr/share/arduino-1.0.5/hardware/tools/avrdude.conf -pm328p -carduino -P/your/ACM/device/here -D -U flash:w:your_grbl_hex_here.hex</pre>
<p>Now is time to listen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXa9tXcMhXQ" title="We are the robots">Kraftwerks: We are the robots</a> for few times..</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this point of time if you haven&#8217;t any idea what is <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/" title="pkg-config">pkg-config</a> or <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/" title="the GNU Compiler Collection">GCC</a> you should be reading this. Or if you still do please make sure you read about them from these <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/15/opensuse-and-gcc-part-2/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 2: compiling ‘Hello World’">blog</a> <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/28/opensuse-and-gcc-part4/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 4: Pkg-config and what one can do with it">posts</a>. &#8216;<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/" title="GNU Make">Make</a>&#8216; as a tool doesn&#8217;t do anything easier it just hides not-so-easy-part from eyes of public. &#8216;Make&#8217;-tool executes (in default) Makefile-script that should tell how to build your applications step by step. There is no guaranties that it&#8217;s easier to understand how it&#8217;s build or you to understand that after a while.<span id="more-10095"></span></p>
<h2>What should I make then?</h2>
<p>As &#8216;make&#8217; spreads <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29" title="Make (software)">wide area of operating system</a> it&#8217;s not very new tool. You can use make in AIX, HP/UX, BSD variants, Linux, Windows or Solaris. Most of them they got their own make tool that got it&#8217;s own dialect. If you are not using AIX, HP-UX, Solaris or pure nmake from Visual Studio I recommend to learn GNU Make dialect. With that you can easily adapt those others. One can pretend that &#8216;make&#8217; is nearly programming language for building application.<br />
Mostly because &#8216;make&#8217; ain&#8217;t cleanest way building applications there is also other tools as well: <a href="http://scons.org/" title="SCons">Python Scons</a>, <a href="https://ant.apache.org/" title="Apache Ant">Apache Ant</a> and <a href="http://cmake.org/" title="CMake">CMake</a> for example. They all are as powerful as &#8216;make&#8217; if compare them as building tools. You got to remeber Ant is mostly for Java applications but you can use it for anything if you are willing and SCons is general building tool. One can argue all the day and night which of them is the best. One thing is correct &#8216;make&#8217; <em>is not the cleanest</em> but is factory standard.</p>
<h2>First forget everything</h2>
<p>First thing I like to say about make is forget everything you have learned in your life. There is only one way on doing things in &#8216;make&#8217; and it&#8217;s only open for those who are true believers. Now forget those two sentences and you are in correct state of taking example building script as it is. This particular builds <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/28/opensuse-and-gcc-part4/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 4: Pkg-config and what one can do with it">last blogs</a> &#8216;SDL_image&#8217; example program. First we install make</p>
<pre>
zypper install make
</pre>
<p>then make script. Save this in sample directory/Folder as &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap.c&#8217; named &#8216;Makefile&#8217; (In this case capitals are needed). If you use pico/nano make sure intend tabs are tabs not spaces if they are converted make won&#8217;t work.</p>
<pre>
SRC := SDL_DisplayBitmap.c
CFLAGS = $(shell pkg-config --cflags SDL_image)
LIBS = $(shell pkg-config --libs SDL_image)

all: 
	@echo "Building with make is so fun"
	gcc -o SDL_DisplayBitmap $(SRC) $(CFLAGS) $(LIBS)

.PHONY: install clean

clean:
	rm -f SDL_DisplayBitmap

install:
	@echo "This just PHONY install target"
</pre>
<h2>What does it mean?</h2>
<p>Okay let&#8217;s go line by line</p>
<pre>
SRC := SDL_DisplayBitmap.c
</pre>
<p>Variable that contains &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap.c&#8217;. Why it got &#8216;:=&#8217; and no &#8216;=&#8217; that&#8217;s is up to you find out.</p>
<pre>
CFLAGS = $(shell pkg-config --cflags SDL_image)
LIBS = $(shell pkg-config --libs SDL_image)
</pre>
<p>This could be done in one variable but it&#8217;s easier to use in future if it&#8217;s divided in two. Tell to run &#8216;pkg-config&#8217;-tool and pass what ever is output to variable &#8216;CFLAGS&#8217; or &#8216;LIBS&#8217;. So they now have correct building flags and libraries.</p>
<pre>
all: 
&lt;TAB&gt;@echo "Building with make is so fun"
&lt;TAB&gt;gcc -o SDL_DisplayBitmap $(SRC) $(CFLAGS) $(LIBS)
</pre>
<p>Okay this is the main thing of &#8216;all:&#8217;-target. Traditionally there is &#8216;all&#8217;-target in &#8216;Makefile&#8217; to build applications from ground up.<br />
Now be attended! <strong>Always use intending tabs before commands in &#8216;Makefile&#8217; no spaces</strong>. Okay? If &#8216;make&#8217;-tool says you are using spaces to intend convert them to tabs. &#8216;@&#8217;-mark is just don&#8217;t show what we are doing only print what is outputted to stdout and after that we compile using SRC, CFLAGS and LIBS variables. If you are using variable in Makefile it have to be &#8216;$(VARIABLENAME)&#8217; not &#8216;$VARIABLENAME&#8217; or &#8216;VARIABLENAME&#8217;. You can also use lowercase names but again tradition and habits comes in a way.</p>
<pre>
.PHONY: install clean

clean:
&lt;TAB&gt;rm -f SDL_DisplayBitmap

install:
&lt;TAB&gt;@echo "This just PHONY install target"
</pre>
<p>Normally there is clean and install targets available in every &#8216;Makefile&#8217;. It&#8217;s more easier your life stuff than must. I recommend to create them! It will not lead you to hate or suffering. These targets are easy to explain &#8216;clean&#8217;-target should get you source tree in state that if was before building and &#8216;install&#8217;-target should install your binary/binaries. Ahh.. and then there is &#8216;.PHONY&#8217; target is you really are interested <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html" title=".PHONY Docs">read all about it from docs</a>.</p>
<h2>How to make application</h2>
<p>Copy Makefile to folder/directory you have &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap.c&#8217; and run</p>
<pre>
make
</pre>
<p>after that you should have binary &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap&#8217;. if you want to clean your source just run</p>
<pre>
make clean
</pre>
<p>This was just hands dirty example. Make is so much more and more complicated you ever can imagine. Next we jump into Autotools for couple of blogs as they use make as tools to build applications.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I re-booted my blogging habits with very UN-sexy and technical topic &#8216;GNU C Compiler and how to make it with openSUSE&#8217;. I thought nobody bothers to read these because A) Everyone who reads openSUSE blogs are PRO B) everyone wants to do Javascript, Python or &#8216;Put your script language here not C. I can tell actually C ain&#8217;t that bad you just have to shoot yourself to leg and then learn how to walk again.<br />
Last blog entry was about &#8216;<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/22/opensuse-and-gcc-part-3/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 3: RPM devel packages">openSUSE and GCC part 3: RPM devel packages</a>&#8216; someone (thanks for pointing that out really!) noted that I should fix C-Code example I was stunned! There were someone that really readied blog entry. Okay he/she didn&#8217;t say did he/she like it but some one read it.<br />
I have one real reason to this blog-stuff. I hope I have found something like this when I young and I was starting my journey in Linux land. Currently there is so many more people now in populating it and it&#8217;s coming up fast. So If you find errors or don&#8217;t understand something be welcome to ask or want to know about something specific let me know! Now we get on today’s topic that is &#8216;pkg-config and what one can do with it&#8217;.<span id="more-10083"></span></p>
<h2>Pkg-config makes things easy/complicated (choose one)</h2>
<p>You can live you whole C developer life with Linux and GCC without ever toughing &#8216;<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/" title="pkg-config">pkg-config</a>&#8216;. pkg-config is just something that can make you life easier with C. It&#8217;s not easy to say in couple of words what it does but closest I can get it provides information how to compile application with specific C-library. In other words if you <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/22/opensuse-and-gcc-part-3/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 3: RPM devel packages">read blog before</a> there were these bare &#8216;gcc&#8217; library entries in command-line (-lname stuff).<br />
With more complicated libaries: like GTK+ or SDL you can get yourself wondering what libraries shall I include and what not that I can get my application build. Every self respecting developer wants to keep library dependencies as low as possible. So if you don&#8217;t want to wonder anymore you can use &#8216;pkg-config&#8217;.</p>
<h3>So what it really does?</h3>
<p>Last time I promised SDL_image 1.2 example as it&#8217;s little bit more complicated to get build. Actually it&#8217;s not that complicated but it&#8217;s simple example library and you get nice GUI stuff. First we have to zypper or YaST pkg-config, unzip and SDL_image-devel packages so we can use and link against SDL_image.</p>
<pre>
zypper install pkg-config SDL_image-devel unzip
</pre>
<p>after you have managed to install it you can download this blog example application made by <em>Ryan Clark</em> from here: &#8216;<a href="http://content.gpwiki.org/images/2/2f/SDL_DisplayBitmap.zip" title="SDL_DisplayBitmap.zip">SDL_DisplayBitmap.zip</a>&#8216;. It comes from nice <a href="http://content.gpwiki.org/index.php/SDL" title="SDL ">SDL gaming wiki</a> (<a href="http://content.gpwiki.org/index.php/SDL:Tutorials:Displaying_a_Bitmap" title="Displaying a Bitmap">This tutorial actually</a>) and so if you are interested making games with <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/" title="Simple Direct Layer">SDL 1.2 or 2.0</a> you should pop there. You can download files and unzip it or you can crap same source below and save it as &#8216;SDL_DisplayBitmap.c&#8217; if you do that remember to have some <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/format/bmp/egff.htm">BMP-image</a> in same directory where you compile named: &#8216;<em>image.bmp</em>&#8216;. Real nerds goes with unzip. If you do it <b>like me</b> it goes like this.</p>
<pre>
unzip SDL_DisplayBitmap.zip
cd SDL_DisplayBitmap
</pre>
<p>Or code for copying</p>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	SDL_Surface *screen;	//This pointer will reference the backbuffer
	SDL_Surface *image;	//This pointer will reference our bitmap sprite

		printf("Unable to initialize SDL: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
		return 1;
	}

	atexit(SDL_Quit);

	temp = SDL_LoadBMP("image.bmp");
	if (temp == NULL) {
		printf("Unable to load bitmap: %s\n", SDL_GetError());
		return 1;
	}
	
	//Convert the surface to the appropriate display format
	image = SDL_DisplayFormat(temp);
	
	//Release the temporary surface
	SDL_FreeSurface(temp);
	
	//Construct the source rectangle for our blit
	src.x = 0;
	src.y = 0;
	src.w = image-&gt;w;	//Use image-&gt;w to display the entire width of the image
	src.h = image-&gt;h;	//Use image-&gt;h to display the entire height of the image
	
	//Construct the destination rectangle for our blit
	dest.x = 100;		//Display the image at the (X,Y) coordinates (100,100)
	dest.y = 100;
	dest.w = image-&gt;w;	//Ensure the destination is large enough for the image's entire width/height
	dest.h = image-&gt;h;
	
	//Blit the image to the backbuffer
	SDL_BlitSurface(image, &amp;src, screen, &amp;dest);
	
	//Flip the backbuffer to the primary
	SDL_Flip(screen);
	
	//Wait for 2500ms (2.5 seconds) so we can see the image
	SDL_Delay(2500);
	
	//Release the surface
	SDL_FreeSurface(image);
	
	//Return success!
	return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>I chose this one because it doesn&#8217;t have any compiling aid for poor fellow in ZIP. So we can compile it in openSUSE and most of Linux distros like this:</p>
<pre>
gcc -o SDL_Display Bitmap SDL_DisplayBitmap.c $(pkg-config --libs --cflags SDL_image)
./SDL_Display
</pre>
<p>You should just see nice spaceship for 2.5 seconds nothing more or you own nice BMP-image.</p>
<h2>Do I have to be BASH wizard and what even is BASH?</h2>
<p>If you are reading this in openSUSE you probably use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29" title="BASH">BASH (Bourne Again Shell)</a> and that is all I want to say about that. It&#8217;s not the topic and you can forget all about it. You don&#8217;t have to be wizard of BASH to understand what happens in that sentence above. again we are compiling with &#8216;<em>gcc</em>&#8216; file named &#8216;<em>SDL_DisplayBitmap.c</em>&#8216; to binary &#8216;<em>SDL_DisplayBitmap</em>&#8216;. New stuff starts after that. It just tells to BASH ask from &#8216;pkg-config&#8217; libraries and needed c-flags that comes with SDL_image and attach them here. If you just run you get something like this</p>
<pre>
pkg-config --libs --cflags SDL_image
-D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_REENTRANT -I/usr/include/SDL  -lSDL_image -lSDL -lpthread
</pre>
<p>So compile string is actual then</p>
<pre>
gcc -o SDL_Display Bitmap SDL_DisplayBitmap.c -D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_REENTRANT -I/usr/include/SDL  -lSDL_image -lSDL -lpthread
</pre>
<p>But in every distro tends to tune these cflags stuff and every release of &#8216;SDL_image&#8217; can tune needed libraries. This what you don&#8217;t want to know anything about! You don&#8217;t want to hassle openSUSE&#8217;s or Fedora&#8217;s or Ubuntu&#8217;s global building flags or include neither library locations by hand. You should just go with the automatic &#8216;pkg-config&#8217; way.  If I can give you one bit of advise other than always use suncream for libraries have &#8216;pkg-config&#8217;-config files and use them. Next we get on &#8216;make&#8217; and Makefiles. As I&#8217;m too lazy to copy&#8217;n'paste my &#8216;<em>gcc</em>&#8216; strings here.</p>

<p>Get it from here:<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/opensuse-edu/files/latest/download?source=files">Direct Download</a> | <a href="http://www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e-12.3-latest-i686.iso.torrent">Torrents</a> | <a href="http://www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e-12.3-1-i686.iso.meta4">Metalinks</a> | <a href="http://www.opensuse-education.org/download/ISOs/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e-12.3-latest-i686.iso.md5">md5sum</a></p>
<p>As this edition is based on openSUSE 12.3, all the official 12.3 updates, repositories from build service and <a href="http://packman.links2linux.org/">Packman</a> can be used to install additional softwares and keep it up to date.</p>
<p>Minimum hardware requirement is 1GB of RAM and 15GB free disk space. Installation from USB stick will take about 40 minutes to complete, from a DVD it takes much longer. Check <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2012/09/13/live-fat-stick/">this howto</a> for creating live USB stick on vfat partition or other <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick">GUI and terminal ways</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the sampling of some of the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">softwares available on the iso</a>. Complete list of packages with versions <a href="http://www.opensuse-education.org/%7Ecyberorg/opensuse-edu-life-1231-packages.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>This time, we also have an <a href="http://susestudio.com/search?q=opensuse-edu">openSUSE Edu Li-f-e 12.3 64bit</a> version in <a href="http://susestudio.com/">SUSE Studio</a> – if you want to give it a try, just download the ISO image or log in and run the image via “Testdrive” in your local browser! (Please note that 64bit edition has not gone through rigorous QA.)</p>
<p>Test reports are always welcome – if you encounter any problems, feel free to contact us via any way mentioned in our <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Education">wiki</a> or write a <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=7340&amp;product=openSUSE.org&amp;component=3rd%20party%20software&amp;assigned_to=lrupp%40suse.com&amp;short_desc=Education">bugreport</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have these working openSUSE Factory images for the Raspberry Pi, which is an ARM-based mini-computer, and since I want to encourage my kid to do more with computers than playing games (even if they are open-source), I looked into how GPIOs worked.<br />
For that, you need to find the pin allocation &#8211; e.g.<br />
in <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#General_Purpose_Input.2FOutput_.28GPIO.29">the elinux GPIO description</a> or<br />
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1417">http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1417</a><br />
has a video which has it explained at 03:00</p>
<p>For my test, I wired together pin11 and pin12, which are GPIO17 and GPIO18.<br />
I wanted GPIO17 to receive what is sent by GPIO18.<br />
This is how this looked for me: <img src="http://www.zq1.de/~bernhard/images/arm/Raspberry-gpio1718.jpg" alt="foto of GPIO17 and 18 wired together" /></p>
<p>Using it directly from the shell is simple:<br />
<code>echo 17 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export<br />
echo 18 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export<br />
echo out &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio18/direction<br />
echo 1 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio18/value<br />
watch -n 1 head /sys/class/gpio/gpio*/value<br />
</code></p>
<p>If the wiring and configuration was right, the &#8220;watch&#8221; will show gpio17/value to become 1 too.<br />
You can then also pull the wire (or insert a physical switch) and see gpio17/value dropping to 0 again, when it is no more receiving the current from the other pin.</p>
<p>If you managed to get this working, you reached level one of hardware-hackery.</p>
