				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this post, there how to watch 360 videos on the Linux platform without the need for special technical magic. To do this, just use the package QMPlay 2, A player based on QT that fulfills its function very well. In addition to being versatile and effective, bringing an incredible amount of features for you to use, including touchscreen monitor recognition to navigate the video preview.</p>

<p>To watch 360 video, first press PLAYBACK the main menu, then choose VIDEO FILTERS, and finally enable the SPHERICAL VIEW option to use the 360 viewing function.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was searching to add some awesome icons to GNOME. After a long search, I found out that <a href="http://vamox.blogspot.gr/" target="1">VAMOX</a> icons rock!!! I liked the 3D nature of them. They come to 3 different versions. Take a look:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Vamox+MATE+%28green%29?content=166332" target="1">Vamox MATE</a><br />
2. <a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/vamox+ceibo+%28red%29?content=166486" target="1">Vamox Ceibo</a><br />
3. <a href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Vamox+Celeste+%28light-blue%29?content=95244" target="1">Vamox Celeste</a></p>
<p>I thought why not try to put them to <a href="https://build.opensuse.org" target="_blank">obs</a>? Is it the right tool? I made a research and found some other cool icons there. So I started reading and testing. A lot of errors. Since I&#8217;m end user, I thought I&#8217;m not going to make it. I better quit. So I deleted everything. The next day, I tried 2-3 times and it worked (the actual error was the name of the unzipped file). I tried it on my computer and it worked fine. Then I added Fedora as another repository and with the help of my friend <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/user/show/thanos" target="_blank">Tom Tryfonidis</a>, I added Arch Linux. Let&#8217;s see the result.</p>
<p><b>VAMOX MATE</b></p>
<p><a href="http://paste.opensuse.org/images/20423431.jpg"><img src="http://paste.opensuse.org/images/20423431.jpg" alt="" width="80%" height="80%&quot;" /></a></p>
<p>If you like this result, go to <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Adiamond_gr&amp;package=vamox-mate" target="1">vamox mate repository</a> and choose your distro.</p>
<p><b>VAMOX Ceibo</b></p>
<p><a href="http://paste.opensuse.org/images/81245200.jpg"><img src="http://paste.opensuse.org/images/81245200.jpg" alt="" width="80%" height="80%&quot;" /></a></p>
<p>If you like this result, go to <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Adiamond_gr&amp;package=vamox-ceibo" target="1">vamox ceibo repository</a> and choose your distro.</p>
<p><b>VAMOX Celeste</b></p>
<p><a href="http://paste.opensuse.org/images/39169921.jpg"><img src="http://paste.opensuse.org/images/39169921.jpg" alt="" width="80%" height="80%&quot;" /></a></p>
<p>If you like this result, go to <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Adiamond_gr&amp;package=vamox-celeste" target="1">vamox celeste repository</a> and choose your distro.</p>
<p>NOTE: It&#8217;s tested on openSUSE (GNOME, XFCE and MATE) and on Arch (GNOME)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Fosdem 2014</h2>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12271807465_4eb0674948_b.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12271807465_4eb0674948_b-150x150.jpg" alt="fosdem 2014 - full" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10496" style="margin:8px" /></a></p>
<p>Again this year, <a href="https://fosdem.org/">Fosdem</a> was really delightful, a bit crowdy as hell concerning a number of conference rooms.</p>
<p>But if there&#8217;s a constant, it is the awesomeness of the Fosdem staff and its armada of volunteers. Please all of you who made this event so great, receive in the name of openSUSE&#8217;s community our warmest thanks and congratulations.</p>
<p>I will not make a mistake if I predict a big success for the different talk&#8217;s videos, in the next following weeks.</p>
<h2 style="clear:both">openSUSE merchandising new collection</h2>
<p>After a <b>loooong wait</b>, perceived as a century, openSUSE Booth was furbished with the next generation of merchandising stuff.<br />
<br />At least some part of the complete kit, which should be available in April.</p>
<p><span id="more-10494"></span></p>
<h3>The new design &amp; branding ideas</h3>
<p>This was the first public showing of the new posters &amp; goodies design. The basis of the design appear first during HackWeek&#8217;10<br />
<img src="https://hackweek.suse.com/assets/hackweek-logo-10-2dbf37934f48409e969e0339f472bab4.png" style="background:#c4c4c4;margin: 10px;padding: 10px;width:50%;height:50%" /><br />
<br />this Geeko&#8217;s was put on pullover <i>I&#8217;m still looking where I can grab one, so take care of yours if you own one <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></i></p>
<h3>Posters</h3>
<p>We got three kind of new posters, and one block-note. I would like to thanks booth&#8217;s helpers for spreading them on almost any Fosdem&#8217;s building free walls.</p>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-discover-it.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-discover-it-213x300.jpg" alt="2014-discover-it" width="213" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10499" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-discover-it-213x300.jpg 213w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-discover-it.jpg 344w" sizes="(max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px" /></a></p>
<h4>Discover it &#8211; Bulb A2</h4>
<p>With elegant dark green and white symbol on big format, it won the heart’s public.<br />
Several of them were offered.
</p>
</div>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em;clear:both"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-block-note.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-block-note-198x300.jpg" alt="2014-A3-block-note" width="198" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10497" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-block-note-198x300.jpg 198w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-block-note.jpg 341w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /></a></p>
<h4>Block-note meeting or communication papers A3</h4>
<p>
Useful on a booth to pick feedback, announce something in an fashionned way.<br />
I hope we will have the A4 format too.
</p>
</div>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em;clear:both">
<h4>Linux for open minds A3</h4>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-linux-for-openminds.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-linux-for-openminds-209x300.jpg" alt="2014-linux-for-openminds" width="209" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10500" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-linux-for-openminds-209x300.jpg 209w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-linux-for-openminds.jpg 338w" sizes="(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px" /></a></p>
<p>With its light green and zen symbols I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the perfect poster in an office, being not too intrusive.<br />
<br />It found its place on walls around the Fosdem, but on the booth A3 format reduce its attractive effect.<br />
The second default (if it&#8217;s one) project name and logo are small, bottom placed so could escape visitor attention.
</p>
</div>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em;clear:both">
<h4>We believe &#8211; cube way A3</h4>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-we_believe.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-we_believe-200x300.jpg" alt="2014-A3-we_believe" width="200" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10498" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-we_believe-200x300.jpg 200w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-we_believe.jpg 337w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></p>
<p>The &quot;we believe&quot; collection was always my favorite one. But I must admit the format proposed doesn&#8217;t work on booth. It lacks contrast and/or appealing colors.<br />
If you stand at more than 1.5 meters the message (our guidelines) are almost unreadable.<br />
<br />Look like this one need another development iteration.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em;clear:both">
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth-300x225.jpg" alt="fosdem-2014-booth" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10502" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h5>Stickers</h5>
<h6>Geeko&#8217;s stickers</h6>
<p>Appreciated and adopted by fans, and the public. The size is perfect. </p>
<p>We still get a number of request to have some with transparent background, which would allow them as perfect decoration for any kind of devices.</p>
<h6>Geeko&#8217;s keyboard patch stickers</h6>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a very limited edition of Geeko&#8217;s keyboard patch stickers. For the first time, you will have pleasure to press the meta key.<br />
They literally create a rush on the booth, we save some to patch our demonstration computer with them.</p>
<p>I predict a long and successful life to this article. I hope future booth box will contain thousand of them.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth2.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth2-278x300.jpg" alt="fosdem-2014-booth2" width="278" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10510" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth2-278x300.jpg 278w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth2.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" /></a></p>
<h5>Table covers</h5>
<p>Done in synthetic material, colored with a beautiful green and proudly displaying the openSUSE logo. They are light resistant flexible.<br />
<br />Excellent article.</p>
<p>As there&#8217;s 2 models, one with big Geeko on top and the other one having openSUSE written on bottom front, they can&#8217;t be use for the same mission.<br />
What impact would have one with the big Geeko sitting on the front with just one openSUSE? We should have some others shoot to be sure to get the best model.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-flag.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-flag-128x300.jpg" alt="fosdem-2014-flag" width="128" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10511" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-flag-128x300.jpg 128w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-flag.jpg 175w" sizes="(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px" /></a></p>
<h5>Flag (alpha testing)</h5>
<p>We also got a kind of flag, in an alpha-state, we fixed it on top of an official SUSE roll-up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not sure how to use this one. As a stand-up like the open-mind poster, the who&#8217;s behind the message is bottom placed which<br />
is always a bit hidden if placed on a roll-up.<br />
As a flag, the holes are missing to use it on different kind of support.
</p>
<h3>Flyer &amp; brochure</h3>
<p>The cheat sheet encounter a big success, using the other side to present key related tools (obs, openqa, susestudio) allow people on booth to introduce them or talk about it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a number of commands that need to be removed from it (obsolete or deprecated way of doing things)</p>
<p>Flyer, even with the printing default and small shift in the bulb, find their audience.</p>
<h3>openSUSE DVD by Open Press</h3>
<p>We received finally 1400 DVD of the Open Press&#8217;s edition containing Live KDE / Gnome 64 bits. We spread out 1000 of them, 200 were split between Advocates for future events in Austria, Spain and Greece.</p>
<h3>openSUSE conference cube box &amp; penguins</h3>
<p>Those two articles were unfortunately a failure at Fosdem booth. They are over complicated to build, and need too much material (scissors, glue) and too much time (15 minutes pro piece)</p>
<p>They should have been used to advertise the conference, but are not practical, once assembled they took too much place. Same on printed material, A3 is too big for any bags.</p>
<p>Croatian team bring a lot of them to use them locally. If we want to keep those kind of article for booth the printed result should be perforated and you should able to build the object with only your ten fingers in less than a minute.</p>
<h2>Missing parts</h2>
<p>I can&#8217;t be satisfied with what we received, our booth look so poor compared to what we usually present to the public.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget those article can be sold</p>
<ul>
<li>t-shirts : where are our fancy and inspiriting t-shirts?</li>
<li>usb sticks</li>
<li>Pens</li>
<li>Pins</li>
<li>hat</li>
<li>plush : so beloved</li>
<li>Old Toad bottles (*)</li>
</ul>
<p>(*) About our Old Toad beer, I&#8217;ve explained to people that nothing is impossible if and only if the community will assume the responsibility about managing the stock, carrying the boxes, and drink or sell the minimal order in less than 6 months. We&#8217;ll see if a Old Toad Team appear soon.</p>
<h2>Computers</h2>
<p>Just a small remark, our two touchscreen computers (only one has accepted to come at Fosdem) start to show their age.</p>
<h2>First part conclusion</h2>
<p>I will conclude this article which was more oriented on the new marketing stuff. There&#8217;s still quite works to be 100% useful and successful. I will come back soon with another article with some thoughts about how openSUSE booth has worked and details we could improve in the future
</p>
<p>Thanks for your reading, comments &amp; feedback are open!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Fosdem + Hackaton</h2>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/tail.png" alt="Green Tail" width="256" height="249" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9272" /><br />
As any hackaton, you finish a bit exhausted. but what the hell, how rich was this week!</p>
<p>I will not come back on the long (could we say impressive) list of things done.<br />
<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:12.3_marketing_hackaton" title="Marketing Hackaton" target="_blank">Wiki Marketing</a><br />
or <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Artwork_Todo" title="Artwork todo" target="_blank">Artwork todo.</a></p>
<p>A enormous thanks to all participants :<br />
Carlos (victorck), Carlos (CarlosRibeiro), Izabel (IzabelleValverde), Kostas (warldofff), Ilias (zoumpis), Marcel (tux93), Richard (ilmehtar), Michal (|miska|). </p>
<p>Also they deserve a full bunch of applause, thanks to SUSE&#8217;s people!<br />
<br />
Augustin, Jos, Will, Christopher, Adrian, Henne, Jurgen, Kenneth, Cassio, Alberto, Ralf, Roland, James, Jan, Ludwig, Cornelius, Suzanne and at least a big dozen of others&#8230;<br />
<br />
For your clear engagement, your support to empower our community, your advises, your welcomes, and being so kind with the turbulent community&#8217;s Geekos we were&#8230;
</p>
<p><span id="more-9274"></span></p>
<h2>A Time of changes, and new challenges.</h2>
<p>
The motto we choose for our next <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org">conference</a> couldn&#8217;t be more appropriate, &#8220;Power to the Geekos&#8221;!<br />
<br />
What does that mean? Geeko&#8217;s mean you and me, the community members, contributors, lovers.<br />
So Geeko&#8217;s will have to empower themselves and get more and more implicated in the how, what, who, when, where we want to draw our project.<br />
<br />
No excuses, guys &amp; girls, if we can count on a strong partnership with SUSE our main sponsor, we will have to do our part of the job, like in any sane partnership. And this is true with any other sponsors we have already.
</p>
<p>
In a near future we will have to face some of our old daemons, and fix them, whatever they are.<br />
Conference (osc, summit), bugzilla, release cycle and process, factory, evergreen, tumbleweed, membership, goodies &amp; shop, mailing-list, next board election with 4 seats renewal and so on&#8230;<br />
<br />
So if any of those subject sound like a jungle jingle in your brain, be ready to stand up to help the community to grow.
</p>
<p>
Changes will shake for sure our community, but why being afraid or keeping an &#8220;old memory&#8217;s myth&#8221; attitude?<br />
<br />
Together we have the force to drive these changes, in a friendly way, and for the benefit of all. Do we take the risk to see some leaving? Maybe, but the world has change, and will not stop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold">if we go on avoiding riding the raging bull, what could be our future?</p>
<p>Learning how to work, talk, and live better together will be the hardest and long time challenge we will face.<br />
I mean, we will for sure not become a kind of &#8220;aseptic &amp; polite model&#8221;, just how to avoid to kick too quickly the reply button and comment&#8217;s field.<br />
<br />
Trying to understand what kind of people we&#8217;re interactive with, and make our best so they could feel good.</p>
<h3>So what is already a work in progress : </h3>
<ul>
<li> &#8211; 12.3 release : make noise, spread the word, show time !</li>
<li> &#8211; board transparency : yeap, we should know more &amp; more what work is done, who, what, when. (not the details especially for privacy) </li>
<li> &#8211; board tasks : concrete proposals from SUSE will need actions from our side to endorse the power and responsibility of doing.</li>
<li> &#8211; conference lead by community : osc13 in Thessaloniki, before being the ever cool&#8217;est place where to be in July need attention and effort from all of us. (Subscribing the opensuse-conference mailing list is a way to learn about progress, and stand-up for helping)</li>
<li> &#8211; community in charge</li>
</ul>
<h2>One word to conclude</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>what do you need when you write some text? Content, of course. Apart from your content you need an additional part to make it a shiny contribution: fonts! If you don&#8217;t know already: we have now a new repository dedicated just to fonts.</p>
<p><span id="more-8668"></span></p>
<p>With the invaluable work and effort from Petr Gajdos, Takashi Iwai, and all the creative designers, we now have more than 100 open source fonts in the <a title="M17N:fonts Repository" href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/M17N:/fonts/" target="_blank">M17N:fonts</a> repository. Most fonts are licensed under the <a title="Open Font License" href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL" target="_blank">OFL</a> or other open/free licenses. Thanks a lot to all! This repository contains fonts like the previously mentioned <a title="The Exo Typeface Family" href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/12/08/the-exo-typeface-family/" target="_blank">Exo typeface</a>, the famous <a href="Linux Libertine" target="_blank">Linux Libertine</a>, or fonts from the <a title="Google Webfonts" href="http://www.google.com/webfonts" target="_blank">Google Webfonts</a> page to name a few. With all these fonts available at your hand, you have many choices to make your text readable and attractive as you like, be it on the Web or in print.</p>
<p>Previous to openSUSE 12.1, all the fonts had a terrible naming convention: some contained a &#8220;fonts&#8221; prefix, other don&#8217;t. Now all fonts follow a naming convention to make it easy to find. So don&#8217;t be surprised when your font package has been renamed. If you need further information, check out my original idea from <a title="Invent Consistent Font Naming Schema/Central Font Repository" href="https://features.opensuse.org/313035" target="_blank">FATE#313035</a>. Packagers will probably find the article about <a title="How to package a font?" href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_Fonts" target="_blank">Packaging Fonts</a> in the openSUSE Wiki helpful.</p>
<p>The new M17N:fonts repository collects all fonts now and in the future. New fonts will appear and developed there. To use it, add the repository to your list:</p>
<pre>zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/M17N:/fonts/openSUSE_12.1/M17N:fonts.repo</pre>
<p>Currently, the supported distributions are openSUSE 11.4, 12.1, Evergreen 11.1, 11.2, Factory, Tumbleweed, as well as SLE11 SP1 and SP2.</p>
<p>Have fun and be creative with the new fonts! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some week ago, I&#8217;ve stumbled upon a very promising font project. It&#8217;s called the <a title="Exo Typeface Family" href="http://kck.st/tivQep" target="_blank">Exo Typeface Family</a> and I think this could be a valuable addition to our distribution:<br />
<span id="more-8285"></span></p>
<p>The sans serif font is beautifully crafted and contains 9(!) different width as you can see in the following graphic:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Exo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8288 alignnone" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Exo.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="364" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Exo.jpg 560w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Exo-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></a></p>
<p>Natanael, the graphic designer, wrote about his font:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Today Exo is already a very mature font family, with over 700 characters supporting most Western, Central and Eastern European languages &#8211; and it can still go further! This coverage has been reached for all 9 weights, the maximum possible on the web. Each weight has an upright style and the corresponding ‘true’ italic style. Many ‘techno’ fonts have only the simple slanted oblique companion styles, but for the highest typographic quality it is essential to have true italics that are drawn specially.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some unique <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType_feature_tag_list" target="_blank">OpenType features</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_caps" target="_blank">small caps</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature" target="_blank">discretionary ligatures</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType_feature_tag_list#OpenType_Typographic_Features">stylistic alternates</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_style_figures" target="_blank">old style figures</a>, tabular figures, fractions</li>
<li>a lot more&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>If this project reaches its funding goal it will be published in <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts" target="_blank">Google Web Fonts</a> under the <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL" target="_blank">SIL Open Font License</a>. Currently, almost 80% is pledged, but only 18 days are left. If you find this project useful, please help Natanael and make the Web a more beautiful place. I already did so. Thanks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YaST2 got a lot of improvements which will be available in openSUSE 12.1. YaST doesn&#8217;t accidentally overwrite configuration files anymore (last bug fixed <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) and <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/04/01/introducing-snapper/">snapper</a> provides a rollback function for configuration options, just to mention a few. Therefore it&#8217;s time to give YaST2 a new and fresh style. As YaST Qt supports <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2008/12/23/yast-qt4-stylesheet-editor/">Stylesheets</a> it&#8217;s simple to influence YaST&#8217;s style.</p>
<p><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/yaststyle.png" alt="Screenshot of YaST's New Style" /></p>
<p>FACTORY contains the new style already. Packages for older releases are also available in my build service project: <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:tgoettlicher:Factory&amp;package=branding- openSUSE">http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:tgoettlicher:Factory&amp;package=branding-openSUSE</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you like it. You can use  <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2008/12/23/yast-qt4-stylesheet-editor/">YaST&#8217;s  Stylesheet Editor</a> to play around the the stylesheet as described in my this <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2008/12/23/yast-qt4-stylesheet-editor/">blog post</a>. Please send me improvements you want to share. Thanks.</p>

<h3>Imagine it!</h3>
<p>A few months ago, I&#8217;ve started to look for my next car. Then a crazy idea emerged, why not a Geeko&#8217;s car?
</p>
<h3>Find it!</h3>
<p>At that time Gilbert my mechanic <a href="http://www.garagedelavenir.ch" title="Garage de l'avenir">[www]</a> told me that Ford will get a new Fiesta model called Sport+ with a more powerful engine, a new look &amp; feel. I went to the exhibition and made a short test drive. The car was cool. The exhibit model was in blue with 2 white stripes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;clear:both:font-size:small"><span style="color:navy">Blue?</span> <span style="color:green">Green</span> would have been cool isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><span id="more-8048"></span><br />
<div id="attachment_8047" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1149.jpg"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1149-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-8047" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1149-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1149-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fiesta Sport+ with original stripes</p></div></p>
<h3>Draw it!</h3>
<p>Several weeks have past (Gnome3 launch, DesktopSummit, OSC11 preparation), but the idea stayed in my mind. Good news, the model exist in white with blue stripes too.</p>
<p><p>After finding a collada model compatible with Blender and pattern for printers coming from ccvision.de (Ford_231 for reference) I started imagine how I can transform it. Playing with demo pictures gimp, blender and inkscape, my project started to look as I wanted : <span style="color:green">green it will be!</span></p>
<h3>Order it!</h3>
<p>
End of August the things became more serious, the old one was on good shape, the price and primes for the new one were all interesting and inside my budget, let&#8217;s order it!<br />
Unfortunately, the delay to get the car and the design done before OSC11 was too short. At least let&#8217;s get the car nude white.</p>
<p>
No need to say that we enjoyed the journey to Nuremberg with the new car.  Okay back home I let the car for two days with the instructions to print it.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold">Gosh the result totally blew my mind!</h3>
