				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a new tool that provides a simple zenity based GUI frontend to <a title="live-fat-stick" href="https://github.com/cyberorg/live-fat-stick">live-fat-stick</a> script. The <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2012/09/13/live-fat-stick/">live-fat-stick</a> script allows you to create multi boot USB stick/HDD which has vfat partition on it without formatting or removing existing data on it, it uses whole ISO images to boot so the image is still usable to create more live USB sticks or burn CD/DVDs. In live mode the device&#8217;s vfat partition can be mounted to access/modify and save files.</p>
<p>Currently live CD/DVD isos of openSUSE 12.2(and derivatives) including all from <a href="http://susestudio.com">susestudio</a>, Mint, Ubuntu(and derivatives) and Fedora are supported. Fedora iso is not copied but is extracted on the USB device instead as it does not support booting from iso image yet.</p>
<p>Here is Live USB GUI in action:<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the <a title="hackweek" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hackweek">hackweek</a>, I have decided to take a look onto a boot process to realize, how fast can be boot of the system. This metric is considered as a not important, especially in a geek community. But I am sure that this is an important part of user experience. Following text is mean to share my investigations with you &#8211; but you should be aware what you are doing, since I have been focused on reducing the boot time as much as possible.</p>
<h2>A bit of theory</h2>
<p>Basically you have three possibilities how to make your boot fast.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start things in a <strong>parallel.</strong></li>
<li>Start things <strong>on demand.</strong></li>
<li>Start <strong>less</strong> things.</li>
</ol>
<h2>&#8230; root of all evil &#8230;</h2>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Premature optimization is the root of all evil.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And I will modestly extend Donald Knuth&#8217;s sentence, that the <strong>blind</strong> optimization as well. So if we have to optimize something, we have to know what to do. Fortunately <tt>systemd</tt> comes with an excellent tool called <tt>systemd-analyze</tt>, which show us our boot in several ways.</p>
<p>The simple run of command prints the time we spent in a boot and in which phase.</p>
<pre># systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 8480ms (kernel) + 30873ms (userspace) = 39353ms</pre>
<p>That was the default (minimal X system) 12.2 installation on my EEE 701 netbook, which is probably not suitable to work as nowadays <del>cell</del>smarphone, because is pathetically slow. On the other hand is it a perfect playground, so let&#8217;s continue with an investigating.</p>
<p>The overall time is nice, but won&#8217;t help to know what&#8217;s going on. There are two more subcommands, <code>blame</code> and <code>plot</code> shows us more information about the boot. The first shows the services sorted by the start time. The ones boots so long are those we should kicked off as a first ones.</p>
<p>Let see what slow the boot down a most</p>
<pre>$ systemd-analyze blame | head
 11385ms network.service
  5664ms SuSEfirewall2_init.service
  5575ms systemd-vconsole-setup.service
  3032ms ntp.service
  2840ms remount-rootfs.service
  2230ms postfix.service
  2021ms network-remotefs.service
  1925ms cpufreq.service
  1661ms SuSEfirewall2_setup.service
  1506ms xdm.service</pre>
<p>And take look at the output of <code>systemd-analyze plot</code> command</p>
<p><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/plot001.gif" alt="openSUSE 12.2 boot diagram" /></p>
<p>You can see, that there is a long chain of <code>SuSEfirewall2_init</code> -&gt; <code>network</code> -&gt; <code>network-remotefs</code> -&gt; <code>SuSEfirewall2_setup</code> tooks several dozen seconds to be finished. And nothing is wrong with that, but that is the server solution, not what I want to have on my tiny laptop.</p>
<h2>Making a laptop boot twice more faster</h2>
<p>So having the complex dependencies of several services in mind, I decided to mask some of them. Masking in systemd world means the service cannot be started using systemd, so it becomes invisible for it. I masked those</p>
<ul>
<li><code>network.service</code> &#8211; will be replaced by NetworkManager, which is more suitable for laptops usage</li>
<li><code>SuSEfirewall2_init</code> and <code>SuSEfirewall2_setup</code> &#8211; even if it&#8217;s a security feature, a risc for laptop, which is mostly offline and running only <code>sshd</code> is pretty small.</li>
<li><code>ntp.service</code>, <code>network-remotefs.service</code> &#8211; those does not makes a sense on my laptop</li>
<li><code>postfix.service</code> &#8211; I do not want to send emails via <code>/usr/bin/sendmail</code></li>
<li><code>cpufreq.service</code> &#8211; it is even not supported by my CPU (grep rc.cpufreq /var/log/messages)</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not forget to install NetworkManager and the applet and change the <code>/etc/sysconfig/network/config</code> and reboot.</p>
<p>Now we have</p>
<pre>
$ systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 8528ms (kernel) + 11123ms (userspace) = 19652ms
</pre>
<h2>Using an strace with systemd</h2>
<p>Now we have a list of worse services</p>
<pre>
$ systemd-analyze blame | head -n 10
  5476ms xdm.service
  4172ms systemd-vconsole-setup.service
  3950ms systemd-modules-load.service
  2781ms remount-rootfs.service
  1848ms NetworkManager.service
  1439ms media.mount
  1426ms systemd-remount-api-vfs.service
  1419ms dev-hugepages.mount
  1411ms dev-mqueue.mount
  1371ms sys-kernel-debug.mount
</pre>
<p>and a proper boot chart</p>
<p><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/plot002.gif" alt="bootchart w/o network.service" /></p>
<p>It shows us an another botleneck, which is the <code>systemd-vconsole-setup.service</code>, because it delay the <code>sysinit.target</code>, which is very early boot stage. In case like this, we can only use <code>strace</code> to know, what is taking too long. And debugging is pretty straightforward in systemd world. All we have to do is copy service file to<code> /etc/systemd/system</code> and change the <code>ExecStart</code></p>
<pre>
ExecStart=/usr/bin/strace -f -tt -o /run/%N.strace /lib/systemd/systemd-vconsole-setup
</pre>
<p>and reboot. Then you will find the output in <code>/run/systemd-vconsole-setup.strace</code> with a timestamps. Looking there it&#8217;s obvious calling <code>hwinfo --bios</code> is extremely expensive in this stage. You can speedup the unit by setting the <code>KBD_NUMLOCK</code> to yes or no in <code>/etc/sysconfig/keyboard</code>, or you can try to mask it completely I did.</p>
<p>The next service needs to closer look was system-modules-load &#8211; then <code>strace</code> says that it spent 2(!) in <code>init_module()</code> for module <code>microcode</code>. I disabled it as well, even for CPUs needs it can&#8217;t be recommended.</p>
<h2>Native systemd units</h2>
<p>There is one tiny init script called <code>purge-kernels</code>, which starts for 300ms according blame. And in this particular case systemd alternative will be way more effective</p>
<pre>
$ cat /etc/systemd/system/purge-kernels.service
[Unit]
Description=Purge old kernels
After=local_fs.target
ConditionPathExists=/boot/do_pure_kernels

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/sbin/purge-kernels
</pre>
<p>because systemd only do one stat on the file and do not run it at all, so this service disappears from the <code>blame</code> at all.</p>
<h2>The kernel time</h2>
<p>There is one interesting thing about kernel time &#8211; 8 seconds spent there seems to be a lot to me. Simple ls on /boot gave me a pointer</p>
<pre>
$ ls -lh /boot/vmlinuz-* /boot/initrd-*
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  14M Jul 24 11:03 /boot/initrd-3.4.4-1.1-desktop
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4.7M Jul 10 15:48 /boot/vmlinuz-3.4.4-1.1-desktop
</pre>
<p>The <code>initrd</code> is huge, around <strong>three</strong> times bigger than kernel? So let&#8217;s try to find what caused that. Every package can add it&#8217;s own setup script into /lib/mkinitrd/scripts/ thus let ask rpm whose did that</p>
<pre>
$ rpm -qf /lib/mkinitrd/scripts/setup-* | sort -u
cifs-utils-5.5-2.2.2.i586
cryptsetup-1.4.2-3.2.1.i586
device-mapper-1.02.63-26.1.1.i586
dmraid-1.0.0.rc16-18.2.1.i586
kpartx-0.4.9-3.1.1.i586
lvm2-2.02.84-26.1.1.i586
mdadm-3.2.5-3.3.2.i586
mkinitrd-2.7.0-62.2.1.i586
multipath-tools-0.4.9-3.1.1.i586
plymouth-scripts-0.8.5.1-1.3.1.noarch
splashy-0.3.13-35.1.1.i586
</pre>
<p>So I went through a list and try to uninstall things I do not need</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cifs-utils</code> &#8211; if you do not have any windows disc to mount, you can remove, but no impact on initrd size</li>
<li><code>cryptsetup</code> &#8211; this is a popular service for laptops, but I do not have any luks device, so let skip that. It removes a half of Yast as well, so I saved 18M of space, but a little in initrd.</li>
<li><code>device-mapper</code>, <code>dmraid</code>, <code>kpartx</code> and <code>lvm2</code> &#8211; cannot be easily removed as too much low-level stuff depends on it</li>
<li><code>mdadm</code> &#8211; no linux md devides, skip that</li>
<li><code>mkinitrd</code> &#8211; removal can reduce initrd to zero, but we would need own kernel</li>
</li>
<p><code>multipath-tools</code> &#8211; no multipath device, let skip that</li>
<li><code>plymouth-scripts</code> &#8211; who would need the &#8220;fancy&#8221; boot when booting so fast? &#8211; reducing initrd to 8.9M</li>
<li><code>splashy</code> &#8211; the same &#8211; and reducing initrd to 6.6M</li>
</ul>
<p>So the things intended to provide fancy boot actually bloats the system. Let&#8217;s measure the impact of those changes</p>
<pre>
$ systemd-analyze
2781ms (kernel) + 4999ms (userspace) = 7780ms
</pre>
<p><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/plot003.gif" alt="bootchart w/o network.service" /></p>
<h2>And that&#8217;s all folks &#8230;?</h2>
<p>There are a lot of factors slowing our boot &#8211; reducing it to 8 seconds is not that bad. One have to go carefully through blame and plot output to see what delays his computer in start. I would say making NetworkManager default one at least when installing laptop pattern would be nice and simple change as well as continue on <em>&#8220;systemdifization&#8221;</em> of openSUSE.</p>
<p>There are few other tricks, which get us closer to the target time, but I&#8217;ll post them next day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some week ago, I&#8217;ve stumbled upon a very promising font project. It&#8217;s called the <a title="Exo Typeface Family" href="http://kck.st/tivQep" target="_blank">Exo Typeface Family</a> and I think this could be a valuable addition to our distribution:<br />
<span id="more-8285"></span></p>
<p>The sans serif font is beautifully crafted and contains 9(!) different width as you can see in the following graphic:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Exo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8288 alignnone" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Exo.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="364" /></a></p>
<p>Natanael, the graphic designer, wrote about his font:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Today Exo is already a very mature font family, with over 700 characters supporting most Western, Central and Eastern European languages &#8211; and it can still go further! This coverage has been reached for all 9 weights, the maximum possible on the web. Each weight has an upright style and the corresponding ‘true’ italic style. Many ‘techno’ fonts have only the simple slanted oblique companion styles, but for the highest typographic quality it is essential to have true italics that are drawn specially.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some unique <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType_feature_tag_list" target="_blank">OpenType features</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_caps" target="_blank">small caps</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature" target="_blank">discretionary ligatures</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType_feature_tag_list#OpenType_Typographic_Features">stylistic alternates</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_style_figures" target="_blank">old style figures</a>, tabular figures, fractions</li>
<li>a lot more&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>If this project reaches its funding goal it will be published in <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts" target="_blank">Google Web Fonts</a> under the <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL" target="_blank">SIL Open Font License</a>. Currently, almost 80% is pledged, but only 18 days are left. If you find this project useful, please help Natanael and make the Web a more beautiful place. I already did so. Thanks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YaST2 got a lot of improvements which will be available in openSUSE 12.1. YaST doesn&#8217;t accidentally overwrite configuration files anymore (last bug fixed <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" />  ) and <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/04/01/introducing-snapper/">snapper</a> provides a rollback function for configuration options, just to mention a few. Therefore it&#8217;s time to give YaST2 a new and fresh style. As YaST Qt supports <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2008/12/23/yast-qt4-stylesheet-editor/">Stylesheets</a> it&#8217;s simple to influence YaST&#8217;s style.</p>
<p><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/yaststyle.png" alt="Screenshot of YaST's New Style" /></p>
<p>FACTORY contains the new style already.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past days I&#8217;ve been packaging and fixing some issues on Unity 2D for inclusion on the GNOME:Ayatana repository in the openSUSE Build Service.</p>
<p>This gave me an excellent opportunity to test a few components share by both, Unity and Unity 2D, which is the case of &#8216;unity-place-applications&#8217; and &#8216;unity-place-files&#8217;, both using Zeitgeist which is already in Factory for the upcoming openSUSE 12.1. We thank the integration of this packages to Federico Quintero. Thanks Fred.</p>
<p>A few more additional packages need some care and once they get updated and tested they will be uploaded to GNOME:Ayatana, at which time I will provide an installer (1-Click) for those willing to test Unity-2D. Unity 2D will be the first application to use the indicators I have prepared in the past which all all found working, except 1, the AppMenu (strangely it works on GNOME2 panel without issues).</p>
<p>This is how Unity 2D looks like. There are transparencies because I enabled &#8216;composite&#8217; on metacity, which works very nicely. As far as I could understand, the developers of Unity 2D are also looking into implementing Compiz with Unity 2D, which would be sweet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7354" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot.png" alt="" width="720" height="404" /></a></p>
<p>Unity introduces the &#8216;dash&#8217; which is pretty much the following screen. Transparencies are enabled (though metacity composite) and the notification bubble belongs to NotifyOSD (already present in openSUSE 11.4 as optional). This is one of the three issues I have to fix, the icons displayed on the dash should have text underneath, it&#8217;s not showing. The top icons are quick links to Program Categories and the ones bellow are the default applications which are setup in GNOME.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7355" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot1.png" alt="" width="720" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The launcher panel on the side auto-hides, and seems to be working. The three icons displayed in last are respectively: Workspace selector, applications menu and files. Everything seems to be working with them, and the 2 last are components shared with Unity, and they both rely on Zeitgeist. Here&#8217;s a few captures of what they do&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7356" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot2.png" alt="" width="720" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7357" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="720" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot-2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-7358  aligncenter" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="730" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">There&#8217;s also a feature from Unity which is cute&#8230; The title artifact of the decorator window (metacity, which required a few patches) is removed and implemented on the top bar when the window is maximized. Sadly for me the AppMenu (menu proxy) isn&#8217;t working properly, this is another thing that needs fixing&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot3.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-7363    aligncenter" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot3.png" alt="" width="720" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">This should cover pretty much the functionality that is available currently. There&#8217;s a few issues still remaining before I can push this to GNOME:Ayatana:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">- I tried not to have the need to patch gnome-session, but since Unity relies on the Session Indicator to have this functionality, gnome-session will need to be patched (should be ok, because it also requires the backport patch for  defining &#8211;sessions for openSUSE 11.4).</p>
<p style="text-align: left">- Unity 2D itself relies on a few gconf hacks that should be on a schema file. I&#8217;ve talked to upstream and this is planned already, so once it&#8217;s release, that&#8217;s when it will be published.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">- There&#8217;s one issue also with backgrounds and workspace switcher&#8230; unfortunatly the workspace switcher only renders wallpapers if they are in image format (no .xml stuff), so this can turn some wallpapers not to render, which eventually ends up in the background of the switcher being the one defined in GNOME as solid color.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">So the order of TODO&#8217;s for GNOME:Ayatana is pretty much this one:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">1. Implement dependencies and then Unity 2D;<br />
2. Make sure Compiz is well implemented, because Unity will require Compiz at it&#8217;s best shape;<br />
3. Make sure nux and other twisted dependencies are properly implemented;<br />
4. Implement Unity itself;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">This are the latest news for GNOME:Ayatana&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This gives some thoughts to problems with our bugzilla and ways to better track our bugs.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>update</strong> 2012-02-07: Success: after <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=732504">bnc#732504</a> you can now open Advanced Search and find RESOLVED/DUPLICATE bugs by default. When bugs are finally solved and fixes released, those can then be moved to CLOSED state to no more appear in search results.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>bugzilla.novell.com aka bnc is the central tool to track bugs of openSUSE.</p>
<p>It has a guided bug submission form that helps &amp; encourages reporters to search for existing reports on an issue.</p>
<p>However, the integrated search function only shows open bugs. In principle that is nice, but bugs marked as duplicates of open bugs do not count as open. Also it is common that developers mark a bug as RESOLVED/FIXED as soon as they uploaded a patch into the OBS devel-project. Such a patch then needs some days until it gets into Factory or the Update repos where normal users would benefit from the fix. During that time, there will still be people with all regular updates installed hitting the bug and not finding it on bugzilla because it is no more marked open. Of course, one could also search for RESOLVED bugs, but this brings up a huge list of issues that are long solved, but never were marked CLOSED (e.g. openSUSE-11.3 has 453 CLOSED vs 2727 RESOLVED).</p>
<p>This wastes time of reporters writing a duplicate bug-report and wastes time of developers having to figure out that it really is a dup. This is probably why <a href="http://neowiki.neooffice.org/index.php/Bugzilla_Guide#Assigned">other projects</a> recommend setting bugs to ASSIGNED/FIXED until the patch is released. Unfortunately bnc lacks this state.</p>
<p>Also bugzilla has an UNCONFIRMED state for new bugs that need triaging to get into the NEW state (named &#8220;Reproducible but not assigned&#8221; in <a href="http://neowiki.neooffice.org/index.php/Bugzilla_Guide#Reproducible_but_not_assigned">other projects</a>). Such a state is unavailable on bnc, so that people can not tell apart bugs that have been forgotten from bugs that are known to exist, but just wait for a developer to fix.</p>
<p>There was also little integration between OBS and bnc. I have therefore written <a href="http://www.zq1.de/~bernhard/linux/obs/">scripts</a> to update bugzilla entries with links to submit requests on OBS mentioning e.g. <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=685133">bnc#685133</a> (&lt;=see link for how it looks like). But it still could be made <a href="https://features.opensuse.org/312155">a lot more useful</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, there is some room for improvement to make people&#8217;s lives easier, and allow us having a lot of fun&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the last <a href="http://community.opensuse.org/meetings/opensuse-project/2010/opensuse-project.2010-11-17-16.08.html">openSUSE project meeting</a> and after the discussion about &#8220;zombie&#8221; bugs on the opensuse-project mailing list, a small team of volunteers agreed to organize a Bug Day on Saturday, November 27th. What is a Bug Day? This is a day when many people from the community help to triage bugs in <a href="bugzilla.novell.com">Bugzilla</a>. It is a good and easy way to get involved in the openSUSE project!</p>
<p>Here is what you need to participate:<br />
 &#8211; a recent version of openSUSE (11.3 or a milestone of 11.4). It&#8217;s okay to run openSUSE in a virtual machine.<br />
 &#8211; an IRC client to interact with the other participants<br />
 &#8211; good mood <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>A small team will organize the event by providing lists of bugs, and will be available to guide new contributors if needed. So it will be easy to help!</p>
<p>For this specific Bug Day, we will focus on the &#8220;zombie&#8221; bug reports: those are reports against old versions of openSUSE (openSUSE 10.x and 11.0). As some reports might still be valid, we don&#8217;t want to close all of them automatically. We will therefore check all those reports to see if they are still valid in the latest version of openSUSE (11.3 or a milestone of 11.4). The goal is to close those bug reports if possible, or, if they are still valid, to move them to a current version of openSUSE so that they&#8217;re not lost in limbo. So during a full day, people come on irc and help each other triage bugs.</p>
<p>Please note that this is only for openSUSE bugs (living in bugzilla.novell.com), but a solution for some bugs might be to forward them upstream.</p>
<p>Come on #opensuse-bug (freenode) on a Saturday 27.11.2010, we&#8217;ll be glad to have you join the fun! <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>Thank you guys! I like the thrilling name. <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a static page (at the moment?) and collects the current documentation from several products and projects. Probably you will see more to come in the next weeks.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
<p><strong>Update (AJ since Thomas is ill) 2010-10-27:</strong> Based on the feedback received, we&#8217;re going to  change now rtfm.opensuse.org to docs.opensuse.org. So, you can reach the fine side under <a href="http://docs.opensuse.org">http://docs.opensuse.org</a> and <a href="http://doc.opensuse.org">http://doc.opensuse.org</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>this post is just request for all obs-packagers. Please, don&#8217;t forget write some documentation about your projects (which you maintain or develop). I mean, documentation for developers. This make more easy to understand logic of program, connection between some modules inside or interfaces between widget/applet and &#8220;system/hardware part&#8221;. For sure, comments in source code (or in changelog) help, but some times they give not so much clarity.</p>
<p>This is not so complicated to write one-two pages about project, which you hack. This also can save time of new developers. They will not ask you about architecture of project, and that will save your time too <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how will be better to do it: use wiki (create a new page) or add just text-file in source project. Anyway it&#8217;s not so important where will be this documentation, main things that this documentation will be exist <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For long I had been using my old laptop for everything; building images with KIWI, writing documents using LaTeX and Docbook XML, sorting my photos with Digikam. I have been upgrading since version 9.0 and at the moment opensuse 11.1 was the release ( OK with lots of new software thanks to the Build server. However, for some odd reason I wanted to have something new. Dangerous word, new is.</p>
<p>I have 2 Intel Atom&#8217;s running for my mail and web servers and I was quite happy with their performances, (by the way I am still happy). Hence I decided to ride the change train and bought the Intel D510 board</p>
<p>opensuse 11.3 Kde LiveCd worked fine and using Susestudio I designed my image. So far was really good. Booting the usb brought my feet back to earth. A frozen screen. So I tried the failsafe option and I had a 800X600 display. Reboot and this time trying &#8220;nomodeset&#8221; option same thing. Nevertheless I decided to give it a go ( I can always use it at run level 3).</p>
<p>Last night I have decided to include the Kernel:HEAD repo so I am using kernel-default-2.6.36-rc6.25.1.x86_64 along with the X11:XOrg repos using X.Org 1.9.0.901 (1.9.1 RC 1) so now I have &#8220;1366&#215;768 (the max my monitor can give) and I do not need to set &#8220;nomodeset&#8221; in the boot options anymore.</p>
<p>I have not tweaked everything yet, like my Logitech keyboard&#8217;s multimedia keys are useless in KDE at the moment.  At the end they will work one way or the other, I am sure.</p>
<p>Lesson Learned: do your homework well before jumping the change train or enjoy the adventures</p>
