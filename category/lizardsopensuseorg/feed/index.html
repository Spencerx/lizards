I can code with javascript and I&#8217;m fairly good at it (not marvelous just brialiant!). If you have read some of my resent <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/15/opensuse-and-gcc-part-2/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 2: compiling ‘Hello World’">blog</a> <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/11/12/opensuse-and-gcc-part-6/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 6: Introduction to autotools">post</a> I think in C/C++/Perl or Bash. I also have some kind of a hobby to help out with <a href="http://unrealworld.fi">UnReal world RPG</a> game. Mostly my part is to make it work with *nix platform (mainly Linux and Mac OS X).<br />
As we have seen world is moving fast forward towards web. It&#8217;s  the-place-to-be for everyone. There is huge potential for players just wandering around and yelling for pleasure to play UrW! So I thought let&#8217;s see if we could port SDL to javascript/Flash or something straight from same source. after tiny amount of searching I popped up <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten" title="Emscripten">Emscripten</a>.<span id="more-10686"></span></p>
<h2>Emscripten in nutshell</h2>
<p>Emscripten is stated in their Github page (which seems to be only place to reach this project) like this:</p>
<pre>
Emscripten is an LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler. It takes LLVM bitcode - which can be generated from C/C++, using llvm-gcc or clang, or any other language that can be converted into LLVM - and compiles that into JavaScript, which can be run on the web (or anywhere else JavaScript can run).
</pre>
<p>So in other words you can your existing C++ or C source code and compile it (with minor changes) to javascript pseudocode with LLVM back-end. I thought it can&#8217;t be working and started digging further.</p>
<h2>How to test it on openSUSE</h2>
<p>If you have openSUSE 12.3 or above you are good to go or you need to install LLVM 3.2 or above from OBS. You can do it with zypper like this:</p>
<pre>
zypper install llvm llvm-devel llvm-clang llvm-clang-devel git nodejs
</pre>
<p>Ain&#8217;t Clang just another C-compiler? So why not use GCC? Answer is  LLVM is very flexible system (GCC is kinda married to C/C++. even there is many other backends) that turns code to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" title="Abstract syntax tree">Abstract syntax tree</a> and then back-end compiles it to binary (which can anything from machine code to some of your favorite byte code like Java/C#). So in other words you have parser (clang) and you write back-end to generate code (javascript) quite easily (in theory). I think it was kind idea behind GCC in version 3.0 but as said it doesn&#8217;t work as seamlessly as it works in LLVM. Another strong point with LLVM is license. (L)GPL is fine license but if you have compiler you license should be as free as it gets.</p>
<h2>So HOW TO TEST IT?</h2>
<p>I haven&#8217;t got time to make rpm-package from Emscripten because I&#8217;m still learning by myself but I&#8217;ll share now what I have learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">Read documentatio</a>n</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/Tutorial">Read documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://kripken.github.io/clangor/demo.html">Read documentation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok now you have read Emscripten documentation and you have clang, nodejs and git installed. Clone the Emscripten Git-repo</p>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/kripken/emscripten.git
</pre>
<p>If you just want to test something you can follow this tutorial: <a href="http://sol.gfxile.net/emscripten/">http://sol.gfxile.net/emscripten/</a> so you get the idea. This how far I&#8217;ll take you this time. I&#8217;ll figure out some SDL examples to be ported (since UnReal World RPG uses SDL) in near future so stay tuned. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have time to setup real solution and need something reliable test Zabbix (<a href="http://zabbix.com" title="Zabbix">http://zabbix.com</a>). Zabbix is wonderful all in one solutions for monitoring network and your hosts (servers). If you are in need of knowing how good you Internet/(W)LAN connections is then things are getting complicated.<span id="more-10639"></span><br />
Case is like this: You have computer and WIFI-card (Wireless Internet card). Most of the time it&#8217;s working great! Speed is high and there is no hick-ups any kind. Out of the blue comes troubles. In other network video is not playing from net or you keep getting connection errors in browser.. so what to do? How to debug this one? It can be that other people are just consuming all the router bandwidth available or there is many WIFI routers in same frequency (be sure to check first all the hardware before getting into software level). If hardware is not the case and you have double checked with normal Wire connection to Internet/LAN then there is definitely something else. With WIFI connection it still can be your grandma’s old beloved 1950 microwave oven (If you on 5Ghz band then you can&#8217;t blame her either)..<br />
So I assume you are on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP" title="TCP/IP">TCP/IP</a>-network if you don&#8217;t know what it is you should first find out and then read the rest of this story.<br />
WIFI-cards have signal strength monitor. I have notice that many times it&#8217;s just a estimation. You can have 100% strength and your connection is next to nothing. Manufacturers tends to make connections look way too better than they are or they make them look even worst than they are.<br />
So how to find out is my connection good or bad? Word of warning in this point: this is just one way to find out and it&#8217;s not very good (for some use cases it is). Way is to use little bit BASH (Bourne Again SHell) and <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Ping-in-Linux" title="ping">ping-command</a> which is installed in openSUSE default.</p>
<h2>What ping does</h2>
<p>Ping consumes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol" title="ICMP">ICMP-protocol</a> which is very low level and I don&#8217;t know is it used for anything anymore these days (correct me if I&#8217;m very wrong) only with ping-command. If Wikipedia is correct ping calculates round-trip so how long takes data to find it&#8217;s way to server and come back (Small tip here! You can use <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/unix/utracero.htm" title="Traceroute">traceroute</a> to see how you packet is finding it&#8217;s way on the Internet and back to you).<br />
So how can I use ping to tell me is my server up? Short answer is simple: &#8216;you can&#8217;t&#8217;. Little bit longer answer: &#8216;Yes you can but it&#8217;s little bit more complicated than you first thought&#8217; and the long version: &#8216;You get information about if your server&#8217;s network card answers to (and most of the time kernel network stack) received ICMP-packet. If there is firewall rule that turns ICMP-packet answer off you are out of luck. Ping doesn&#8217;t tell if your service is up or Apache running correctly and reliable. Remember ping answer can work even if most of user space is smashed down and kernel is malfunctioning (been there done that!)&#8217;.<br />
So what you get it answer from network card and that&#8217;s it. If it&#8217;s enough (99% times it is) keep reading.</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>Show me code you scream and I give it to you and please read comments on code before using. This is edited version from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18258364/ping-tool-to-check-if-server-is-online" title="Stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow.com</a> message script (so nothing original here):</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash

echo "Press [CTRL+C] to stop.."

# Make at least 10 pings in one time
COUNT=50
SUCCESS=0
LASTFAIL=NONE
# Change this to Domain name/IP
# or ip you want to monitor
IP=192.168.1.1
FAILS=0

while true
do
        #
        # Ping with interval 0.5s to IP (192.168.1.1)
        # COUNT (50) times
        # after that we just grep 'byte from' from output
        # or ping and them calculate how many we got
        # with wc -l (Lines of output) bacause we drop
        # other from output
        # You can use up (normally) 2000 size (-s) of package
        # to see if it's starts to drop..
        LINES=$(ping -s 1024 -i 0.5 -c ${COUNT} ${IP} | \
                grep "bytes from ${SERVERSERVER}" | wc -l)

        # Calculate how many fails there were
        let FAILS=${COUNT}-${LINES}+${FAILS}
        # Add to success rate
        let SUCCESS=${LINES}+${SUCCESS}

        # If there were error but date to LASTFAIL
        # so if you not every moment looking you can
        # see when this error happened
        if [ ${LINES} -ne ${COUNT} ]; then
             LASTFAIL=$(date)
        fi

        # Ok ping all together failed
        if [ $? -ne 0 ] ; then
          echo "Can't Connect to server ${IP}"
        else
          # Print statistics to screen
          echo "$(date) ${IP} Success: ${LINES} (Tot. F ${FAILS}) \
(Tot. S ${SUCCESS}) (Last F ${LASTFAIL})"
        fi

        # Sleep a while (not consume all the bandwidth)
        sleep 1
done
</pre>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Script prints mystical output. Things that matters that Success rate is 50 (or what pinging rate you are using) and Fails are not rising fast. It they are rising fast packets are dropped if you are not getting anything check IP/domain name. With this one you can get ping time. If success level is 50 but ping time is high you network is still very slow but that you have to check with ping-command by hand. Even with 2G mobile modem you should get under 300ms (3G should be like 100ms).<br />
To have any clue about your connection you have make this at least 30 minutes (First ping packets can tell everything but if you want to see whole picture). Actually this is stupid way to find out is your server up but if your WIFI-card  is working everywhere else great you can check are you packets going through. If ICMP-packets are dropping very fast then your TCP/IP packages are dropping very fast and you network stack have to re-send them so you notice that your network is slow (even though it has nothing to do with that). Again it can be route, WIFI-card or firewall problem still.. and ping doesn&#8217;t answer to that question. So this was this days script stuff. If you have better ways to do this.. please share I&#8217;m always interested in this topic.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I like to take you precious time to talk about thing that get so less attention in open source world. I like to talk little bit about QA and Coding guidelines.<br />
Many reader who are in companies that take care of themselves or are involved some major open source or free software project like KDE, GNOME or Linux kernel knows that they/we have Coding guidelines. KDE have it <a href="http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style" title="KDE code guidelines">here</a> and Kernel have it <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle" title="Kernel code guidelines">here</a>. So they have them and whats the big deal?<span id="more-10582"></span></p>
<h2>Why have code guideline and hang on it?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been coding since I was kid. I didn&#8217;t know better way to waste my time that sitting front of Commodore 64 and hack together some BASIC code and my code was horrible.<br />
I didn&#8217;t have any clue how to organize it or how to make it more readable (BASIC ain&#8217;t that BASIC when you try to read it afterwards). Years after some major Assembly experiences on 286 and 386 I found Pascal. Then I understood one thing. If you don&#8217;t understand your stuff you write you don&#8217;t understand it after a while! So I tried to be more constructed what I did (Pascal/Delphi still have soft spot in my heart.. always!) and forget it sort after that for almost 10 years.</p>
<h2>Doing it professionally</h2>
<p>If you code for living you have to be very sure you can read your code and others can also. You can stop developing your code after that someone else can come to maintaining that particular code and this is situation in open source most of the time.<br />
You never know how long you code will be used, forked or maintained by someone else brave after you have moved on to something more interesting.<br />
Following code guidelines is not very difficult. You just forget about your excuses about beauty of your code and ignorance about making code look solid with rest of application. Most horrible<br />
is read some code that where you have to learn how different people write code and their definition about good code guidelines.<br />
If you lazy like me you can use tools like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/" title="Artistic Style">http://astyle.sourceforge.net/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jsbeautifier.org/" title="Javascript beautifier">http://jsbeautifier.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_Beautifier" title="PHP Beautifier">http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_Beautifier</a>/</li>
</ul>
<h2>I do want my code to look like I did it</h2>
<p>No you don&#8217;t if you contribute to someone else project you make you code look like his or her code. Structured code is always looking good.<br />
We have policy that version control system make decision how code should look like. So there is some tool and version control hook script that structures code to what is our stated our code guidelines and believe me it have worked better than I expect. People still have to make changes but you have reply what is wrong. No more rants about what is correct looking code and people giving me excuses why code is not following code guidelines. There is only one that have dictatorship here and it&#8217;s version control system and 99.9% it does good job.</p>
<h2>Code guidelines are not equal Code quality</h2>
<p>No they are not. They have nothing to do with Code quality control or do they? openSUSE Build service have very good for everyone to take good example. To make your RPM package SPEC-file compile to binary or source RPM you have to follow machine checked rules. If you correct at least those it will be all okay. Scripts check that you don&#8217;t have million bytes long jargon in Summary-line or you have Summary-line at all. They run rpmlint and check C-code for some we&#8217;ll known problems. If they are qualified enough to go through this you won&#8217;t get your RPM/DEB/Arch-package.<br />
Now we can argue long time do static code checking have any value but long time user of static code checking tools like <a href="http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/" title="Cppcheck">cppcheck</a> I can tell static analyzing find many that people just ignore to find because they don&#8217;t have time to thing whole logic or understand that memory handling issue.<br />
Best way to use them I again run them on version control system hook before code gets in. It won&#8217;t make code perfect but you make developer fear for commiting and when developer fear they make better code.<br />
After you have structured code and machine checks it statically it&#8217;s much easier to get in to point and find problems. So you can talk about what is really wrong or right with code. It&#8217;s easier to read some text if that have passed thesaurus in Libreoffice and again openSUSE obs policy is very very efficient. It spots stuff that you don&#8217;t care about and yes I miss SPEC code structure-script in OBS but you can&#8217;t have all.<br />
Now it&#8217;s time make code guidelines to you project and use some tool to make all project look like it (My opinion is that have always some for example Artistic Style tool example how to structure code for your with code guidelines) and that FFmpeg stuff is coming when I feel it&#8217;s ready to rock!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been seeking cloud storage of my life for long time now. My needs are not much (but most of the time they are too big as I have learned) only space and if possible Linux/Mac OS X FUSE for using service.<br />
Service being open source or not isn&#8217;t such big thing in this case. How data is stored (crypted or not) and how can I get them out there if I need them is what I treasure most.<br />
I have tested <a href="https://spideroak.com/" title="SpideOak">SpiderOak</a>, <a href="https://spideroak.com" title="Wuala">Wuala</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://www.box.com/" title="Box">box.net</a> but non of them fits for my needs perfectly. As I want to use these services with Linux all of them have Linux clients and most of them have FUSE-filesystem. Lately I have been using Wuala but it has problem that FUSE stuff is written in Java (it works under openSUSE just fine!). With GUI it&#8217;s clean and like said works very well but then comes but if you don&#8217;t want to use GUI you are in little bit trouble. It&#8217;s supported but I haven&#8217;t got it working. Xvfb comes to rescue but still it&#8217;s not really a solution!<br />
When I heard about <a href="https://secure.elfcloud.fi/" title="elfcloud.fi">Elfcloud.fi</a> I though okay we have some storage provider in Finland no big deal. I just popped their web site and noticed that they are really open source friendly company. They <a href="https://github.com/elfCLOUD/elfcloud-weasel" title="Elfcloud.fi weasel">have Github Python-library</a> (Apache Version 2.0 licensed) and full <a href="https://secure.elfcloud.fi/en/developers/api-doc/" title="Elfcloud.fi API docs">API documentation which is dead simple JSON</a> stuff also their pricing scheme ain&#8217;t that bad. I have mention that this is hardcore crypto cloud service. If you lose your key you can wave goodbye to you data. Best of all they gonna have marvelous FUSE implementation as I&#8217;m writing it currently (They also have C++ library available on request. Apache Version 2.0 licensed of course).<br />
So if you want to keep your data on Europe and have it stored in same country that have also is also trusted by Google datacenters and Microsoft you can check out elfcloud.fi. It&#8217;s not for everyone for sure but those who are in same need place to store data without hustle this can be the stuff for you. </p>
<p>You can download python API RPM from here: <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/illuusio:/elfcloud/" title="Elfcloud rpms">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/illuusio:/elfcloud/</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>First warning and please read it: If you wipe your harddisk, USB-stick or Flash with any of these tips. Your data won&#8217;t magically come back! After correct &#8216;secure rm&#8217; or &#8216;NWipe&#8217; there way is no way to bring your valuable data back. Make backups and happy wiping!<br />
</strong><br />
Destroying data permanently from hard disk is not as easy as you think. Sometime hard disks just self destructs without notice but when there is police behind you door knocking and you have destroy as much data as you can it&#8217;s little bit trickier. Even normal cases when there ain&#8217;t police at door and you just want to make sure that your old hard disk is clean and it doesn&#8217;t contain your personal data it&#8217;s a bit of a problem.<span id="more-10448"></span><br />
Removing with GUIs delete most times just sends files to Trash bin where they can be read normally. Same goes with deleting them permanently. It just tells to filesystem this part of hard disk is up for usage again. It takes many writes in that part of hard disk before it&#8217;s safe to say you can&#8217;t recover any of old data. So if you just accidentally deleted file and popped up here there is still hope but I won&#8217;t tell how to bring it back.<br />
One method for remove files permanently is use <a href="http://srm.sourceforge.net/" title="Secure rm">secure rm</a> (srm for short). It&#8217;s not fastest way to remove files but after running srm no-one can read your file again and like I say on topic <em>there is no way to bring file back!</em>. Secure rm is nice but it doesn&#8217;t wipe your hard disk entirely.</p>
<h2>DBAN</h2>
<p>If you needed hard disk wiping &#8216;<a href="http://www.dban.org/" title="DBAN">Darik&#8217;s Boot And Nuke</a> A.K.A DBAN&#8217; is tool for you. Currently it&#8217;s obtained by Finnish firm that uses same stuff <a href="http://www.blancco.com/en/home/" title="Blancco">so if you are need of professional supported stuff go and ask them</a>. If you are just need for tool for wiping hard disk data go, download and burn latest DBAN image. it&#8217;s easy to use and it will destroy data. Again data is gone after DBAN has runned with default configs so really make backups! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9jfLDrm2Q0" title="Learn to use DBAN">This is video how to make it with DBAN.</a> If you not pro watch it fully before making any moves.</p>
<h2>I don&#8217;t want to burn anything to CDR</h2>
<p>Okay you are in that mood. Many of new laptop doesn&#8217;t contain CD-drive anymore so what to do. Here is my tip for you. <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Live_USB_stick" title="openSUSE USB Stick">Create bootable USB stick</a> (read whole thing before doing anything). After you have managed to boot your new shiny openSUSE USB-stick install <a href="http://www.andybev.com/index.php/Nwipe" title="NWipe">NWipe</a>. NWipe is fork of DBAN DWipe that does actual wiping that is ported to work without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file" title="What are devices and DevFS">devfs</a> (which is obsolette anyways). Install it <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/illuusio/" title="NWipe rpm">from here</a> with zypper (something like </p>
<pre>
zypper install <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/illuusio/openSUSE_13.1/x86_64/nwipe-0.14-3.1.x86_64.rpm" title="Link to rpm">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/illuusio/openSUSE_13.1/x86_64/nwipe-0.14-3.1.x86_64.rpm</a>
</pre>
<p>) after that run &#8216;nwipe&#8217; application and make sure that you won&#8217;t clean your USB stick.<br />
After you have chose your partitions and way you want it to be done (I use American army stuff in for wiping but does NSA have some backdoor in those? I don&#8217;t know..) go a head and make your hard disk and processor suffer. <strong>Again once more bit FAT WARNING. If you want to make small joke for your dad or cause anyone hard attack just destroy hard disk for fun there ain&#8217;t coming back (hope you have backups!).</strong> Your partition table is gone same goes with filesystem. No more seeking files with hex editor or dedicated applications. Your files are just random bytes in hard disk.<br />
and like openSUSE slogan is have a lots of fun when you wipe your disks!</p>

You can also compile <a href="http://debian.org" title="Debian ">Debian</a>, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" title="Ubuntu linux">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/" title="Arch Linux">Arch</a> and <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/" title="Fedora project">Fedora</a> (and couple more) but why on earth you want to do that? Short answer: because you can! Little bit longer answer: because you can and freedom is two way road. You can&#8217;t guess what Linux distribution or OS your user wants to use but you can make sure that you application is first class citizen in that Linux distribution.<span id="more-10387"></span> Of course You can use Fedora build service or Ubuntu launchpad but they are just for that distribution only. If it&#8217;s fine with you. Be happy and use these marvelous services. If you have woken up in night all sweat. Thinking all these openSUSE lizards that are unhappy because they can&#8217;t use your fabulous application.. it&#8217;s time to start sleeping well.</p>
<h2>Fedora distribution or RHEL</h2>
<p>RPM based Linux distributions are very easy with OBS. You just have to make SPEC file generic. If you like to do it right you should read <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_cross_distribution_howto" title="openSUSE:Build Service cross distribution howto">openSUSE:Build Service cross distribution howto</a> and learn how to do it.</p>
<h2>OBS and DEB based distributions</h2>
<p>This is little bit trickier but not much. You needed decent DSC-file (Most dsc files goes without changes. If you like to use Bzip2 file then you need to add &#8216;DEBTRANSFORM-TAR&#8217; in dsc-file) file and then you need &#8216;debian.tar.gz&#8217; in your project or &#8216;debian/&#8217;-dir in your project. What are files that you need in you debian package/dir? That is a very good question and it stays unanswered here because it&#8217;s not point of this blog. If you are curious enough you can always download &#8216;debian.tar.gz&#8217; from <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:illuusio:example/sdl_displaybitmap" title="OBS Example application">example application</a> and study files or look <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/HowToPackageForDebian" title="HowToPackageForDebian">Debian documentation</a> about it.</p>
<h2>Arch</h2>
<p>Arch is most unknown distribution for me but it has vibrant community and active development so providing packages to them is good thing. They seems to like live bleeding edge. So Just add Arch distribution in your project in OBS and then fill PKGBUILD-file with necessary lines and like magic you have Arch supported (<a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:illuusio:example/sdl_displaybitmap" title="PKGBUILD">Look at example PKGBUILD-file if you don&#8217;t understand a thing</a>).</p>
<p>This was it! No more articles about GCC or around it. Next I&#8217;ve going to dive low level Linux Multimedia especially in audio and FFmpeg (and how you do them in openSUSE). <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/author/illuusio/" title="Blog">if you haven&#8217;t read rest of articles and you feel you missed something</a>. Go on a read them and if you missed good <a href="http://smithfarm-thebrain.blogspot.fi/2013/08/opensuse-packaging-workflow.html" title="OBS client OSC">OSC-blog you can read it too</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was kid Commodore 64 was big thing and I played &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsQsKaMAek" title="Gateway to Apshai youtube">Gateway to Apshai</a>&#8216; hour after hour. It really hit me. Others liked Ultimas but &#8216;Gateway to Apshai&#8217; was THE thing to me. Years after C64 was gone with the wind I found world of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29" title="Rogue">Rogue</a>, <a href="http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Omega" title="Omega">Omega</a> and <a href="http://www.nethack.org/" title="Nethack">Nethack</a>. Sweetest of them was Omega. Omega&#8217;s World map was big and you could do what ever you like and wander around and you didn&#8217;t have to fight all the time. As this was a long, long time ago none of those games are no more in active development but Sami Maaranen is still developing unique northern hemisphere survival game called <a href="http://www.unrealworld.fi/" title="UnReal World RPG">UnReal World RPG</a>.<br />
<img src="http://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/17/16794/thumb_300x150/mainscreen318b3.PNG" alt="UnReal World RPG 3.18beta3 start screen" /><img src="http://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/17/16794/thumb_300x150/urw318-restock.png" alt="UnReal World RPG 3.18beta3" /><br />
See bigger pictures at <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/the-unreal-world" title="IndieDB UnReal World RPG">IndieDB</a><br />
<span id="more-10329"></span></p>
<h2>UnReal World RPG</h2>
<p>What makes UnReal World RPG so unique? Game is huge, difficult level is infernal and it&#8217;s all about survival in north (Iron-Age Finland actually). As said UnReal World RPG tries to be as quite realistic. You won&#8217;t find goblins nor elves around but UnReal World RPG gives you elks, mooses, bears, wolves, lynxes and really long dark cold winter. If you want to survive the arctic winter you have to try little bit harder (and you probably die). If you like to get into fight you probably die or you get serious wounds and you probably die soon because you can&#8217;t make fire.<br />
Many times this game feels a bit sadistic in modeling how hard it have been in Iron-Age Finland but developer Sami Maaranen (and co-designer Erkka Lehmus) have spent lots of time studying about old ways crafting things, building traps and living off the land in general. As said before learning curve in this game is bit steep but there are plenty of &#8216;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK7CXT67arU&amp;list=PLOCBEcNdfIeXVSaKDs97TMKlrdAGr72Pc" title="Let's Play UnReal World RPG">Let&#8217;s play</a>&#8216;-videos floating in Internet to help you out and you can&#8217;t find many games that gives you so much fun. So if you like survival games this is for you.</p>
<h2>This sounds good</h2>
<p>And it is. UnReal World RPG is not Open Source nor it&#8217;s Free Software but it&#8217;s free to play and download (no strings attached). Developer is only asking donations and if you like the game you should really consider to donate small amount to support the development.</p>
<h2>Little bit deeper look</h2>
<p>UnReal World, or shortly UrW, was first released in 1992 as more traditional fantasy roguelike game. Then it evolved and evolved steadily. URW started as MS DOS ascii based game after that was VGA/SVGA DOS upper memory semi graphics version. Third generation took URW to Windows world with SDL-library. At that point notorious rewrite of graphics, sounds and user interface was proceeded, but it was heavily tied to MS Windows world.</p>
<h2>porting UnReal World RPG</h2>
<p>In some point people started to tell in URW <a href="http://z3.invisionfree.com/UrW_forum/index.php?s=165de95ba5c0c30cbe32ddc45915032f&amp;act=idx" title="URW forum">forums</a> that they are playing URW in Wine (both Mac OS X and Linux). They were happy because it worked. Playing in Wine ain&#8217;t pleasant all the time as it&#8217;s with native game.<br />
Porting SDL 1.2 game to another platform is really nice. It only does what it states. You don&#8217;t have to worry about internals and differences between platforms you just figure out differences and make sure everything is working smooth. Although MSVC is very different compiler C than GCC&#8217;s one. There is even huge difference between Mac OS X libc and Linux libc. Even little bit bumpy ride everything went well at the end and version 3.13 was first Linux and Mac OS X native version released.<br />
Developing multiplatfrom has its&#8217; pains but now Linux and Mac OS X are released in same time as Windows version. I used openSUSE system as base Linux system for the port to Linux. Currently there is openSUSE RPM-version (Which is for Fedora also), Ubuntu/Debian DEB-version/Tar-ball and Mac OS X. Statistics show there is steadily growing phase of people coming from those platform to play URW. Only Ubuntu have currently 64-bit version because there is no demand on openSUSE or Fedora (people with Ubuntu just plays more games!).</p>
<h2>Game ON!</h2>
<p>If you don’t have anything else to do on your Christmas vacation: Go and grab <a href="http://www.unrealworld.fi/urw_linuxmirror.html" title="UnReal World RPG Linux download">UnReal World RPG new 3.18beta3</a> version when it&#8217;s hot hot hot. Find yourself building a cottage and swimming in lake or try to survive the arctic winter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine yourself in place where: you have succeeded to create best open source project ever appeared in face of earth. Your project has most fabulous source management system ever imagined (mostly coded by you) and you release tar balls often with plenty new neat features. You have managed that your project users provide some binary builds for Windows, Mac OS X and some bunch of Linux distributions. So your ride is smooth and pleasant (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs" title="Maslow's hierarchy of needs">Mr. Maslow just waves to you from bottom of pyramid</a>). Then black clouds arise and some Linux build manager who is doing binary builds for spefic important Linux distribution just vanishes upon the earth or you notice it would be nice to support more wide range of distributions than you allready have. Then you should consider using <a href="http://openbuildservice.org/" title="Open Build Service">Open Build Service</a> or openSUSE version of it known as <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/" title="OBS">OBS</a>.<span id="more-10255"></span></p>
<h2>OBS in nutshell</h2>
<p>Open Build Service started as named &#8216;openSUSE build Service&#8217; but name changed long time a go. Basic idea is that you can compile source package to binary package and do it on many different distributions and architectures same time. It sounds good and mostly it&#8217;s better than that.<br />
So last time I showed how to <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/12/03/opensuse-and-gcc-part-8-rpms-and-how-to-write-them/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 8: RPMs and how to write them">make RPM package</a> and now I&#8217;ll transfer it to OBS and build it. For not wasting time <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:illuusio:example" title="home:illuusio:example">I have already made project for it</a> under my home project. In project page there is plenty of stuff most of them we talk in last episode. As you can notice OBS has very good and clean web gui. All thought I&#8217;m hardcore fan of shell <strong>I really enjoy OBS webgui</strong>.</p>
<h2>Show me code</h2>
<p>If you sign up for OBS you get your own home directory and you can create sub-projects there like I did  <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:illuusio:example/sdl_displaybitmap" title="home:illuusio:example/sdl_displaybitmap">home:illuusio:example/sdl_displaybitmap</a> . Under package there is plenty of distributions currently build: Debian, Fedora, Arch and openSUSE of course. &#8216;sdl_displaybitmap.spec&#8217; is the same SPEC file as used last time with out any tuning and same goes with tar-ball file &#8216;sdl_displaybitmap-1.0.tar.bz2&#8242;. Other files you can ignore in this point.<br />
OBS thing is you can just push (with some excuses and oopses) your rpm spec file and get it compile. Now you should really read <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_guidelines" title="openSUSE:Packaging guidelines">openSUSE packaging documentation</a> because if you just gun ho forward like me did at the begin you gonna suffer and then suffer little more and then you probably die in misery and your children will be send in salt mines.</p>
<h2>This was it? now what?</h2>
<p>Look around and think if it&#8217;s for you. I like OBS enough to drop you a tip about it but it&#8217;s just my opinion. Take some time and learn how to use OBS and probably command line util &#8216;<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OSC" title="OSC">osc</a>&#8216;. Then you start to make extraneous RPM packages with OBS and start distributing your best-on-earth open source project binary packages for multiple Linux distributions with ease and speed you never have seen before or you just keep on doing what you are doing.</p>
<h2>But but I got closed source application and want to use this system</h2>
<p><strong>Okay this is shameless commercial part! Don&#8217;t read any futher if you don&#8217;t want to.</strong> Then you can <a href="http://ilmi.fi" title="Ilmi Solutions Oy">contact me</a> and i&#8217;ll consult you out or read one more <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/12/11/discussing-about-the-future-of-opensuse/" title="Open Build Servive">what reads here</a>. Like you probably find out they have version of OBS that is open source and if you set it up all by yourself it doesn&#8217;t cost you a dime or <a href="http://www.b1-systems.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=1&amp;lang=en" title="Open Build Service Consulting">save some time and buy support from B1</a> . it&#8217;s up to you again ;).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems this it&#8217;s already 8 of this 10 part series of using GCC with openSUSE. This time topic is: RPM. RPM started as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager" title="Rpm Package Manager">Redhat Package Manager</a> and then it involved to RPM package manager (self explaining acronym like GNU). RPM packages are just files containing all the needed stuff to install application, font or something else in to openSUSE system.<span id="more-10208"></span><br />
RPM is currently wide adopted in Linux distributions openSUSE, embedded Yocto, Fedora and Madriva for name few. Although Yocto can use Debian packages also as base. I have been using an <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/22/opensuse-and-gcc-part-3/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 3: RPM devel packages">example</a> program to <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/28/opensuse-and-gcc-part4/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 4: Pkg-config and what one can do with it">show how to develop</a> very easy application with openSUSE and GCC. Currently <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/11/19/opensuse-and-gcc-part-7/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 7: autotools and how I do it">it uses Autotools tools</a>. Take my advise your application is not worth of anything if you can&#8217;t delivery it to users. Most of the applications (especially closed source) under Linux are distributed as tar-ball format. RPM is not about having Windows style setup it&#8217;s about knowing what is installed in you system.</p>
<h2>RPM agnostics</h2>
<p>There is actually two kinds of RPMs. Binary RPM and then there is Source RPM. Source RPM contains everything needed to compile this package again. Source rpm ending is &#8216;.src.rpm&#8217; or &#8216;nosrc.rpm&#8217;. Binary RPM is architecture specific. So if you have &#8216;arm7v.rpm&#8217; it wont run your x86_64 or x86 machine because it&#8217;s ARM7 binary code. There is also noarch.rpm that is architectural non specific.<br />
In openSUSE traditionally if you build RPM it goes to &#8216;/usr/src/packages&#8217; directory and there is sub directories</p>

SOURCES/ - Contains needed sources for building including patches
SRPMS/ - Where Source RPMS are placed after build
BUILDROOT/ - This is ROOT place where make install places installed files (because you don't want them to go real root dir) 
RPMS/ - All the RPMs are placed here (It contains i686, x86_64 and noarch subdirs where those arch files are placed)
SPECS/ - Where .spec files are placed
</pre>
<p>So if you build i686 RPM with your x86 openSUSE then it would go to &#8216;/usr/src/packages/RPMS/i686&#8242; directory and Source RPM &#8216;/usr/src/packages/SRPMS&#8217; directory.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Now you should <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/11/19/opensuse-and-gcc-part-7/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 7: autotools and how I do it">read Part 7</a> and <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/11/12/opensuse-and-gcc-part-6/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 6: Introduction to autotools">part 6</a> of this series to have example application and autotools installed. then we install rpm-build</p>
<pre>
zypper install rpm-build
</pre>
<p>and make distribution tar-ball of sdl_displaybitmap with</p>
<pre>
make dist
</pre>
<p>there should be  &#8216;sdl_displaybitmap-1.0.tar.bz2&#8242; file now in same directory. then copy this SPEC file to file named &#8216;sdl_displaybitmap.spec&#8217; in same directory you have &#8216;sdl_displaybitmap-1.0.tar.bz2&#8242;</p>

</pre>
<p>and copy our tar-ball to &#8216;/usr/src/packages/SOURCES&#8217;. After that we build rpmbuild command to create RPM packages</p>
<pre>
rpmbuild -ba sdl_displaybitmap.spec
</pre>
<p>If everything goes right you should have this RPM in &#8216;/usr/src/packages/RPMS/YOURARCHHERE/sdl_displaybitmap-1.0-1.YOURARCHHERE.rpm&#8217; and SRPM in &#8216;/usr/src/packages/SRPMS/sdl_displaybitmap-1.0-1.src.rpm&#8217;. You can check with less that what files it contains</p>
<pre>
less /usr/src/packages/RPMS/YOURARCHHERE/sdl_displaybitmap-1.0-1.YOURARCHHERE.rpm
</pre>
<p><strong>OBS</strong> If you install this RPM it won&#8217;t work! Application only works if you go to folder &#8216;/usr/share/sdl_displaybitmap&#8217; and run it there. Next time we patch our app to work from other places also.</p>
<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
<p>There is better documentation <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package#Creating_a_SPEC_file" title="Creating a SPEC file">else where than I can write</a>. For openSUSE conventions see <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Packaging" title="Portal:Packaging">Packaging in Wiki</a>. If you curious read it from there and learn. Next time we make OBS (openSUSE Build Service) build from this RPM and last part is how we use OBS to create also Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora packages from our marvelous app.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Welcome to Central Industrial, &#8220;We are the future&#8221;&#8216; is a quote from Blade Runner and now we are entering at last to future with anual <a href="http://www.eu-robotics.net/eurobotics-week/" title="European Robotics Week " target="_blank">European Robotics Week</a>. When Blade Runner world is just around the corner it&#8217;s time to reveal small Robotics pet project with openSUSE and <a href="http://opencv.org/" title="OpenCV">OpenCV</a>.<span id="more-10181"></span></p>
<h2>Starting project</h2>
<p>After reading articles <a href="http://www.einfach-cnc.de/bf20_cnc-umbau.html" title="BF20 CNC-Umbau">like this</a> and <a href="http://www.students.tut.fi/~kontkant/bf20.php.html" title="Optimum BF20 Vario CNC conversion">this</a> I&#8217;ve get idea to turn our mill also to CNC-machine. You can read from those good articles how to make it.They&#8217;ll tell it better than me. If you don&#8217;t read Germany I can let you know neater do I.<br />
I&#8217;ve just took <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno" title="Arduino Uno">Arduino Uno</a> (That was laying around in office), <a href="https://www.synthetos.com/project/grblshield/" title="The Arduino grblShield">grblShield</a> and couple of <a href="http://www.trinamic.com/" title="Trinamic">Trinamic NEMA-17 stepper motor</a> (Not cheapest but they work ok with grblShield). So I was ready to rock.</p>
<h2>Loooooong IDLE</h2>
<p>Then I&#8217;ve take</p>
<pre>
WHILE(1)
  IF HAVE_TIME != YES THEN
    PRINT "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"
    SLEEP MONTH
  ELSE
    PRINT "Hello Doctor Falken, Do you want to play?"
    BREAK
  FI
ELIHW</pre>
<p>Long IDLE and then I  had little spare time so I started project and formulated CNC machine. It&#8217;s not as beautiful as those examples but it works good and it&#8217;s very accurate.</p>
<h2>CNC machine ain&#8217;t robot</h2>
<p>You are correct I just kind of robot. It does what GRBL (G-Code) says but it doesn&#8217;t function by itself. So next when I have more free R&amp;D slots I&#8217;ll take webcam and OpenCV and start converting it to real robot that can function without me.</p>
<h2>But but you didn&#8217;t tell how to get GRBL into Arduino UNO</h2>
<p>Okay I&#8217;ll share this with you and just with you. Download HEX file <a href="https://github.com/grbl/grbl" title="GRBL">from https://github.com/grbl/grbl</a>. Then download Arduino RPMs and avr-dude from <a href="http://build.opensuse.org" title="OBS">http://build.opensuse.org</a>. You got to be on dialout-group in openSUSE to do this (Tune it from YaST2 groups &amp; users position and re-login to it take effect). If you don&#8217;t have any other ACM (probably Modem or GPS device) devices in you machine you device location is probably &#8216;<em>/dev/ttyACM0</em>&#8216; and you also have to know which arduino programming version you have (Mine is <strong>1.0.5</strong>). After that HEX goes in and Arduino blinks light and your robot is alive..</p>
<pre>
avrdude -C/usr/share/arduino-1.0.5/hardware/tools/avrdude.conf -pm328p -carduino -P/your/ACM/device/here -D -U flash:w:your_grbl_hex_here.hex</pre>
<p>Now is time to listen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXa9tXcMhXQ" title="We are the robots">Kraftwerks: We are the robots</a> for few times..</p>
