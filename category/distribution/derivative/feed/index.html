				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have not been actively participating in openSUSE project for some time now, as a result there has not been much to blog about on <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/author/cyberorg">openSUSE Lizards blog</a>, there is a new blog at <a href="https://cyberorg.wordpress.com">https://cyberorg.wordpress.com</a> to blog about what I have been and will be up to with Li-f-e: Linux for Education project among other things. I am also now &#8220;<a href="https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2016-03/msg00036.html">Member Emeritus</a>&#8221; of the openSUSE community due to lack of participation, so cyberorg@opensuse.org email address will no longer work, please use @cyberorg.info if you need to get in touch with me.</p>
<p>After almost a decade of bringing you Li-f-e: Linux for Education based on openSUSE, it is now based on Ubuntu MATE LTS releases. I hope to provide the same excellent user experience that you have come to expect. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberorg-home/files/Li-f-e/">Download it from here</a>. Reason for this change is mentioned in <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/07/04/future-of-li-f-e-linux-for-education-distribution/">previous post</a> and it&#8217;s discussion(lack of interest/time/skills by anyone for maintaining live installer). You can of course easily enable Education Build Service repository to install packages on standard openSUSE or use <a href="https://susestudio.com/">susestudio</a> to create your own spin with Education packages.</p>
<p>To new beginnings&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have come a long way since the first Li-f-e live media based on openSUSE was created, the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e" target="_blank">current release</a> is based on <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:42.1" target="_blank">openSUSE Leap 42.1</a>. <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2015/05/27/indonesia-uses-linux-opensuse-for-pilot-project/" target="_blank">Deployments by Indonesia&#8217;s</a> education system is a shining example of <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Education">openSUSE Education</a> project&#8217;s accomplishment.</p>
<p>The openSUSE project has stopped producing live medias for Leap and also live-installer is dropped from live medias created for the Tumbleweed distribution. As Li-f-e is primarily a live distribution we would not be able to create any more medias without live-installer. So unless this situation changes we may not have Li-f-e based on Leap 42.2.</p>
<p>In the meantime I&#8217;ve had a look at <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> to create Li-f-e based on the latest LTS release of <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/" target="_blank">Ubuntu-Mate</a>, check it out <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberorg-home/files/Li-f-e/" target="_blank">here</a>. Software selection available is kept identical to the Li-f-e based on openSUSE, however there is always a room for improvement, suggestions to enhance it are always welcome.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some time back I wrote a patch to KIWI that allows running openSUSE live entirely from RAM(tmpfs).<br />
<span id="more-11671"></span></p>
<p>How to use it?<br />
Pass &#8220;toram&#8221; parameter at the boot menu. Try it on <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">Li-f-e</a>.</p>
<p>Benefits:<br />
Running the OS from RAM make it lot more responsive than running from DVD or USB device, for example it is most useful for running a demo computer where many users try lot of applications installed in the live system. USB or the DVD can be ejected once the OS is loaded. It can be used to load OS to RAM directly from iso in a virtual machine as well.</p>
<p>Caveat:<br />
Needs enough RAM to copy the entire iso to RAM and then some spare to operate the OS, Li-f-e for instance would need minimum 5G RAM available. It also takes a bit longer to boot as the entire image is copied to RAM.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier tool <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2012/09/13/live-fat-stick/">live-fat-stick</a> uses syslinux to create multiboot USB stick/hdd on a vfat parition without having to format the stick preserving existing data and copying whole ISO so the same stick can serve as demo as well as to copy ISOs for distributing. However the disadvantages are all of them that comes from using vfat.</p>
<p>Grub2 has come a long way and almost all major distributions now support booting from the iso image via loopback. So here is <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/live-grub-stick">live-grub-stick</a> script that uses grub in place of syslinux bringing in all the advantages of using grub2.</p>
<p>Currently live images of openSUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora and all their clones are supported. Go ahead and <a href="https://github.com/cyberorg/live-fat-stick">fork it</a> if you would like to add support for your distribution.</p>

This effectively makes it the only enterprise grade long term supported(LTS) distribution for Education.</p>
<p>As with previous releases <a href="http://download.opensuse-education.org/~cyberorg/opensuse-edu-life-4211-packages.txt">we have bundled a ton of softwares</a> on this <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick">live DVD/USB</a> specially packaged for education, along with the Plasma, GNOME and Mate Desktop Environments, full multimedia experience is also provided out of the box thanks to the Packman repositories. Only x86_64 architecture is supported, if you have a lot of machines that only support x86 then read on to find out how you can extend their Li-f-e.<br />
<span id="more-11596"></span></p>
<p>You can of course very <a href="http://cyberorg.github.io/kiwi-ltsp-howto/">easily turn Li-f-e to full-fledged LTSP server</a> to PXE boot machines in your local network. Booting both i686 and x86_64 architectures is supported. In case you need to PXE boot machines below i686 then you would have to <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/kiwi-ltsp-tinycore-tc">install this package</a>.</p>
<p>Happy holidays!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following up from my earlier post about <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2014/12/16/ltsp-client-goes-banana-pi/">openSUSE LTSP on Banana Pi</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102091635847832058268">Nora Lee</a> from the manufacturer of the board got in touch with me and sent me a couple of their new boards- <a href="http://www.bananapi.com/index.php/component/content/article?layout=edit&amp;id=73">Banana Pi M2,</a> runs on A31s quad-core CPU and has 1G RAM, powerful enough to run openSUSE Tumbleweed with Xfce Desktop.</p>
<p>Here is how you can get openSUSE running on Banana Pi M2.</p>
<p>* <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberorg-home/files/opensuse-arm/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.tar.xz/download">Download the image</a></p>
<p>* Extract the archive to get openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.img</p>
<p>* Dump openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.img on to a SD card<br />
(dd if=/path/to/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M; sync #replace /dev/sdX with your actual SD card device)</p>
<p>*  In case you have a bigger SD card, use yast2 disk(partitioner) to &#8220;expand&#8221; the second partition. You can use yast’s package manager to install more software. The default password for root is <strong>linux</strong>, you may want to change that first thing after booting.</p>
<p>I am unable to get sound on this hardware, probably <a href="https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-Mainline-bsp">their kernel</a> is missing sound related modules, if you figure out how to get sound working drop me a line so I can include it in next release.Everything else(wifi, hdmi out, USB ports etc) works well enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is a credit-card sized computer running ARM processor that plugs into your TV/PC monitor, mouse and a keyboard, it is capable of running Linux and can be made to do many interesting things.The <a href="http://www.bananapi.org/">Banana Pi </a>is a what Chinese ingeniousness came up with after they checked out Raspberry Pi, they made a lot more powerful knockoff. This is a &#8220;How-to&#8221; use Banana Pi as <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI-LTSP">LTSP</a> client. <span id="more-11121"></span></p>
<p>There is <a href="http://www.berryterminal.com/">BerryTerminal</a> project which makes it possible to use Raspberry Pi as <a href="http://ltsp.org">LTSP</a> Thin Client, on the server you can run any distribution that can run LTSP server, it can be running CPU with x86/x86_64/whatever architecture as LTSP provides a way to run X session from the server via SSH tunnel. Biggest benefit of running LTSP is centralized user and data management, and clients can be of modest specification as all clients&#8217; sessions are run on the server. This is a drawback as well, as the server needs to be powerful enough to handle many sessions. This is where LTSP Fat Client help, it allows running of users&#8217; session on the client that are powerful enough, while users and data are stored on the central server allowing modest server to serve many more clients than it would otherwise. Raspberry Pi is not that capable to run full featured Linux desktop, Banana Pi with it&#8217;s dual core CPU and 1 GB RAM is just good enough to work as a Thin Client as well as a Fat Client. perfect for home, small office or school lab.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://www.lemaker.org/resources/9-101/opensuse_for_bananapi.html">openSUSE 13.1 available for Banana Pi</a>, it comes with XFCE desktop and many useful software pre-installed. Because I do not know how to create images for this hardware, that image is used as a base for Banana Terminal. Here are the steps to turn your Banana Pi into LTSP client.</p>
<p>* Download <a class="name" title="Click to download openSUSE-Bananapi-LTSP.tar.xz" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberorg-home/files/opensuse-arm/openSUSE-Bananapi-LTSP.tar.xz/download">openSUSE-Bananapi-LTSP.tar.xz</a></p>
<p>* Extract the archive to get openSUSE-Bananapi-LTSP.img from it.</p>
<p>* Dump the openSUSE-Bananapi-LTSP.img on to a SD card, <a href="http://www.lemaker.org/resources/9-39/banana_pi_quick_start_guide.html">see step 5 here</a>.</p>
<p>* Change settings according to your network configuration</p>
<p>In the second partition of SD card etc/lts.conf edit the SERVER variable to point to LTSP server in your network.</p>
<p>* Plug the SD card in your Banana Pi and boot it up, make sure the network is connected and LTSP server is <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:LTSP_quick_start_12.2_Edu">set up properly</a>. You have to create users on the server to use for login on client.</p>
<p>*  In case you have a bigger SD card, use yast2 disk(partitioner) on the client to expand the second partition. You can use yast&#8217;s package manager to install more software. The default password for root is bananapi, you may want to change that first thing after booting.</p>
<p>If you would like to run LTSP client on <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Category:ARM_devices">ARM7 hardware supported by openSUSE</a> I would be happy to accept hardware donation to get it working <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Have a lot of fun&#8230;</p>
