				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.muktware.com/2013/12/nvidia-drivers-now-available-opensuse-13-1/17381"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Nvidia-300x168.jpg" alt="Nvidia pic from Muktware" width="300" height="168" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10405" /></a><br />
The NVIDIA drivers for openSUSE 13.1 took a while to appear. Many users have asked why this was and we&#8217;d like to explain what happened and what we plan to do to prevent this in the future. This post was written with input from the openSUSE developers who maintain these drivers at SUSE and work with NVIDIA to make them available for our users.</p>
<h2>How it should work</h2>
<p>Legally, the Linux kernel GPLv2 license leaves proprietary binary drivers in a bit of a tangle. While some claim it should be OK, others say not &#8211; and that is what most distributions currently assume: one can not ship a Linux distribution with proprietary, binary drivers. NVIDIA has agreed that our users can grab their drivers from the official NVIDIA servers. They are packaged by SUSE engineers however. They take care of both SLE and openSUSE proprietary driver packaging for NVIDIA hardware, and have contacts at NVIDIA who get the drivers up on their ftp mirrors.<br />
<a href="http://opensuse-community.org/nvidia.ymp"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Nvidia-1click.png" alt="Nvidia-1click" width="160" height="40" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10406" /></a><br />
The packages are build on a dedicated system, but the package spec (skeleton for building) is in OBS &#8211; for example, <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/X11:Drivers:Video/nvidia-gfxG03">G03 is here</a>. Anybody could use these to build the nvidia driver locally (the nvidia binary driver is grabbed from the nvidia driver during building). The command sequence for local building can be found in <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/X11:Drivers:Video/nvidia-gfxG03/README?expand=1">the README</a>.</p>
<p>Once the packages are build, they are send to NVIDIA, which signs the packages with their key and generates and signs repositories, making them available to the public.</p>
<p>To note is the fact that this is all manual and takes a while on NVIDIA&#8217;s side (and ours). This of course is part of the reason why we don&#8217;t offer NVIDIA packages for Factory, our fast-rolling development repository.</p>
<h2>What happened</h2>
<p>What occurred for 13.1 is a typical case of &#8220;everything went wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>Up until a few weeks before the release, the driver did not build against the Linux Kernel version 3.11. NVIDIA warned against the use of a patch for this problem created by third parties so the driver team did not have a running build. Due to a holiday, it took a while to get the packages build and pushed to NVIDIA. Unfortunately, by the time this was done, the holiday period at NVIDIA blocked progress for another week. Once the package was signed, it took the webteam at NVIDIA another week to get the repository published. It all added up to almost a month and brought quite some inconvenience for users eager to use their latest NVIDIA cards with the latest openSUSE.</p>
<p>About a week later, the openSUSE 13.1 NVIDIA drivers disappeared again from the nvidia servers for a day or so. We don&#8217;t know exactly what happened there, it might have simply been a server issue.</p>
<h2>What we will do</h2>
<p>The first and  most obvious thing to change would be to improve coordination. The developers taking care of the NVIDIA packages should be made aware as early as possible about the release planning and a replacement in case for holidays should be available. We noted this in our 13.1 release report and will make sure that there will be a <a href="http://progress.opensuse.org">task in our task tracker</a> for this for the next release. We also need to talk to NVIDIA about this to make sure that there, too, somebody can fill in for SUSE&#8217;s contacts.</p>
<p>But there are also thoughts on how to improve further. Some of the current ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>To get drivers for Factory the process needs more automation as the driver may break on kernel or X changes</li>
<li>We could try to open the process and work with community members to secure the process in case the SUSE folks are unavailalbe</li>
<li>It would be nice if we could make NVidia to see benefit of working more on the driver in openSUSE, e.g. by doing some testing</li>
<li>We could write some scripts that check regularly whether repo and packages are still available and in a valid state (meta data matches available RPMs)</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to see which of these we can implement, when and how. But rest assured that we will do what we can to prevent this in the future!</p>

<h2>And the stats!</h2>
<p>After a bit of a hiatus, we&#8217;re back with the numbers. Development has slowed down around new year and isn&#8217;t back to speed yet so the 10th spot is shared by quite a big group of people&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, the openSUSE team blog is written by Agustin, talking about the proposals the team has done for openSUSE development.</p>
<p>A few months ago the openSUSE Team started a journey that achieved an important milestone last Tuesday, Nov 26th 2013. We have worked on creating a picture of relevant areas of the project in 2016 together with some of the actions we think should be taken during the following months to achieve it. To stop working and raise your head once in a while to analyze what is around you and setting a direction is a very good exercise.</p>
<h2>The process we followed</h2>
<p>The first step was working on data mining. After many hours of analysis, we identified some clear trends that helped us to establish a solid starting point to begin to work with. Once that phase was over (this is an ongoing process, in fact), we worked for a few weeks/months in trying to define that future picture interviewing several dozens of people. We refined that first attempt through several iterations, including many of those who participated in the original round and others who didn&#8217;t. Susanne Oberhauser-Hirschoff was the person who drove that process with Agustin.</p>
<p>We soon realized that discussing high level ideas in a community used to &#8220;Get shit done&#8221; was going to be easier if we complement them with some more down to earth proposals, specially in technical aspects. We cannot forget that, after all, openSUSE is a technical (and very pragmatic) focused community.</p>
<p>So, in parallel with the already mentioned refinement of the big picture, we started discussing within the team the actions needed to take to make the big picture a reality, the openSUSE development version a.k.a Enhanced/New Factory. After many hours of (sometimes never ending) discussions, we agreed on the ideas we are currently being published, together with the motivations behind them.</p>
<p>Another aspect we tried to bring to the discussion has been a strong dose of realism, trying to ensure that whatever we came up to was compatible with the nature of the project. We have also put focus on making sure that the initial proposal is achievable. So as part of community, we understand very well we cannot succeed alone. We need to work with you. So we just opened with the community a process analogous to what we went through within the team. It might be different in form but similar in principles and goals.</p>
<h2>What are we going through these days?</h2>
<p>These days the proposals are being discussed in different mailing lists. We are collecting feedback, discussing it, summarizing it, adapting the proposal to it &#8230; trying to reach agreements before defining what to do next.</p>
<h2>What the proposal looks like?</h2>
<p>We divided the proposal in a series of smaller proposals we are publishing in the project mailing list, where the general community topics in openSUSE are discussed, and/or factory ML, where the more technical discussions take place.</p>

Stephan Kulow summarizes the Action Plan for the first aspect pointed in the previous picture: the new Development process (Factory).</li>
</ol>
<p>The following articles describe in more detail some relevant (also new) elements pointed in the previous article, since they are new or modify the current process significantly. Some of the articles are in the queue to be published.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2013-12/msg00044.html">One of the options for staging projects</a><br />
In this mail Michal Hrusecky provides some details and examples on how the new staging projects might work in the future.</li>
<li><a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2013-12/msg00132.html">openQA in the new proposal</a><br />
This text, written by Ludwig Nussel, explains the principles that should drive the inclusion of openQA in the Factory development process, according with the proposed workflow.</li>
<li><a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2013-12/msg00147.html">Karma for all</a><br />
This mail, written by Ancor González, summarizes our ideas to include a social feature in the process to help achieving Factory goals.</li>
<li><a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2013-12/msg00318.html">Policies, or why it&#8217;s good to know how to change things</a><br />
The new process needs to be adaptive. Antonio Larrosa proposed a way, taking what other projects do in this regard as reference.</li>
</ol>
<p>There might be an eighth article describing some smaller, still relevant, ideas. After publishing the &#8220;content&#8221;, we will release one last article providing a information about how to achieve these ideas, describing also our compromise in terms of effort and pointing out the challenges we perceive in the plan from the execution point of view.</p>
<p>We would like to invite you to the debate if you haven&#8217;t raised your opinions yet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Only for the brave, Proprietary AMD/ATI Catalyst fglrx 13.10 BETA2 (13.20.11-1) rpm released</h1>
<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above. And adventurous users who know how to deal with troubles.<br />
The majority could easily wait the final release, expected somewhat later even if it take a long time <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
</p>
<p>This is experimental &amp; BETA software, it could fix issues you encountered, but also can eat your kittens. You&#8217;ve been warned !<br />
flgrx build for 3.11 series kernel ( Tumbleweed &amp; 13.1 ).<br />
But this time I&#8217;ve to update the Sebastian script myself, so I consider also the package as beta stage.
</p>
<h3>Installing the new repository</h3>
<p>Admitting you&#8217;ve the normal repository named FGLRX, (use zypper lr -d to find the number or name you give it). You have to start by disabling it<br />
so you could fallback to it quickly. Open a root console or add sudo at your convenience and issue the following command:</p>
<pre>zypper mr -dR FGLRX</pre>
<p>The beta driver is available for 11.4 (evergreen kernel), 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 13.1, Tumbleweed (12.3 based + kernel 3.11) at <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fgrlx-beta/">amd-fglrx-beta</a></p>
<p>To add another repository in the same console as root issue the following command which will install normally the right repository for your distribution</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_`lsb-release -r | awk '{print $2}'` FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p><b>If you are using Tumbleweed</b> use this one</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_Tumbleweed FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Now the update/upgrade process</p>
<pre>zypper dup -r FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Let the system upgrade the package, and try to enjoy the new beta</p>
<p><span id="more-9973"></span></p>
<h2>Release note about 13.10 BETA2 and new repository</h2>
<p>
This BETA Catalyst fglrx version support openSUSE version from 11.4 to 13.1 (new repository) and also Tumbleweed (thus also kernel 3.11x series).<br />
<br />
We create a new repository, to avoid any mix between stable and beta. If you want to try it, you will have to disable the amd-fglrx, and install the<br />
new repository. Also the signer of package have change and use now the generic builder gpg key at Ioda-Net. (gpg key id 65BE584C)
</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>update:</strong> new image with kernel-3.6 and minimal X11/icewm http://www.zq1.de/~bernhard/linux/opensuse/raspberrypi-opensuse-20130911x.img.xz (103MB)</p></blockquote>
<p>We got a new armv6 based image for the Raspberry Pi.<br />
This one is only 82MB compressed, so pretty minimalistic.</p>
<p>http://www.zq1.de/~bernhard/linux/opensuse/raspberrypi-opensuse-20130907.img.xz</p>
<p>The exciting new thing is that this was created using an alternative image building automatism which I wrote from scratch in three hours this morning.<br />
The scripts can be found at</p>
<p>https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:ARM:Factory:Contrib:RaspberryPi/altimagebuild</p>
<p>and are also embedded within the image under /home/abuild/rpmbuild/SOURCES/</p>
<p>This means that everyone can now easily build his own images the way he likes and even branch and do submit requests for changes that are useful for others.<br />
The way to use this is simple.<br />
If you have 6GB RAM, you can speed things up with export OSC_BUILD_ROOT=/dev/shm/arm before you do<br />
<code>osc co devel:ARM:Factory:Contrib:RaspberryPi altimagebuild<br />
cd devel:ARM:Factory:Contrib:RaspberryPi/altimagebuild<br />
bash -x main.sh<br />
</code></p>
<p>This pseudo-package does not easily build within OBS or osc alone because it needs root permissions for some of the steps (chroot, mknod, mount), which could only be workarounded with User-Mode-Linux or patching osc.<br />
The build consists of three steps that can be seen in main.sh:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, osc build is used to pull in required packages and setup the armv6 rootfs.</li>
<li>Second, mkrootfs.sh modifies a copy of the rootfs under .root to contain all required configs</li>
<li>And finally, mkimage.sh takes the .root dir and creates a .img from it that can be booted</li>
</ol>
<p>This can build an image from scatch in three minutes. And my Raspberry Pi booted successfully with it within 55 seconds.</p>
<p>There are some remaining open issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>the repo key is initially untrusted</li>
<li><del datetime="2013-09-11T09:01:03+00:00">still uses old 3.1 kernel</del> &#8211; solved</li>
<li>build scripts have no error handling</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to the old image, this one has some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easier to resize because the root partition is the last one</li>
<li>Compressed image is much smaller</li>
<li>Reproducible image build, so easy to customize</li>
<li>It is armv6 with floating point support, so could be faster</li>
<li>We have over 5200 successfully built packages from <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/ports/armv6hl/factory/repo/oss/">openSUSE:Factory:ARM</a><br />
so for example you can install a minimalistic graphical environment with <code>zypper install xauth twm xorg-x11-server xinit</code> and start it with <code>startx</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you wanted to play with openSUSE on RPi, you can do so right now and have a lot of fun.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shortly before the openSUSE Conference, we featured <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2013/07/04/numbers-is-opensuse/">a post about openSUSE statistics</a>. It mostly talked about where we got the numbers, teasing that we&#8217;d share the details at the openSUSE Conference. And <a href="https://conference.opensuse.org/osem/conference/osc2013/proposal/62">Alberto did</a>. Today we&#8217;ll bring you the numbers Alberto did digested in images and text.</p>
<h2>Downloads and users</h2>
<p>The simplest statistics for a Linux distribution are of course the numbers of downloads and users, so let&#8217;s start there.</p>
<h3>ISO downloads</h3>
<p>The methodology used to count downloads is easy to understand: we count every IP address that hit the server or is redirected to one of the mirrors, and express the intention to start downloading one of the ISO images available for the distribution. In this way, we count independently every download that uses the same proxy and every different product downloaded by the same IP. We can group the downloads by weeks or by month. In both images we can see that we started counting in 2010 and we covered openSUSE 11.0 to 12.3. Also, in both graphs we can see what events explain the peaks, like the release of the distribution.</p>
<div id="attachment_9782" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/download_month.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/download_month-300x177.png" alt="Downloads per month" width="300" height="177" class="size-medium wp-image-9782" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Downloads per month</p></div>
<div id="attachment_9781" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/download_week.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/download_week-300x177.png" alt="Downloads per week" width="300" height="177" class="size-medium wp-image-9781" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Downloads per week</p></div>
<p>To make a more detailed analysis we need to concentrate on the monthly graph. For this plot we calculated a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression">linear regression model</a> using the monthly data (41 samples). In the graph you can see a slight growth but decreasing impact of releases. Extrapolating, we can expect about 560K downloads per month in 2014. Note that this is downloads, not installs! Let&#8217;s talk about those next.</p>
<h2>Installations</h2>
<p>To get a more reliable estimation of persistent installations we count systems that regularly update. A count of the encountered unique systems per week or per month is a fair estimator of the number of active installations (<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Statistics#Note_about_the_Privacy">see details on the counting</a>).<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/uuid_month.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/uuid_month-1024x607.png" alt="updates per month" width="700" height="415" class="size-large wp-image-9776" /></a></p>
<div id="attachment_9775" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/uuid_week.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/uuid_week-300x177.png" alt="updates per week" width="300" height="177" class="size-medium wp-image-9775" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Updates per week</p></div>
<p>Here you see many interesting things. For example, the red trace on top of the plot in 2010 and 2011 are Factory users. If you look closely, you also see that usage of a particular version already starts before it is out &#8211; that is due to testers checking out milestones, Beta and RC versions. And you notice how long it takes some users to move over to new versions of openSUSE &#8211; not only has over half of our users not moved to the latest 12.3 yet, but about 140.000 users happily still run releases from before 12.2, most of which (<a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Evergreen">except 11.4</a>) receive no security updates!</p>
<p>When we plot a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression">linear regression model</a> on this data, we see a less encouraging picture compared to the downloads: on average, we lose around 300 users per month. On the size of our installed base this is not huge, but worrying nonetheless.</p>
<h3>More data</h3>
<p>There are more things that we can learn from the data. We can analyze the behavior of users according to the installation medium or the architecture used and in time we can perhaps analyse how repositories are used and which are popular.</p>
<div id="attachment_9780" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/medium_arch_week.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/medium_arch_week-1024x607.png" alt="Medium and Architecture per week" width="700" height="415" class="size-large wp-image-9780" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Medium and Architecture per week</p></div>
<h2>The Open Build Service</h2>
<p>The Open Build Service is what openSUSE uses to build and distribute packages. It is a very integral part of our infrastructure and how we work, and its server logs contain a wealth of information on the work done on openSUSE. For example, mining the list of Submit Requests that go into Factory and devel projects, we created the graph below to give an idea of the development of the number of contributors working on openSUSE, with the total (blue) per month going nicely up as you can see.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/obs_data_crop.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/obs_data_crop.png" alt="OBS Contributor Data" width="700" height="438" class="size-full wp-image-9799" /></a></p>
<h2>Social media</h2>
<p>Thanks to the help of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZJP4qJnAuo">Athanasios-Ilias Rousinopoulos</a> (that is a link to his presentation at oSC13) we&#8217;re regularly gathering statistics on our social media, a summary you can see in the graph below. Yes, we&#8217;re doing well getting our message to people, thank you all for your part in that!</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/social_data.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/social_data-1024x607.png" alt="social media data" width="700" height="415" class="size-large wp-image-9777" /></a></p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s compare: openSUSE vs. Fedora</h2>
<p>Numbers are useless if you can&#8217;t compare. We searched for data from other distributions like Ubuntu, Gentoo, Arch or Debian, but only Fedora provides real numbers with <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Statistics">the methodology used to generate them</a>. Kudos to our friends at Fedora for being open and transparent!</p>
<p>Now, they use a different way of gathering data on downloads: counting the number of different IPs seen per day. To count users, they count the number of different IPs seen for this release since the release date. This complicated matters on our side but we&#8217;ve made it work. However, one variable was a bit harder: both distributions have different release cycles and dates. As you see in the graphs, we tried our best to make the comparison as direct as possible. The plots below are in the same scale of time and number of downloads.</p>
<div id="attachment_9778" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/opensuse_fedora_users.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/opensuse_fedora_users-300x177.png" alt="openSUSE and Fedora Users" width="300" height="177" class="size-medium wp-image-9778" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">openSUSE and Fedora Users</p></div>
<div id="attachment_9779" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/opensuse_fedora_downloads.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/opensuse_fedora_downloads-300x177.png" alt="openSUSE and Fedora Downloads" width="300" height="177" class="size-medium wp-image-9779" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">openSUSE and Fedora Downloads</p></div>
<p>As you can see, Fedora has more downloads than openSUSE. Looking at the users, the situation is reverse: openSUSE has quite a bit more users than Fedora according to this measurement. How is this possible? The explanation is most likely that most openSUSE users upgrade with a &#8216;zypper dup&#8217; command to the new releases, while Fedora users tend to do a fresh installation. Note that, like everybody else, we&#8217;re very much aware of the deceptive nature of statistics: there is always room for mistakes in the analysis of data. To at least provide a way to detect errors and follow the commendable example set by Fedora, here are <a href="https://github.com/aplanas/opensuse-data">our data analysis scripts in github</a>.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/statistics-dister-inside-close-up.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/statistics-dister-inside-close-up-282x300.png" alt="statistics dister inside close-up" width="282" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9628" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above. And adventurous users who know how to deal with troubles.<br />
The majority could easily wait the final release, expected somewhat later.
</p>
<p>This is experimental &amp; BETA sofware, it could fix issues you encountered, but also can eat your kitten. You&#8217;ve been warned !<br />
But good reports have been collected around, especially with never 3.10x kernel series.
</p>
<h3>Installing the new repository</h3>
<p>Admitting you&#8217;ve the normal repository named FGLRX, (use zypper lr -d to find the number or name you give it). You have to start by disabling it, so you could fallback to it quickly. Open a root console or add sudo at your convenience and issue the following command:</p>
<pre>zypper mr -dR FGLRX</pre>
<p>The beta driver is available for 11.4 (evergreen kernel), 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 13.1, Tumbleweed (12.3 based + kernel 3.10) at <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/amd-fgrlx-beta/">amd-fglrx-beta</a></p>
<p>To add another repository in the same console as root issue the following command which will install normally the right repository for your distribution</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_`lsb-release -r | awk '{print $2}'` FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p><b>If you are using Tumbleweed</b> use this one</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_Tumbleweed FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Now the update/upgrade process</p>
<pre>zypper dup -r FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Let the system upgrade the package, and try to enjoy the new beta</p>
<p><span id="more-9757"></span></p>
<h2>Release note about 13.8 BETA1 and new repository</h2>
<p>
This BETA Catalyst fglrx version support openSUSE version from 11.4 to 13.1 (new repository) and also Tumbleweed (thus also kernel 3.10x series).<br />
<br />
We create a new repository, to avoid any mix between stable and beta. If you want to try it, you will have to disable the amd-fglrx, and install the<br />
new repository. Also the signer of package have change and use now the generic builder gpg key at Ioda-Net. (gpg key id 65BE584C)

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Michal Hrušecký</em> has been helping out on maintaining Factory in shape and shares his experiences.</p>
<p>Factory is development version of openSUSE and it is where the next openSUSE is taking form. Hundreds of packagers send packages into Factory to be integrated as a part of the new release and many more use Factory for testing or for their daily work. Thus it is really important to keep Factory rolling and usable. Everybody knows that <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2007/08/09/people-of-opensuse-stephan-kulow/">Coolo</a> is the Factory master and he does everything to make next openSUSE be the best ever. But keeping factory in shape is really complicated and stressing task. There are dozens of request everyday and each one of them can potentially break something. So Factory can always use a pair of extra hands and for some time I have been one of them. I&#8217;d like to give you some insight in what we do, working on keeping Factory building and working.<span id="more-9497"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://openbuildservice.org"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9543" alt="obs-logo" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/obs-logo.png" width="243" height="101" /></a></p>
<h2>Keep it building</h2>
<p>With a constant influx of newer and cooler versions of libraries and tools it is easy to break existing applications with shiny new software. So we always have some build failures in Factory. Part of our job is to resolve them because if it doesn&#8217;t build, you can&#8217;t test nor ship it. As developer, you may have seen submit request in various projects in OBS fixing builds for Factory. Everyday I take a look at a number of build failures, investigate why they are not building in Factory and try to do something about it.</p>
<p>For example new version of the GNU C Compiler (GCC) is quite often more strict on includes, requiring developers to be more verbose about the exact internal and external libraries there applications require to be build. What used to build now doesn&#8217;t, because you are missing include files. The older GCC let you slip by, but now you have to fix it, build failure by build failure. Another example is GTK which keeps deprecating old API functions and you have to keep up and replace them with correct counterparts from the new API. Sometimes even the kernel changes API and third party modules stops building. All these errors will get eventually resolved upstream (if upstream is alive), but as we follow upstream quite closely before feature freeze, it may happen that we are first facing these issues because sometime we are the first ones who tried to compile this software using new GTK or the new GCC. Of course, we attempt to get these fixes back upstream and share them with other distributions where appropriate!</p>

<h2>Test it</h2>
<p>Another important part of working on a better Factory is testing. If everything builds, we&#8217;re happy. You might have heard the saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><em> if it builds, ship it!</em></p></blockquote>
<p>(un)fortunately, this isn&#8217;t Coolo&#8217;s idea of how the world works. In Factory, things not only have to build, but also work. Oh, AND conform to some stringent requirements. Here comes into play what most of our team was working on in the past months and what was <a href="For example new version of gcc is quite often more strict on includes.  What used to build now doesn't, because you are missing include files. Older gcc let you slip by, but now you have to fix it. Or GTK keeps deprecating old API functions and you have to keep up and replace them with correct counterparts from new API. Sometimes even kernel changes API and third party modules stops building. All these errors will get eventually resolved upstream (if upstream is alive), but as we follow upstream quite closely before feature freeze, it may happen that we are first facing these issues because sometime we are the first ones who tried to compile this software using new GTK and gcc.">described last week &#8211; openQA</a>. openQA tests the latest builds of openSUSE Factory, tries to install them and run tests on some applications as well. But still, not all failures from automatic testing are real failures. Sometimes application just changed too much to be covered by test. So from time to time we go through failing openQA tests, try to reproduce them, figure out what went wrong and either fix it or report it via bugzilla to the corresponding maintainer.</p>
<h2>Concluding</h2>
<p>Each of these tasks is relatively small (check why this test failed, fix this package to build with new gcc) but what makes it hard is the number of packages we&#8217;ve got and the constant inflow of changes. Also, because the issue can be all over the place, each and every one requires you to dive into an entirely new package, with new and interesting quirks, build systems, languages and more. It is a great way of getting to know a wide variety of packages and applications, finding a gem every now and then. But also implies a lot of work.</p>
<p>Things will get slower and more stable after feature freeze when we will spend more time in the testing part, while today we mostly work on the build part. Still, Factory has to keep building, without that it becomes impossible to keep developing openSUSE. What we do, fixing these build errors, it might not be super visible, but it matters a lot.</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>On a related note, we&#8217;d like to (re) introduce weekly Factory statistics! It has been a while since we had those, once upon a time courtesy of AJ and Guido. Now, Alberto provides them. Here you go, the top-fifteen contributors to openSUSE Factory last week (from Sunday June 2nd to to Sunday June 9th):<br />

<p>The last 12.3 release was important for the openSUSE team for a number of reasons. One reason is that we wanted to integrate QA (Quality Assurance) into the release process in an early stage. You might remember that this release had UEFI and Secure Boot support coming and everybody had read the scary reports about badly broken machines that can only be fixed replacing the firmware. Obviously openSUSE can&#8217;t allow such things to happen to our user base, so we wanted to do more testing.<span id="more-9440"></span></p>
<h2>Testing is hard</h2>
<p>Testing a distribution seems easy at first sight:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the ISO of the last build and put it on the USB stick</li>
<li>Boot from the USB</li>
<li>Install and test</li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ol>
<div id="attachment_9476" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/factory.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9476 " title="testing in progress!" alt="testing in progress!" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/factory_crop-300x169.png" width="300" height="169" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">testing in progress!</p></div>
<p>But look a bit further and you will see that, actually, only the installation process itself is already a <a title="free dictionary on combinatorial" href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/combinatorial" target="_blank">combinatorial</a> problem. In openSUSE we have different mediums (DVD, KDE and Gnome Live images, NET installation image and the new Rescue image), three official architectures (32 and 64 bits and ARMv7), a bunch of different file systems (Ext3 / Ext4, Btrfs, LVM with or without encryption, etc.), different boot loaders (GRUB 2, LILO, SHIM). <em>Yeah</em>&#8230; Even without doing the math you see that for only this small subset of variables we have hundreds of possible combinations. And this is just the installation process, we are not talking about the various desktops and applications or hardware like network interfaces or graphics cards here.</p>
<h3>And we want continuous testing</h3>
<p>And that is only the final testing round! If we want to be serious about QA and testing, we need to run the full test battery for every build that OBS generate for us, with extra attention to the Milestones, Betas and RC which are scheduled in the release road-map.</p>
<p>We can of course attempt to optimize our testing approach. For example, if I am the maintainer of a package and I sure that my last version is working perfectly in Factory (because I tested it in my system, of course), do I really need to test this application again and again when a new ISO build is released? Unfortunately, we can <em>not</em> take a shortcut here. As Distribution, our job is integration and so we need to test the entire product again for every build. A single change in an external library or in any other package which I depend on can break my package. The interdependencies for a integration project of the size of openSUSE are so intricate that is faster to run the full test again. With this approach we are avoiding regressions in our distribution, important during development. But also a lot of work &#8211; who has time for all this testing?</p>
<h2>OpenQA as a solution</h2>
<p>For us, there&#8217;s no doubt about it: <a href="http://openqa.opensuse.org/">openQA</a> is the correct tool for this. openQA is already used to test certain parts of openSUSE, and has shown itself as a competent tool to test other distributions like Fedora or Debian.</p>
<p>To experiment with openQA, the openSUSE team decided to launch a local implementation of the tool and start feeding it with 12.3 builds. But we soon ran into some limitation in the way we can express desired test outcomes in openQA and we got ideas on how to improve the detection of failed and succeeded tests. We also discovered that some tests in openQA had the bad habit of starting to work in <em>“monkey mode”</em> by simply sending commands and events to the virtual machine without checking if those interaction have expected behavior or not, losing track of the test progress.</p>
<p>openQA has the great benefit of being open source so we can improve its usefulness for testing Factory. Moreover, the original author of openQA, Bernhard M. Wiedemann, is a very talented developer and works for SUSE so upstream is very close to us. So we decided to start hacking!<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/stopwatch.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9448 alignright" alt="stopwatch" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/stopwatch-227x300.png" width="113" height="150" /></a></p>
<h2>openQA work</h2>
<p>After the 12.3 release we decided to spend some quality time improving openQA as a team project. This was managed using the public Chili (a Redmine fork) project management web application. We published all the milestones, tasks, goals and documentation in the <a href="http://board.opensuse.org/projects/openqa-improvement/">&#8220;openQA improvement project&#8221;</a>. The management side of this project perhaps needs a different post, but for now we can say that we tried to develop it as open as possible. Of course you can get the full code from <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/">the openSUSE github account</a>.</p>
<h2>Major changes</h2>
<p>The main architectural changes implemented during our 10 weeks of coding on openQA can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration with openCV</li>
<li>Replacement of PPM graphic file format with PNG</li>
<li>Introduced needles; test with better control of the state</li>
<li>A proper job dispatcher for new test configurations</li>
<li>Better internal scheduler, with snapshots and a way to skip tests</li>
<li>Improvement in the communication between webUI and the virtual machine</li>
</ul>

<h3>openCV brings robust testing</h3>
<p>The tests in openQA need to check what is happening in the virtual (or real) machine to verify results, and the main source of information is the output of the screen. This information is usually a graphical information: we can instruct QEMU (or Vbox) to retry screenshots in a periodic basis. To properly evaluate a test outcome we need to find some kind of information in those pictures, and for that we use the computer vision library openCV.</p>
<p>With this library we can implement different methods to find relevant sections of the image, like buttons, error messages or text. These are then used for the test to get information about the actual environment of the installation process and to find out if the test passed or not. Previously, checksums on the images were used to determine outcomes. This led to many false positives (tests failing too often) due to simple theming and layout changes &#8211; a single pixel changing broke the test. openCV support was introduced earlier by Dominik Heidler to enable testing with noisy analogue VGA capture and we extended the usage of openCV matching to be more versatile, powerful and easier to use (both for test-module-writers and for maintainers).<br />

<h3>Introducing needles</h3>
<p>openQA has been modified to use PNG instead of PPM files to store images to test against, improving performance but also enabling openQA to store certain meta-data within the images. This brings us to the most important improvement in openQA: the introduction of the needle. A needle is an PNG image with some meta-data associated (a JSON document). This meta-data describes one or multiple &#8216;regions of interest&#8217; (RoI) in the original image which can be used by the test to match the current screenshot. For example, if the installation is in the partition manager and we send the expected keystrokes to set Btrfs as our default file system, we can assert that this option is currently set using a needle where the RoI has the correct check box marked. In other words: we create a needle with an area covering the check box. The system will search this area in the current screen to assert that there is, somewhere, a check box with this label correctly marked. And will use openCV to make sure that slight changes in theming or layout will not result in a failed test.</p>
<p>The needle concept is really powerful. When a test uses needles with multiple RoI&#8217;s, the system will try to match every area in the current screenshot, in whatever position. There are areas that can be excluded, and areas that can be processed using an OCR (Tesseract) to extract and match text from them.</p>
<p>Thanks to needles we can now create tests that are always in a known state and they can inform complex decisions about the next step to take. For example, we can have tests that can detect and respond correctly when a sudo prompt appears suddenly, or where an error dialog appears when is not expected. More important, we can detect errors more quickly, aborting the installation process and pointing the developer to the exact error.</p>
<h3>Faster testing with snapshots</h3>

<p>We also implemented a way to create snapshots of the virtual machine status. This is useful if we want to retry some tests, or start the test-set from a specific test. For example, if we are testing the Firefox web browser, we want to avoid all the installation tests, and maybe some of the tests related with other applications. With this snapshot feature, we can load the virtual machine in the state where Firefox can be tested immediately.</p>
<h3>Improved web UI</h3>
<p>The final major area of focus has been on the web interface. We designed a set of dialogs to create and edit needles. Using this editor we can also see why the current tests are failing, comparing the current screenshot with the different expected needles from the tests.</p>
<p>Also, from the web interface we can control the execution of the virtual machine: signaling to stop or continue the execution. This is a feature that is useful when we want to create needles in an interactive way.</p>
<h2>Upstream</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re very happy that Bernhard has helped us, both with work and advice, to get these changes implemented. Several improvements were integrated in the <a href="https://github.com/bmwiedemann/os-autoinst/">current production version of openQA</a> and most of the more invasive ones are part of the V2 branch of openQA. We plan to sit together with Bernhard to see about deploying V2 to <a title="openQA in action" href="http://openqa.opensuse.org/results/" target="_blank">openqa.opensuse.org</a> for testing factory as soon as possible.</p>
<p>There is still work to be done. For example, for full integration testing we need to expand on the current ability which allows to run the tests on real hardware. This will for example allow testing graphics and network cards. Also, writing proper documentation is on the todo list. For those interested in helping out putting openQA to work and keeping the quality of our distribution high, the <a title="openSUSE Conference site" href="http://conference.opensuse.org" target="_blank">openSUSE Conference</a> will feature a workshop on creating tests for Factory.</p>
