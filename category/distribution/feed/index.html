				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally there is some news regarding our public cloud presence and openSUSE 13.1. We now have openSUSE 13.1 images published in Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Windows Azure.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s the announcement, but would make for a rather short blog. Thus, let me talk a bit about how this all works and speculate a bit why we&#8217;ve not been all that good with getting stuff out into the public cloud.</p>
<p>Let me start with the speculation part, i.e. hindrances in getting openSUSE images published. In general to get anything into a public cloud one has to have an account. This implies that you hand over your credit card number to the cloud provider and they charge you for the resources you use. Resources in the public cloud are anything and everything that has something to do with data. Compute resources, i.e. the size of an instance w.r.t. memory and number of CPUs are priced differently. Sending data across the network to and from your instances incurs network charges and of course storing stuff in the cloud is not free either. Thus, while anyone can put an image into the cloud and publish it, this service costs the person money, granted not necessarily a lot, but it is a monthly recurring out of pocket expense.</p>
<p>Then there always appears to be the &#8220;official&#8221; apprehension, meaning if person X publishes an openSUSE image from her/his account what makes it &#8220;official&#8221;. Well first we have the problem that the &#8220;official&#8221; stamp is really just an imaginary hurdle. An image that gets published by me is no more or less &#8220;official&#8221; than any other images. I am after all not the release manager or have any of my fingers in the openSUSE release in any way. I do have access to the SUSE accounts and can publish from there and I guess that makes the images &#8220;official&#8221;. But please do not get any ideas about &#8220;official&#8221; images, they do not exist.</p>
<p>Last but not least there is a technical hurdle. Building images in OBS is not necessarily for the faint of heart. Additionally there is a bunch of other stuff that goes along with cloud images. Once you have one it still has to get into the cloud of choice, which requires tools etc.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s enough speculation as to why or why not it may have taken us a bit longer than others, and just for the record we did have openSUSE 12.1 and openSUSE 12.2 images in Amazon. With that lets talk about what is going on.</p>
<p>We have a project in OBS now, actually it has been there for a while, <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Cloud:Images" title="Cloud:Images">Cloud:Images</a> that is intended to be used to build openSUSE cloud images. The GCE image that is public and the Amazon image that is public both came from this project. The Azure image that is currently public is one built with SUSE Studio but will at some point also stem from the Cloud:Images OBS project.</p>
<p>Each cloud framework has it&#8217;s own set of tools. The tools are separated into two categories, initialization tools and command line tools. The initialization tools are tools that reside inside the image and these are generally services that interact with the cloud framework. For example <a href="http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" title="cloud-init">cloud-init</a> is such an initialization tool and it is used in OpenStack images, Amazon images, and Windows Azure images. The command line tools let you interact with the cloud framework to start and stop instances for example. All these tools get built in the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Cloud:Tools" title="Cloud:Tools">Cloud:Tools</a> project in OBS. From there you can install the command line tools into your system and interact with the cloud framework they support. I am also trying to get all these tools into <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/openSUSE:Factory" title="openSUSE:Factory">openSUSE:Factory</a> to make things a bit easier for image building and cloud interaction come 13.2.</p>
<p>With this lets take a brief closer look at each framework, in alphabetical order no favoritism here.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon EC2</strong></p>
<p>An openSUSE 13.1 image is available in all regions, the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) IDs are as follows:</p>
<p>sa-east-1       =&gt;  ami-2101a23c<br />
ap-northeast-1  =&gt;  ami-bde999bc<br />
ap-southeast-2  =&gt;  ami-b165fc8b<br />
ap-southeast-1  =&gt;  ami-e2e7b6b0<br />
eu-west-1       =&gt;  ami-7110ec06<br />
us-west-1       =&gt;  ami-44ae9101<br />
us-west-2       =&gt;  ami-f0402ec0<br />
us-east-1       =&gt;  ami-ff0e0696</p>
<p>These images use cloud-init as opposed to the &#8220;suse-ami-tools&#8221; that has been used previously and is no longer available in OBS. The cloud-init package is developed in launchpad and was started by the Canonical folks. Unfortunately to contribute you have to sign the Canonical Contributor Agreement (CCA). If you do not want to sign it or cannot sign it for company reasons you can still send stuff to the package and I&#8217;ll try and get the stuff integrated upstream. For the interaction with Amazon we have the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="aws-cli">aws-cli</a> package. The &#8220;aws&#8221; command line client supersedes all the ec2-*-tools and is an integrated package that can interact with all Amazon services, not just EC2. It is well documented fully open source and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cli" title="github">github</a>. The aws-cli package replaces the previously maintained ec2-api-tools package which I have removed from OBS.</p>
<p><strong>Google Compute Engine</strong></p>
<p>In GCE things work by name and the openSUSE 13.1 image is named opensuse131-20140227 and is available in all regions. Google images use a number of tools for initialization, google-daemon and google-startup-scripts. All the Google specific tools are in the Cloud:Tools project. Interaction with GCE is handled with two commands, gcutil and gsutil, both provided by the google-cloud-sdk package. As the name suggests google-cloud-sdk has the goal to unify the various Google tools, same basic idea as aws-cli, and Google is working on the unification. Unfortunately they have decided to do this on their own and there is no public project for google-cloud-sdk which makes contributing a bit difficult to say the least. The <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil" title="gsutil">gsutil</a> code is hosted on github, thus at least contributing to gsutil is straight forward. Both utilities, gsutil for storage and gcutil for interacting with GCE are well documented.</p>
<p>In GCE we also were able to stand up openSUSE mirrors. These have been integrated into our <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/MirrorBrain" title="mirrorbrain">mirrorbrain</a> infrastructure and are already being used quite heavily. The infrastructure team is taking care of the monitoring and maintenance and that deserves a big THANK YOU from my side. The nice thing about hosting the mirrors in GCE is that when you run an openSUSE instance in GCE you will not have to pay for network charges to pull your updated packages and things are really fast as the update server is located in the same data center as your instance.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Azure</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned previously the current image we have in Azure is based on a build from SUSE Studio. It does not yet contain cloud-init and only has <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure/WALinuxAgent" title="WALinuxAgent">WALinuxAgent</a> integrated. This implies that processing of user data is not possible in the image. User data processing requires cloud-init and I just put the finishing touches on cloud-init this week. Anyway, the image in Azure works just fine, and I have no time line when we might replace it with an image that contains cloud-init in addition to WALinuxAgent.</p>
<p>Interacting with Azure is a bit more cumbersome than with the other cloud frameworks. Well, let me qualify this with, if you want packages. The Azure command line tools are implemented using nodejs and are integrated into the <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/" title="npm">npm</a> nodejs package system. Thus, you can use npm to install everything you need. The nodejs implementation provides a bit of a problem in that we hardly have a nodejs infrastructure in the project. I have started packaging the dependencies, but there is a large number and thus this will take a while. Who would ever implement&#8230;.. but that&#8217;s a different topic.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where we are today. There is plenty of work left to do. For example we should unify the &#8220;generic&#8221; OpenStack image in Cloud:Images with the HP specific one, the HP cloud is based on OpenStack, and also get an openSUSE image published in the HP cloud. There&#8217;s tons of packaging left to do for nodejs modules to support the azure-cli tool. It would be great if we could have openSUSE mirrors in EC2 and Azure to avoid network charges for those using openSUSE images in those clouds. This requires discussions with Amazon and Microsoft, basically we need to be able to run those services for free, which implies that both would become sponsors of our project just like Google has become a sponsor of our project by letting us run the openSUSE mirrors in GCE.</p>
<p>So if you are interested in cloud and public cloud stuff get involved, there is plenty of work and lots of opportunities. If you just want to use the images in the public cloud go ahead, that&#8217;s why they are there. If you want to build on the images we have in OBS and customize them in your own project feel free and use them as you see fit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>How-to build a initrd-virtio on a fully encrypted volume group</h1>
<p>If like me you care about your data stored on your laptop, you certainly use a fully encrypted (excepted /boot) configuration based on lvm.</p>
<p>In my case I also like to create, build, fix packages locally with our tool osc. I&#8217;ve plenty of power, beefy ssd, so I dedicate a logical lvm for building cleanly package with qemu-kvm configuration, like <a href="http://build.opensuse.org">obs</a> does</p>
<h2>Prepare the kvm building system</h2>
<p>As root you create 2 lvm volume with lvcreate, one will be the build root, the other one will be the additional swap</p>
<p>In ~/.oscrc I enable the following parameters</p>
<pre>
build-type = kvm
build-device = /dev/mapper/vg0-lvobsbuild
build-swap = /dev/mapper/vg1-lvobsswap
build-memory = 4096
build-vmdisk-rootsize = 16000
build-vmdisk-swapsize = 4000
build-vmdisk-filesystem = ext4
</pre>
<p>You just have to adjust the Memory quantity and the device to what you create for your own environment.</p>

<p>As you can see, it warn you that you could create a -virtio initrd to use virtio acceleration (who contribute a patch for the typo <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
<br />But the command line is not completely correct in our case. It need the -d to be filled with the lvm buildroot to work as expected. If you successfully create the initrd-virtio you still will face a number of trouble, due to the way mkinitrd work.
</p>
<h2>Defeating the errors</h2>
<p>You remember that we have a fully encrypted volume group, and as a clever tool mkinitrd will feed the initrd with all the tools needed to boot your system.<br />
<br />But that mean it will forget the lv buildroot we ask, and will put unnecessary tools and options.

<h2>Find a solution</h2>
<p>We want an optimized -virtio initrd, which filter all the lvm and crypting tools we don&#8217;t need. Also there&#8217;s no need to encumber it with graphic blob.<br />
Then I create a small script I&#8217;ve called patch-initrd-virtio (source below) which exactly do that work anytime I&#8217;ve a kernel change.<br />
As it need to be run by root only, I normally place it in /root/bin/

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I tried to get a DVB-T card to work with a new antenna on a new 13.1 install.<br />
I know it was working, because I ran it with 12.3 on this machine last year.</p>
<p>hwinfo &#8211;tv<br />
showed<br />
  Model: &#8220;Hauppauge computer works WinTV HVR-1110&#8243;<br />
  Vendor: pci 0&#215;1131 &#8220;Philips Semiconductors&#8221;<br />
  Device: pci 0&#215;7133 &#8220;SAA7131/SAA7133/SAA7135 Video Broadcast Decoder&#8221;</p>
<p>So after plugging everything in, I started kaffeine, which still knew about all local channels, but could not tune.<br />
<a href="http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hauppauge_WinTV-HVR-1110">http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hauppauge_WinTV-HVR-1110</a> gave the important hint that one needs a firmware file. After that was in /lib/firmware and after a reboot, came the next try. kaffeine now would show 99% SNR, so a good signal and even know about what is currently on air, however picture remained black.<br />
kaffeine hinted that it needs extra software, but could not find it, even though packman repos were available (annoying bug).<br />
Installing kde3-kaffeine from packman did not help.<br />
<a href="http://opensuse-community.org/">http://opensuse-community.org/</a> finally helped &#8211; I needed some codec packages from the packman repo.<br />
Now everything is working after less than an hour.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you might know, we are focusing our development efforts in two fronts, namely <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2014-01/msg00317.html">openQA</a> and <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2014-01/msg00278.html">staging projects</a>. As we just started we don&#8217;t have fireworks for you (yet) but we did some solid ground work that we are going to build upon.</p>
<h3>Working on openQA</h3>
<p>We are organizing our daily job in openQA into highly focused sprints of two weeks. The focus of the first sprint was clear: cleanup the current codebase to empower future development and lower the entry barrier for casual contributors, which can be translated as &#8220;cleaning our own mess&#8221;. We created <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/67">some tasks in progress</a>, grouped in a version with a surprising and catchy name: Sprint 01.</p>
<h4>Got my mojo workin&#8217;</h4>
<p>Up to now, openQA web interface was written using just a bunch of custom CGI scripts and some configuration directives in Apache. We missed a convenient way to access to all the bell and whistles of modern web development and some tools to make the code more readable, reliable and easier to extend and test. In short, we missed a proper web development framework. We evaluated the most popular Perl-based alternatives and we finally decided to go for <a href="http://mojolicio.us/">Mojolicious</a> for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides all the functionality we demand from a web framework while being lightweight and unbloated.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s stated as a &#8220;real time framework&#8221; which, buzzwords apart, means that is designed from the ground to fully support Comet (long-polling), EventSource and WebSockets. Very handy technologies for implementing some features in openQA.</li>
<li>It really &#8220;feels&#8221; very close to <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>, which makes Ruby on Rails     developers feel like at home. And we have quite some Rails developers hanging around, don&#8217;t we? Just think about OBS, software.o.o, WebYast, progress.o.o, OSEM, the TSP app&#8230;
<li>Mojolicious motto is &#8220;web development can be fun again&#8221;. Who could resist to that?</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ve now reached the end of the sprint and we already have something that looks exactly the same than what we had before, but using Mojolicious internally. We are very happy with the framework and we are pretty confident that future development of openQA will be easier and faster than ever. OpenQA has mojo!</p>
<h4>The database layer in openQA</h4>
<p>Another part that we worked on during first sprint was the database layer. The user interface part of openQA use a SQLite database to store the jobs and workers registered in the system. The connection between the code and the database was expressed directly in SQL using a simple API.</p>
<p>We have replaced this layer with another equivalent that uses an ORM (Object-relational mapping) in Perl (<a href="http://www.dbix-class.org/">DBIx::Class</a>). Every data model in openQA is now a true object that can be created, copied and moved between the different layers of the application. Quite handy.</p>
<p>To make sure we don&#8217;t forget anything, we created a bunch of tests covering the whole functionality of the original code, running this test suite after each step of the migration. In this way we have achieved two goals: we now have a simple way to share and update information through the whole system and we can migrate very easily to a different database engine (something that we plan to do in the future).</p>
<h3>What to do with staging</h3>
<p>Over the time, coolo had accumulated quite some scripts that helped him with Factory. Most of them are actually related to something we are doing right now: the staging projects. So in the end we basically migrated all relevant ones to <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory">github</a> and one by one we are merging their functionality to staging plugin. We also experimented with test frameworks that we could use to test the plugin itself, selected few and we even have a first test! The final plan is to have the whole plugin functionality covered with a proper test suite, so we will know when something breaks. Currently, there is a lot of mess in our repo and the plugin itself need big cleanup, but we are working on it.</p>
<h3>Contributions are welcome</h3>
<p>If you want to help but wonder where to start, we identified tasks that are good to dive into the topic and named them &#8220;easy hacks&#8221;: mostly self contained tasks we expect to have little effort but we lack the time to do right now. Just jump over the list for <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/73">openQA</a> or <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/69">staging projects</a>.</p>
<p>For grabbing the code related to staging project, you only need to clone the <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory">already mentioned repository</a>. The openQA code is spread in several repositories (<a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/openQA">two</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse">three</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst-needles-opensuse">four</a>), but setting up your own instance to play and hack is a piece of cake using <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/openQA">the packages</a> available in OBS (built automatically for every git push).</p>
<p>If you simply want to see what we are doing in more detail, take a look at progress.o.o, we have both <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqav3">openQA</a> and <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/stagings">Staging projects</a> there.</p>
<p>We are having a lot of fun, and we encourage you to join us!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Fosdem 2014</h2>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12271807465_4eb0674948_b.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12271807465_4eb0674948_b-150x150.jpg" alt="fosdem 2014 - full" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10496" style="margin:8px" /></a>
<p>Again this year, <a href="https://fosdem.org/">Fosdem</a> was really delightful, a bit crowdy as hell concerning a number of conference rooms.</p>
<p>But if there&#8217;s a constant, it is the awesomeness of the Fosdem staff and its armada of volunteers. Please all of you who made this event so great, receive in the name of openSUSE&#8217;s community our warmest thanks and congratulations.</p>
<p>I will not make a mistake if I predict a big success for the different talk&#8217;s videos, in the next following weeks.</p>
<h2 style="clear:both">openSUSE merchandising new collection</h2>
<p>After a <b>loooong wait</b>, perceived as a century, openSUSE Booth was furbished with the next generation of merchandising stuff.<br />
<br />At least some part of the complete kit, which should be available in April.</p>
<p><span id="more-10494"></span></p>
<h3>The new design &amp; branding ideas</h3>
<p>This was the first public showing of the new posters &amp; goodies design. The basis of the design appear first during HackWeek&#8217;10<br />
<img src="https://hackweek.suse.com/assets/hackweek-logo-10-2dbf37934f48409e969e0339f472bab4.png" style="background:#c4c4c4;margin: 10px;padding: 10px;width:50%;height:50%" /><br />
<br />this Geeko&#8217;s was put on pullover <i>I&#8217;m still looking where I can grab one, so take care of yours if you own one <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </i></p>
<h3>Posters</h3>
<p>We got three kind of new posters, and one block-note. I would like to thanks booth&#8217;s helpers for spreading them on almost any Fosdem&#8217;s building free walls.</p>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-discover-it.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-discover-it-213x300.jpg" alt="2014-discover-it" width="213" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10499" /></a><br />
<h4>Discover it &#8211; Bulb A2</h4>
<p>With elegant dark green and white symbol on big format, it won the heart’s public.<br />
Several of them were offered.
</p>
</div>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em;clear:both"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-block-note.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-block-note-198x300.jpg" alt="2014-A3-block-note" width="198" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10497" /></a><br />
<h4>Block-note meeting or communication papers A3</h4>
<p>
Useful on a booth to pick feedback, announce something in an fashionned way.<br />
I hope we will have the A4 format too.
</p>
</div>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em;clear:both">
<h4>Linux for open minds A3</h4>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-linux-for-openminds.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-linux-for-openminds-209x300.jpg" alt="2014-linux-for-openminds" width="209" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10500" /></a></p>
<p>With its light green and zen symbols I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the perfect poster in an office, being not too intrusive.<br />
<br />It found its place on walls around the Fosdem, but on the booth A3 format reduce its attractive effect.<br />
The second default (if it&#8217;s one) project name and logo are small, bottom placed so could escape visitor attention.
</p>
</div>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em;clear:both">
<h4>We believe &#8211; cube way A3</h4>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-we_believe.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-we_believe-200x300.jpg" alt="2014-A3-we_believe" width="200" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10498" /></a></p>
<p>The &quot;we believe&quot; collection was always my favorite one. But I must admit the format proposed doesn&#8217;t work on booth. It lacks contrast and/or appealing colors.<br />
If you stand at more than 1.5 meters the message (our guidelines) are almost unreadable.<br />
<br />Look like this one need another development iteration.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em;clear:both">
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth-300x225.jpg" alt="fosdem-2014-booth" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10502" /></a></p>
<h5>Stickers</h5>
<h6>Geeko&#8217;s stickers</h6>
<p>Appreciated and adopted by fans, and the public. The size is perfect. </p>
<p>We still get a number of request to have some with transparent background, which would allow them as perfect decoration for any kind of devices.</p>
<h6>Geeko&#8217;s keyboard patch stickers</h6>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a very limited edition of Geeko&#8217;s keyboard patch stickers. For the first time, you will have pleasure to press the meta key.<br />
They literally create a rush on the booth, we save some to patch our demonstration computer with them.</p>
<p>I predict a long and successful life to this article. I hope future booth box will contain thousand of them.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth2.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth2-278x300.jpg" alt="fosdem-2014-booth2" width="278" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10510" /></a><br />
<h5>Table covers</h5>
<p>Done in synthetic material, colored with a beautiful green and proudly displaying the openSUSE logo. They are light resistant flexible.<br />
<br />Excellent article.</p>
<p>As there&#8217;s 2 models, one with big Geeko on top and the other one having openSUSE written on bottom front, they can&#8217;t be use for the same mission.<br />
What impact would have one with the big Geeko sitting on the front with just one openSUSE? We should have some others shoot to be sure to get the best model.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-flag.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-flag-128x300.jpg" alt="fosdem-2014-flag" width="128" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10511" /></a><br />
<h5>Flag (alpha testing)</h5>
<p>We also got a kind of flag, in an alpha-state, we fixed it on top of an official SUSE roll-up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not sure how to use this one. As a stand-up like the open-mind poster, the who&#8217;s behind the message is bottom placed which<br />
is always a bit hidden if placed on a roll-up.<br />
As a flag, the holes are missing to use it on different kind of support.
</p>
<h3>Flyer &amp; brochure</h3>
<p>The cheat sheet encounter a big success, using the other side to present key related tools (obs, openqa, susestudio) allow people on booth to introduce them or talk about it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a number of commands that need to be removed from it (obsolete or deprecated way of doing things)</p>
<p>Flyer, even with the printing default and small shift in the bulb, find their audience.</p>
<h3>openSUSE DVD by Open Press</h3>
<p>We received finally 1400 DVD of the Open Press&#8217;s edition containing Live KDE / Gnome 64 bits. We spread out 1000 of them, 200 were split between Advocates for future events in Austria, Spain and Greece.</p>
<h3>openSUSE conference cube box &amp; penguins</h3>
<p>Those two articles were unfortunately a failure at Fosdem booth. They are over complicated to build, and need too much material (scissors, glue) and too much time (15 minutes pro piece)</p>
<p>They should have been used to advertise the conference, but are not practical, once assembled they took too much place. Same on printed material, A3 is too big for any bags.</p>
<p>Croatian team bring a lot of them to use them locally. If we want to keep those kind of article for booth the printed result should be perforated and you should able to build the object with only your ten fingers in less than a minute.</p>
<h2>Missing parts</h2>
<p>I can&#8217;t be satisfied with what we received, our booth look so poor compared to what we usually present to the public.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget those article can be sold</p>
<ul>
<li>t-shirts : where are our fancy and inspiriting t-shirts?</li>
<li>usb sticks</li>
<li>Pens</li>
<li>Pins</li>
<li>hat</li>
<li>plush : so beloved</li>
<li>Old Toad bottles (*)</li>
</ul>
<p>(*) About our Old Toad beer, I&#8217;ve explained to people that nothing is impossible if and only if the community will assume the responsibility about managing the stock, carrying the boxes, and drink or sell the minimal order in less than 6 months. We&#8217;ll see if a Old Toad Team appear soon.</p>
<h2>Computers</h2>
<p>Just a small remark, our two touchscreen computers (only one has accepted to come at Fosdem) start to show their age.</p>
<h2>First part conclusion</h2>
<p>I will conclude this article which was more oriented on the new marketing stuff. There&#8217;s still quite works to be 100% useful and successful. I will come back soon with another article with some thoughts about how openSUSE booth has worked and details we could improve in the future
</p>
<p>Thanks for your reading, comments &amp; feedback are open!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately there was some confusion regarding our communication. We, at the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OpenSUSE_team">openSUSE Team@SUSE</a> are deeply aware that our communication needs to be improved. So in the hope to make everything clear again, here is the summary to clear up what is really going on and what was not happening.</p>
<h3>Long story short:</h3>
<ul>
<li>There <strong>WILL</strong> be openSUSE 13.2 in November 2014</li>
<li>13.2 <strong>WILL</strong> have security and maintenance support provided by SUSE</li>
<li>We <strong>WILL</strong> have coolo as release manager for 13.2</li>
<li>SUSE is <strong>NOT decreasing</strong> manpower put into openSUSE</li>
<li>Everybody from the community is welcome and encouraged to be involved with, and if they want to, take over some parts of the release process and we will support you the best we can in doing that</li>
</ul>
<h3>Now for the long story.</h3>
<p>Our team and only our team &#8211; openSUSE@SUSE &#8211; is going to work on improving &#8216;tooling&#8217; side of the openSUSE project until August. These changes will benefit openSUSE by making it easier to produce better releases in the future.</p>
<p>Nothing changes for the rest of SUSE. SUSE is not abandoning openSUSE. The rest of SUSE will still do the same things they were doing until now and continue to keep openSUSE awesome. This includes Maintenance, Security, Infrastructure, and many other teams besides the openSUSE Team at SUSE who actively support the openSUSE project.</p>
<h3>What is our plan?</h3>
<p>Our plan is to make sure that future openSUSE releases are easier for everyone to produce. As we grow we could keep putting in more and more full-time release managers (if we find them somewhere), but this approach is probably unsustainable and, more importantly, goes against our desire to empower the community to do more as part of openSUSE.</p>
<p>Therefore, we decided to improve our tools to ensure that making a release is much more straightforward and reliable and we can reduce and distribute the workload needed for integration and release. To make this happen we need time and everyone from the team to work on adapting the tooling side. We also would welcome volunteers to help us with tools and with the following release(s).</p>
<p>With the release date now set in November (mirroring roadmap for 13.1), first milestone should be released in May. That is a perfect oportunity to go to openSUSE Conference in Croatia where we can meet up, gather volunteers to help and discuss how to work. Remember that openSUSE Travel Support is in place to sponsor everyone who needs financial help to get to the event.</p>
<p>Hopefully now we cleared things up a little and we are really sorry again for our poor communication &#8211; We&#8217;re going to work on it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we stated in our communication over the time, our team&#8217;s main focus for foreseeable future is Factory and how to manage all those contributions. Goal is <strong>not</strong> to increase the number of SRs that is coming to Factory, but to make sure we can process more and to make sure we see even well hidden consequences to make sure that Factory is &#8220;stable&#8221; and &#8220;usable&#8221;.</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sprayg-263x300.jpg" alt="sprayg" width="263" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10485" />
<p>Not really part of our current sprints, but something that will hopefully help us is <i>spec-cleaner</i> that Tomáš Chvátal and Tomáš Čech were working on lately during their free time/hackweek. What is it trying to address? Currently, there are some packaging guidelines, but when you write a spec file for your software, you still have plenty of choices. How do you order all the information in the header? Do you use curly brackets around macros? Do you use macros? Which ones do you use and which not? Do you use binaries in dependencies? Package config? Perl symbols? Package names? There is <i>format_spec_file</i> obs service that tries to unify a little bit the coding style but leaves quite some of the stuff up to you. Not necessarily a bad thing, but if you have to compare changes and review packages that are using completely different coding styles the process becomes harder and slower.</p>
<p><i>spec-cleaner</i> is <i>format_spec_file</i> taken to another level. It tries to unify coding style as much as it can. It uses consistent conventions, makes most of the decisions mentioned previously for you and if you already decided for one way in the past, it will try to convert your spec file to follow the conventions that it specifies. It&#8217;s not enforcing anything, it&#8217;s standalone script and therefore you don&#8217;t have to be worried that you spec file will be out of your control. You can run it, verify the result (actually, you should verify the results as there might still be some bugs) and commit it to OBS. If we all do it, our packages will all look more alike and it will be easier to read and review them.</p>
<p>How to try it? How to help? Well, code is on <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/spec-cleaner">GitHub</a> and packages are in <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Tools/spec-cleaner">OBS</a>. You may have a version of it in your distribution, but that one is heavily outdated (even the 13.1 version), so add openSUSE:Tools repo and try the version from there.</p>
<pre>zypper ar -f obs://openSUSE:Tools/openSUSE_13.1 openSUSE-Tools
zypper in spec-cleaner</pre>
<p>You can then go to some local checkout and try what changes does it propose for your spec file. Easiest way is to just let it do stuff by calling it and taking a look at changes afterwards.</p>
<pre>spec-cleaner -p -i *.spec
osc diff</pre>
<p>If it works, great, we will have more unified spec files. If it doesn&#8217;t, file a  <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/spec-cleaner/issues">bug</a> <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The x86_64 edition of openSUSE Education&#8217;s <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e" title="Li-f-e">Li-f-e</a> live DVD supports PXE booting the iso over the network, here is how to do it:</p>
<p>* Install Li-f-e (Switch to GRUB from Installation Summary page if your hardware does not support EFI boot ), make sure you have plenty of space assigned to / partition(about 20G)<br />
* Set up LTSP by following this <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:LTSP%20quick%20start%2012.2%20Edu" title="LTSP Quick Start">quick start guide</a><br />
* Create /srv/nfs folder and copy Li-f-e iso there<br />
* Run the following as root in terminal:<br />
<code><br />
mount /srv/nfs/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e.x86_64-13.1.1.iso /mnt<br />
cp /mnt/boot/x86_64/loader/linux /srv/tftpboot/boot/linux-life64<br />
cp /mnt/boot/x86_64/loader/initrd /srv/tftpboot/boot/initrd-life64<br />
echo "/srv/nfs *(ro,no_root_squash,async,no_subtree_check)" &gt;&gt; /etc/exports<br />
cat &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt; /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default<br />
LABEL Li-f-e<br />
kernel boot/linux-life64<br />
append initrd=boot/initrd-life64 isofrom_device=nfs:10.0.0.254:/srv/nfs/ isofrom_system=/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e.x86_64-13.1.1.iso nonm<br />
IPAPPEND 2<br />
EOF<br />
chkconfig rpcbind on &amp;&amp; service rpcbind restart<br />
chkconfig nfsserver on &amp;&amp; service nfsserver restart<br />
</code><br />
Now you can PXE boot any machine over the network, select Li-f-e from the end of the boot menu to boot live DVD iso instead of normal LTSP session.</p>
<p>Please note that if you install Li-f-e booted over the network then after the installation  you will need to remove &#8220;nonm&#8221; boot option using yast2 bootloader to get NetworkManager working again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a small note about a new build (-3) of the 13.251 fglrx version.</p>
<h3>Changelog</h3>
<p>AMD has changed /etc/ati/amdpcsdb.default database in its tarball</p>
<p>The packages have just been published on geeko.ioda.net, so next time you zypper up the new build should appear as a proposed update</p>
<h3>Notice</h3>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above.<br />
For older gpu, the fglrx-legacy is still 13.1, and thus didn&#8217;t work with openSUSE 12.3 or above.<br />
<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx_legacy">SDB:AMD_fgrlx_legacy</a><br />
Beware of that, and prefer the free open-source radeon driver which came out of the box from your openSUSE distribution.<br />
For 12.3 and especially 13.1 the free radeon often offer a better experience than the old fglrx-legacy.
</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
