		<description><![CDATA[Dude, could you please stop announcing every single version update you do on the planet? The people who have it installed get an update anyways, others don&#039;t care and all of us have those meaningless posts on the planet.

Don&#039;t get me wrong, it&#039;s great that you maintain &#038; update packages but IMHO announcing every single update on the planet is just plain spamming. Just imagine how &quot;great&quot; that were if everybody would do it. Therefore, thanks for stopping it ;)]]></description>
