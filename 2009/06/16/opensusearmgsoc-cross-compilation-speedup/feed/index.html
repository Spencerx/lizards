		<description><![CDATA[The simple reason for the speedup is that for your average 8-core or 16-core x86 build box, building an x86 package - even a very large one - can take only a few minutes. I can build a kernel for ARM using cross-compilation in less than 2 minutes, using -j10 parallel makes (it goes faster if I just use -j but I really do not like the way it impacts everyone else&#039;s sessions :)

When you run a package build through QEMU you get a single emulated ARM processor running on a SINGLE PHYSICAL CPU core. The other 7-15 processors are sitting idle while this emulated box struggles to translate to x86 instructions and compile ARM code.

This is where the speedup comes from. Most of the problems with cross-compile builds are actually CAUSED by tools which are meant to take the problem away - GNU autoconf is a horrible mistake in design which allows developers to make cross-compilable packages but nobody is talented enough to script it correctly to make it work.]]></description>
