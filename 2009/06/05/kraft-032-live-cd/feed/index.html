		<description><![CDATA[I really welcome any application for small businesses. For a long time, I have been looking for an easy to use invoice application.

There is no shortage of this in Windows, but if you just want something plain and simple to add some items to be billed to a customer and make a pdf invoice, you either have to use OpenOffice or a big accounting system.

Looking forward to see the results of your efforts!]]></description>
