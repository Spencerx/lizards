		<description><![CDATA[Carlos, thanks for feedback. Could you please provide some more information?

What version you used before?
How big is the slowness? For example, was it 1sec before and is it 20sec now, or?
Does it happen with all types of documents (Writer,Spreadsheet,Impress) or just with Spreadsheet?

We increased the limit of rows in Calc. It caused performance problems. We fixed many of them before the release but probably not all...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[unfortunately, the problem occurred with all files (also new ones). Searching the internet, I found similar complaints even with earlier versions of OOo (and also under WinXP), but no consistent explanations or solutions. I didn&#039;t check out the relevant bugzilla systems, will do so ASAP.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for all the fine work.  I work with many ex-Mac people still on PowerPC - hope you can squeeze in a stable up-to-date OOo build for PPC openSUSE 11.1.  They tend to eval every Linux by the quality of OpenOffice, which largely depends on the version installed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Strange, I do not any problem here. Just by chance, do you know whether it happened with more documents or with only one? Was it a huge document or a small one? Would be possible to open a bug at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.novell.com&quot; title=&quot;https://bugzilla.novell.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://bugzilla.novell.com&lt;/a&gt; against the product OpenOffice.org and attach the problematic file there?]]></description>
