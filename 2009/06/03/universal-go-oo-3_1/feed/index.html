		<description><![CDATA[Hmm, it is hard to say what is wrong on you system. It is possible that the installation is inconsistent (mixed upstream and Go-oo binaries). I would try to reinstall it. Please, remove all the OOo-related packages before. You might use the following commands:

    1. remove all ooo related packages by the command:  rpm -e `rpm -qa &#124; grep -e ooobasis -e openoffice`
    2. rm -rf /opt/openoffice.org3

If it does not help. Could you please report the bug at https://bugzilla.novell.com against the product &quot;OpenOffice.org&quot;? It would be great if you could attach strace, see http://en.opensuse.org/Bugs:OOo#How_to_get_strace_log.

The bug will be solved by the developer who is responsible for the Go-oo linux build (I have only uploaded and announced it). Anyway, he would need the strace log.]]></description>

When I start from xterm: /opt/openoffice.org3/program/scalc, I see splash-screen, and that is all.

Go-oo 3.0 has not problem. Openoffice 3.1 from Sun has not problem.

		<description><![CDATA[We do our best to release Go-oo at the same time as  the upstream OOo is released. Unfortunately, it is not that easy because Go-oo has many extra changes and they need to be stabilized as well. The Go-oo release is usually delayed by few days or even weeks. The OOo-3.1 release was quite complicated. The upstream release was delayed by more than one month. The Go-oo release was delayed even more because we decided to have there OpenXML export in a useful state. Also the extended row limit in Calc caused some regressions that were discovered too late. We will do our best to avoid such a big delay in the future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was confusing when Open Office 3.1 was released a months ago and Go-oo 3.1 was released later. I didn´t know what to download. I thought that Go-oo was released at the same time.
Both products should be released at exactly the same time.]]></description>
