A HD webcam and mic are also part of the eyetracker suite so it&#039;s fine for &#039;thinking aloud&#039; studies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Also, liking the Kickoff improvements. However, in the All Programs tab, when you go into a category, the name of the current submenu shouldn&#039;t be used in the link back to the previous menu. The same visual design could be used, but only make the area around the arrow infront of the label part of the link. Links should be the name of the target, not the current location. Using the current location as a link to the previous location is very confusing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What type of eyetracker do you have? The problem with most of the ones I know of is that the hardware only runs in Windows. As a result you have to use VMWare in order to run KDE. I&#039;ve had problems with this in the past because all of the eyetrackers I&#039;ve used are resource hogs, and even with high powered machines, everything runs slow.

Also, please please PLEASE triangulate your data if you use eyetracking data. By itself it is useless because it can&#039;t tell you what the user is thinking. It has to be used in conjunction with some reflection data in order to mean anything.]]></description>
