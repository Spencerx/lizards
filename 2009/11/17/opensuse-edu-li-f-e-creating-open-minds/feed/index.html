		<description><![CDATA[Continuation of the LTSP installation

Skipped step 2 as indicated (when Li-f-e is installed all required packages are too)

Step 3 ~ Followed the link http://en.opensuse.org/LTSP/Quick_start/Easy-LTSP
Didn&#039;t click on the webpage Install as it said, only for 10.3 and 11.0 
Li-f-e is 11.2 and Easy-LTSP seems to be installed

Instead clicked on Prebuild Image in Easy-LTSP

It appeared to have found the network so clicked Yes
It promptly failed indicating:  bash: kiwi-ltsp-setup: command not found

Retried and saw it was eth0 so clicked NO and changed DHCP interface to eth1.
Retried and got same failure
Retried, clicked No then Advance and found it referenced SUSE Ver 11.1,
Change it to  11.2 but got the same failure

Easy-LTSP obviously isn&#039;t working so went to the manual portion of step 3
It said: Make sure all the parameters are as per your network setup in /etc/sysconfig/kiwi-ltsp.
Checked and found 32 parameters.
Guessed it was all ok so did the kiwi-ltsp-setup -b and kiwi-ltsp-setup -c
A bunch of stuff happened resulting with ---Setup Completed---   !!OKAY!!

Not ready to move this to the main VMware Server yet to try PXE.
Instead I checked Security and Users but didn&#039;t see 5 thin client users as promised.
Wonder where they are?    Nowhere, I suspect.

So steps 2 ~ 4 went slightly better, if you don&#039;t count guesses, false starts, etc.
Somehow the install wasn&#039;t as easy as stated in the &quot;Some highlights...&quot; blurb.

And there probably is still much to do, based on what I remember from the last one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First ~ I use and praise openSUSE.

Our library web server runs 10.3,the director is up to 11,
We have 2 PAC&#039;s at 10 a staff member at 10.3  and another PC at some version.

Initially we had Edubuntu with 5 thin clients but I wanted to switch to openSUSE.
After days and days of frustration I got 11.0 running.
It has been running for months.
Now I want to build 11.2 
I expected an easy time as everything should be working with good documentation.

But I forsee the same days of frustration with 11.2 even though the highlights imply it&#039;s just about ready to run.
KIWI-LTSP will do it all.

Not finding KIWI-LTSP I run EASY-LTSP.
It has a lot of confusing options so I clicked HELP.
But HELP&#039;s not implemented yet.

System help and the list of applications don&#039;t help me, so on to Google.
It finds a lot of information. Way too much in fact.
Did find http://en.opensuse.org/Education/Live with a KIWI-LTSP link and a Quick Start Guide.
Ah! Success. 4 Easy steps and I can even skip number 2.

Step 1.Network Configuration.  Do &quot;yast2 lan&quot;
Oops! There&#039;s a warning. It&#039;s controlled by NetworkManager.
Finally got past that expecting to see the Network Card Setup.
Nope! Just Network Setting with (2) 79c970&#039;s and (1) Network Bridge.
I did install with (2) NIC&#039;s. But it wasn&#039;t in the instructions.
You just have to know that I imagine.
I&#039;ll work on this for a while and see what happens.

Then maybe steps 2 ~ 4 will go better.
And I wonder how the 5 users mentioned are locked down?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the tip! After changing the / partition size to 15 GB I made the installation successfully. The installation of Li-f-e took considerably longer time, comparing with that of OpenSUSE 11.2. 

The funny thing I found is that I wanted to install a KDE desktop but after the installation I got a Gnome one. Today I repeated the installation and got the same again and can&#039;t figure out what was wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[unixhead download worked.

Li-f-e is now installed under VMware Server on a Dell Laptop (Vista home premium)

Took a few tries to get the partitioning correct.
I&#039;m far ,far from an expert on linux
Someone more experienced might elaborate on the procedure for the rest of us.


Looks good so far.
Next is setup/test the 5 user PXE boot.]]></description>
