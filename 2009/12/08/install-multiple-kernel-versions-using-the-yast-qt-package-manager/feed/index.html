		<description><![CDATA[Uh -- this would be confusing to exactly whom? To a newbie who just installed openSUSE for the very first time -- but one who reads developers&#039; blogs? Get real.

And, no offense, if you are that clueless, better not mess with something as central to your system as the software management stack. Better be glad that missing dependency saved you from wrecking your system.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s submitted to YaST:Head. As soon as libzypp 6.26.3 is available YaST:Head will contain the latest version.
Libzypp figures out which packages are mutliversion packages by reading /etc/zypp/zypp.conf. As far as I know the database doesn&#039;t know anything about multiversions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please make it clearer, upfront that this is development and future stuff coming in next release, not a tip to enabling a hidden 11.2 feature.  Wew users get confused by official looking blog items, and end up adding Factory repo&#039;s and get themselves into messes.

libzypp &#062;= 6.26.3 is needed by yast2-qt-pkg-2.18.19-3.1.x86_64

If you want ppl to try it and test it against 11.2, then ALL the package upgrades need to be together in a repo.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yey, any time frame when this will hit a more official repository?
And manually editing /etc/zypp/zypp.conf is just a temporary solution I take it? Couldn&#039;t this be determined through the database?]]></description>
