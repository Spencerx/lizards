		<description><![CDATA[Well, you can always look for EBooks that doesn’t have these restrictions. For music is hasn’t worked so far. The question is, if this will work for EBooks. I don’t know, the buyers will decide. In case you need EBooks without DRM, I can highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedbooks.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;feedbooks.com&lt;/a&gt;. They only have content which copyright is expired. If you are interested in, for example, Sherlock Holmes you will enjoy it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I do mean DRM (excuse the swear word...). And I did suspect that there was no readily available (or at all) solution for Linux as of now. Then again, for now I don&#039;t need it either. It&#039;s just one of those features that would be, sometimes, good to have in case you come across a publisher dead-set on the idea of drm.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool, the author of the program wrote a commend! :-)

Thanks for your comment. I know, that it is possible to reduce the size of the icons, but that&#039;s not what I&#039;ve meant. The icons are indeed smaller, but the text still remains the same. :-)

At the moment I have to work on a laptop and if you are restricted to a smaller screen resolution you will notice the difference. ;-)  It would make work much more easier if you could move the &quot;View&quot; button.

Your tip with the &quot;v&quot; key was very helpful. Although it is obvious, I never thinkg of that. ;-)

But anyway, apart from this icon thing I really enjoy Calibre. Thanks for all your efforts and keep up the good work!]]></description>

with &quot;encrypted&quot; you mean DRM (digital rights management), right? As far as I know, this is not possible with Calibre. I don&#039;t know of a solution for Linux.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice! I know you&#039;re not the author (or you would have said so...), but I thank you for bringing this very nice piece of software to my attention!

Just wondering if you (or anyone else reading this): is it possible to read e-books (using calibre or otherwise, without resorting to wine and/or virtualized windows) that are encrypted?]]></description>
