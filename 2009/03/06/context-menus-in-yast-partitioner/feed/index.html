		<description><![CDATA[To me, the old Partitioner was just fine. Using the new setup in 11.1 was not an issue though. I really can&#039;t see what all the fuss is about. Except, I suppose if you have a limited understanding in this area - It is a little difficult just to see exactly what you have and where. I agree with @vespas that this: http://files.fosswire.com/2007/06/gparted_1_big.jpg
Is a much better graphical view.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This doesn&#039;t fix the main problem of this design: it is almost impossible to use in the YaST installer, because it can&#039;t be properly resized (try to install 11.1 on a netbook for your fun).

		<description><![CDATA[Looks awesome, but I agree that having some seperator between disks, raids, lvms, ... and adding some indentation (e.g. indent partitions relative to disks and logical partitions relative to the surounding extended partition) would make it much easier to keep an overview.

I also assume that the context menu doesn&#039;t work only with the top level menu entry but for every single one where it makes sense (e.g. also for single partitions, logical volumes, ...), right?

If that is true, all my usability issues with the new partitioner are solved (or at least I can&#039;t remember another one now ;D) and the only thing I`m missing installation wise is supporting installation with an encrypted root file system ( https://features.opensuse.org/305633 ). Please add that for 11.2 since it is pretty much mandatory for laptops (and doesn&#039;t harm on desktops), also openSUSE is one of the last distros not supporting this (further, since all the necessarys software is in place, it should only be a matter of addapting some installation scipt) :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice, but wrong example. Neither [Add...] nor [Resize] nor [Delete] buttons are present under the dialog thus this functionality should neither appear in the table. The table context menu is an additional menu but should only copy the already present functionality (buttons).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tree views (and deep menu levels) both have the same problem: it is difficult to find something and difficult to get an overall view. I tend to think folders should be virtual and used for grouping (or sets), so you could easily have overlapping folders.
At-the-end-of-the-day, this is an expert tool for those who know what they are doing and want to do it quickly, but with some &#039;undo&#039; functionality.
I can see some value to knowing whats in what, as the previous poster suggests.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[how about a separator between different devices to make things clearer? Also indentation of logical drives within extended partitions would be nice.
e.g.

/dev/sda         80Gb Hitachi bla bla
 /dev/sda1       80Gb Extended Partition
  /dev/sda5      5Gb  
  /dev/sda6      5Gb
------------------------------------------
/dev/sdb        120Gb Maxtor
 /dev/sdb1      2Gb   Primary partition
 /dev/sdb2      100Gb Primary partition

etc.
Otherwise, for a more complete solution, how about a graphical interface like that of gparted/kde partition manager showing the partitions like this: http://files.fosswire.com/2007/06/gparted_1_big.jpg]]></description>
