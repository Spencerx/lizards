		<description><![CDATA[Well, I try to upgrade my computer using this approach, but, it not work well. At some point I start to receive an error saying that all downloaded file could not be found, so, I click &quot;IGNORE&quot; every time it happen. After a reboot, in the grub screen it, indeed, shows me Opensuse 11.1 option, but when I log in there no network, I try IPCONFIG, but receive - There is no such file. I have to use dhclient to get an IP. So, I think I will have to spend some more time to solve this. Nonetheless, this approach do what it is intend, upgrade Opensuse from 11.0 to 11.1.
