		<description><![CDATA[Great Feature Gentleman. The integration of this will be a revolution because it will fill up the gap between the users and the OBS. Broken or not I will just use it since I have the Factory Distro installed.

Best Regards to the module maintainer as well as the whole Dev Team for the Great Job being done.

openSUSE Linux is simply unbreackable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately yast2 -l shows only those YaST Modules that appear in the YaST Control Center.

Webpin Search module is a bit hidden because we planned it to be a Software Manager plug-in and, frankly, it&#039;s still a bit broken and needs fixing. So, let&#039;s say it&#039;s a preview of an experimental YaST Module and should be fully available in openSUSE 11.2.]]></description>
