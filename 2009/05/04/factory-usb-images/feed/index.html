		<description><![CDATA[I did this exactly, and when I boot up from it, the opensuse screen shows and I selest usb oem install. Then, it loads and freezes, when I check the working terminal window by pressing alt+f2/3, I see the log saying it can&#039;t load &#039;sysimage&#039; from sysconfig, and that the system will reboot.

I&#039;m using the kde amd64 11.2 usb image. I also tried loading it in safe mode, but the same thing happened. What should I do?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice, got it working on a laptop, except for the silly broadcom whireless and the nvidia card, drivers wont install because of kernel dependencies.

More intresting is my main PC, runs 11.0 very smooth, the usb image goes through the installing and when you reach login screen both mouse and keyboard (usb) stop working, got to puzzle that one out :)]]></description>

If openSUSE can make this image regularly, it will become a good advertisement for OpenSUSE.

		<description><![CDATA[hi Stephan,
Thanks for the images, I&#039;ve been searching for them since quite a while, till succeeded to make one from the LiveCD today! 
Just one question - what are the tar.gz files in the same location and how are they to be used ? 
Thanks again!]]></description>
