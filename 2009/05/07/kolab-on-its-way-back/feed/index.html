		<description><![CDATA[Hi Shrenik,

there is not something specific you can do to fast track kolab, at least as far as I can remember.  Perhaps you can join the kolab-devel and kolab-users list, as problems about kolab on openSUSE are discussed there.  Best thing you can do now is to test kolab on openSUSE intensively, especially the initial install (via zypper and yast), and to test the kolab freebusy functionality.  It would also be good to test the webclient.

Looking forward to your contribution!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Richard,

That&#039;s great news. Will help with whatever I can to fast-track this. I have missing Kolab for a long time now as my architecture moved over to 10.3 and further.

Cheers,
Shrenik]]></description>

Do let me know if I there are any specific tasks listed apart from the usual testing and reporting bugs. May be I can be of some help.
