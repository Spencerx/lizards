		<description><![CDATA[This is a terrible interface. As far as I can tell, gnome shell is nothing but a standard application launcher (not unlike KDE&#039;s application launcher). The problem: instead of clicking on an on-screen menu, the user will now have to endure cpu-hogging, desktop reshaping animations (scale + expo!) just to get to the stupid menu. KDE 4 seems like a paragon of engineering elegance compared to this.

There is no UI innovation here: just a bunch of unnecessary &quot;gee-whiz&quot; animations thrown on top of an old-fashioned launcher.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gnome shell is terrible and a huge step backwards. It&#039;s a &#039;solution&#039; looking for a &#039;problem&#039;. This is just desperate Gnome devs looking to add some &#039;excitement&#039; to Gnome to compete with KDE4, but you can tell they don&#039;t have any real ideas.

It&#039;s a shame they are wasting their time on this nonsense when there is so much that could be fixed in the existing version (including many well documented bugs that go back 6 or 7 years and which STILL have not been fixed even though patched have been provided).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is nothing more than a _shiny_ rework of the old interface.  I doubt anyone will find anything to say &#039;WOW&#039; over.  I think it is a great improvement, it just adds a fluid feel, easier ways to access programs and data; really this is just old GNOME, well maybe a little prettier and a little easier to use.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m quite afraid of it.

I seems that it will be much harder and slower to run any application.
Application menu in Gnome2 is still, doesn&#039;t change much, so I know where the application is and can it start quite quickly. 

But Gnome shell? I have to remember the name of app, write some letters, read results, find the appropriate one and run it. Looks like looong way.

It will be nice when Gnome Shell added to current Application menu.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bernhard:

if you install the packages that Vincent packaged, open a console and run &quot;gnome-shell&quot; - it&#039;ll open in a nested window.

And yeah, hopefully someone can run usability tests on it with real people because it does need some work - of course, it&#039;s not in GNOME 3 environment yet, and it&#039;s pretty much pre-alpha at this point.]]></description>
