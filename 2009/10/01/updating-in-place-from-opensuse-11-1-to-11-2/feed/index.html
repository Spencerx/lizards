		<description><![CDATA[I followed the instructions and now the /etc/SuSE-release reads:
openSUSE 11.3 (x86_64)
VERSION = 11.3

Did I do something wrong? How can I downgrade to 11.2 ?

I now can&#039;t get OpenOffice to work. From the opensuse repos:
% ooffice 
[Java framework] Error in function createSettingsDocument (elements.cxx).
javaldx failed! 
The application cannot be started. 
The component manager is not available.
terminate called after throwing an instance of &#039;com::sun::star::uno::RuntimeException&#039;

If I use the OO from the OO.org website then I can&#039;t get it
to recognize a JRE via the Extra -&#062; Options menu. 

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I run OpenSUSE 11.1 as our backup server and it&#039;s rock solid, but I have to admit...it&#039;s processes like this that probably keep Linux (all distros) from being more popular.

Brilliant people contribute to these these operating systems. Surely there can be a simpler way.

		<description><![CDATA[Had some problems doing the CLI &quot;zypper dup -d&quot; method on an IBM R52 laptop which had been configured with a totally clean install of 11.1.

After the update completed, there was no keyboard nor mouse functionality at runlevel 5; the keyboard worked fine at runlevel 3 though.  Log reviews and Google led me to install the hal rpm from http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Base:/System/openSUSE_Factory/i586/hal-0.5.13-20.2.i586.rpm, and after a reboot all was well.

This issue was a little worrying to fix because I had to change Ethernet management from NetworkManager to Traditional (ifup) via YaST to be able to download the hal rpm (a USB stick with the rpm wasn&#039;t seen by the system), and to do that YaST wanted to install additional packages -- packages that were only available via downloading over Ethernet...  I told YaST to skip those packages and fortunately eth0 successfully got a DHCP lease.

The three other issues after the upgrade completed and hal was fixed are minor:

First, the Sonar icon theme wasn&#039;t installed, so when I went to select the new 11.2 default theme in GNOME, Control Panel threw a warning that things wouldn&#039;t look right because Sonar icons weren&#039;t installed.  After installing the icons theme via YaST, the problem went away.

Second, my hard disk started churning like crazy and running top showed that Beagle was indexing everything.  Under 11.1, I had removed Beagle and just retained the Beagle libraries.  The 11.2 upgrade installed Beagle because F-Spot now depends on Beagle, not just Beagle&#039;s libraries.  I had thought that Beagle was disabled by default under 11.2.  Next is for me to figure out how to disable Beagle with it installed, instead of disabling it by removing it.

Third, YaST&#039;s Software Management module doesn&#039;t seem to respect repo priority numbers any more.  I added the OpenOffice.org STABLE repository and gave it a priority of 95, but YaST still offers the 11.2 base OpenOffice.org packages as the preferred versions.

At the end of the day, for an upgrade with so many big under-the-hood changes, I was very impressed that I didn&#039;t have more serious issues.  GNOME 2.28 seems noticeably &quot;zippier&quot; than 2.24, and for all the work I know went in to this release, I just wanted to say &quot;thanks! to everyone on the SuSE team and all of the other who contributed to this outstanding release.

Hope that helps,
Mark

		<description><![CDATA[It is not recommended to &quot;use the system&quot; while running &lt;code&gt;zypper dup&lt;/code&gt;.  Esp. big packages with modules or plug-ins such as GNU Emacs or Firefox may fail during operation and data loss may happen (even if unlikely).  Thus, using the system in a read-only fashion is probably possible, but be warned.
