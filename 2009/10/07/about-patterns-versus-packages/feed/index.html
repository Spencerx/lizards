The system uses half the memory and boots much faster than with KDE4. Many thanks for working on KDE:KDE3!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This news looks like a &quot;welcome to the wonderful world of meta packages&quot; which are available for Debian and Fedora based Distributions since a really long time now. 

The question for me is: is a pattern simply a meta package requiring other packages/patterns? 

In this case, it might be a good decision to follow the way of other distributions and use meta-packages for that. 

But I can imagine other things, that could be covered via patterns - especially during installation. What about a pattern not only requiring packages but also telling YaST: &quot;If the user selects me, please run the following application afterwards&quot;. Think about &quot;Start the YaST2 webserver module if a user selects the &#039;webserver&#039; pattern&quot; as simple case. If it&#039;s YaST module, it could be integrated in the normal installation workflow as example. This could obsolete the installation.xml file needed to &quot;patch&quot; the control.xml (the file which controls the installation workflow) for add-ons and allow users to modify their installation even before the first package is installed.

Is this an idea that&#039;s worth working on?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Stephan,

I finally discovered the patterns packages today after an update again the new upstream of the Factory repository and I found the idea behind very interesting. The single problem I faced with their introduction is that selecting a pattern means installing automatically not desired packages as well ( a desktop user would like avoiding the installation of beagle due to its high resource consumption).

I suggest the usage of the patterns at a lower level in the particular case of the desktop environments allowing a more restrictive selection of packages according to their general purpose; Development, Multimedia, Games, Internet etc. Maybe this is a nonsense but I am committed as a user to contribute to the development of our beloved openSUSE Linux with ideas like this,

Thanks a lot to all of you for the job you are doing. Have a nice evening and a lot of fun ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Stephan,

As a member of the openSUSE development team, do you think that KDE4 is as of today mature enough to replace KDE3 in our favorite distribution? I am using the repository of the OBS and I sill find there newer packages in the folder openSUSE_Factory. I know that KDE3 will not find the way in the next release of the distribution but this is obviously not the case in the OBS. So, what do you meant with absence of maintenance?

I will give you now my opinion about the future releases of openSUSE Linux: With all the respect due to the development team and the KDE team, we are going to wait very long for a rock-solid openSUSE without KDE3 as the default desktop.

Anyway openSUSE Linux is unbreakable. Have a nice evening and a lot of fun ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi gentleman,

I did not understand very well the explanation you gave about patterns, but I noticed that since release 4.3.1 of KDE there is a problem of co-existence between packages of KDE4 and KDE3. Under KDE3 I do not see anymore the categories of applications in the kickoff and whenever I launch Kcontrol or Kinfo the same phenomenon occurs.

What do you think about that?

Thanks in advance for providing the users with useful technical informations about the changes in system management.

Have a lot of fun]]></description>
