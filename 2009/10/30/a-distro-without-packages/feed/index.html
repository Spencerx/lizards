		<description><![CDATA[I saw the problem recently in the PulseAudio ML: https://tango.0pointer.de/pipermail/pulseaudio-discuss/2009-October/005251.html but somehow I forgot (since there is still no KDE mixer for PulseAudio I lost interest...)

Note that openal-soft upstream doesn&#039;t uses PA, so they aren&#039;t going to fix it. The message was never answered in the PulseAudio ML, so don&#039;t count too much in this side neither. If it&#039;s going to be fixed Debian is the best we got.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that might explain my testing success (un-success!) of alien arena on 11.2. I was actually trying to haunt down a crash that was reported (and I could reproduce). As soon as I could fix the crash (alien arena dlopens() the .so file and badly segfaults if that does not work), it just hangs after &#039;initializing sound&#039;... might very well be linked. (That would actually be bnc#544227)]]></description>
