		<description><![CDATA[Yes, you are right there is a user management in Webmin. That was my fault.
BUT have a look to there homepage: http://doxfer.com/Webmin/WebminUsers
As far I have understood Webmin is still running with root privileges:

&quot;Because Webmin still runs with full root privileges even when used by a restricted user, it still has access to all the configuration files and commands that it needs.&quot;

Due that they are not really convinced about that concept:

&quot;You must be very careful when granting access to un-trusted Webmin users though, as even a small mistake in the access control configuration may allow the user to edit arbitrary files on your system or run commands as root. All it takes is a small hole for an attacker to sneak through and take total control of your system. Webmin&#039;s access control capabilities give you the power to lock down users, but only if used properly.&quot;

So Webmin has the same problem as YaST: The complete application runs with root privileges. So from the security side this is horrible and will be not 
useful for a server product. That&#039;s why we have not gone that way in YaST and that&#039;s the reason why YaST does not have a user management.

Since the combination of pam,policyKit and DBUS we have the chance to close that gap.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; no user management and right access management.

Sorry, this is wrong since at least the year 2001. Webmin allows to define users and groups as known on Unix/Linux machines. These users/groups can get &quot;acls&quot; depending on the implementation in the used modules. 

So - for example - it&#039;s already possible with webmin to define a &quot;usermanager&quot; group, which is allowed to manage users on a machine, and add users to this group. It&#039;s even possible to allow just to add users instead of deleting or modifying existing ones. 

From this point of view, webmin is very useful for server products as it allows a fine granulary access management for each module (and even the submodules) - more useful than YaST in it&#039;s current state.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Christopher.

That is why there is a web service and a web client.

On the desktop side the need is not that big like in the appliance market. Your own router usually requires turning it on and accessing it via a web browser to setup the basic stuff. People running appliances expect more or less the same.

However, on the desktop side, having a web service allows applications, scripts and frontends to use simple http requests to get and set configuration (the web client is actually that, a very thin application doing http get&#039;s and post&#039;s to the service), while YaST retains all the business logic, and in a secure manner. This opens a new door to the community. You can use http from any language/platform out there.]]></description>

webmin is well a know administration tool for experts and NOT for &quot;normal&quot; users.

		<description><![CDATA[While I appreciate the development, I&#039;m not sure how much I dig this idea.  I like YaST as it stands, but I don&#039;t see a huge need for YaST web services.

I suppose that as long as it doesn&#039;t run on startup out of the box, it wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea.  It&#039;s always good to give people options.

You&#039;ve made some real progress here, keep up the great work!]]></description>
