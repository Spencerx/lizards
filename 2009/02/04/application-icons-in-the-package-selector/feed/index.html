		<description><![CDATA[I want to explain some technical details:

The package selector uses .desktop files for this feature. It searches the file list for .desktop files and extracts the Name and Icon attributes. It translates the name to the user&#039;s language and searches for the appropriate icons. 

The .desktop file contains an Exec attribute as well. Therefore the package selector knows the binary to run. I think it would be nice to start the application when the user clicks the icon. Technically it is possible to find out whom the display belongs and to run the application via sudo.  Unfortunately security concerns forbid such ugly and insecure constructions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess some users might be confused when they use an application and save data but can&#039;t find it again afterwards. Think of someone who starts a word processor from the package selector and writes his doctor theses, saves the document and closes the application. If he starts searches for the document he cannot find it because it belongs a different user.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where are you getting the application information from? Afaik rpm-md doesn&#039;t contain it. Or is this only for installed packages?

It would be nice to automatically obtain the icons for applications on software portal too.]]></description>
