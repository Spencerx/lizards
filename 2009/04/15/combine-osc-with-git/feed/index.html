		<description><![CDATA[Yes, you&#039;re right. osc log and osc diff are commandline Tools. I would like to see it clean like gitk. There i have an good overview. The present GUI&#039;s are not working for me. MonoOSC is on my PC not for daily working. YABSC at the Moment not runs. I&#039;m searchin for an Solution. So all in all the combine from osc and git is for the best Solution. And with git is an application possible, for example an monitoring of /etc or other locations. So i can use git for more than one Application.]]></description>
