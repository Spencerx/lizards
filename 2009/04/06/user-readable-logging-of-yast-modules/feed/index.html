		<description><![CDATA[There are some contradicting wishes in the comments above, IMHO:

- 3rd version is understandable, while 2nd version is too much technical
- let&#039;s log exact commands in the log (which is closer to 2nd version)

So, what exactly you don&#039;t like in that 2nd version (which is logging the commands)? Do you think the diffs make it too technical?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[IMHO the most important part is to show the exact commands used (exact as in copying the commands from the log and executing them in a console has to lead to the same result) since that&#039;s pretty much what that logging is good for (otherwise the normal log is good enough).

This way people can easily learn how to do something manually in a console by simply monitoring the log while doing stuff in Yast.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You may want to consider enclosing commands (system calls) in square brackets, to distinguish them from file I/O operations and to prevent issues with command lines that may already contain quotes and parenthesis.  Example:

2009-02-09 11:05:49 rivendell File Written: &#039;/tmp/pre-install.sh&#039;
2009-02-09 11:05:49 rivendell Executing: [ /tmp/pre-install.sh ]

It makes finding the commands in a sea of log file lines a bit easier - especially for scripts that scan those files.  The added pre and post spaces are just make it a bit easier to &#039;cut-n-paste&#039; those commands, if needed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking as a user the third version is definitely the most readable and understandable. I do agree with the comment from Andre that adding the actual command that deoes the action would be valuable. And certainly a great learning tool. Version 2 is getting very technical again and becomong difficult to follow. Remember the whole idea here is for a standard user to be able to read and understand the log. 

Great work so far. Keep it up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; I agree but I would like to see the command mentioned, the user has used to do the stuff.

This is what you can see in the second variant (with the diffs):

2009-02-09 11:05:49  rivendell Home directory moved: â€˜/bin/mv /local/home/bb /local/home/aaâ€™

I wanted to write that the last option (with &quot;UI info&quot;) is not really usable]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I think the last method is getting more talkative and actually is not more helpful.&quot;

Like 
2009-02-06 15:54:11  rivendell (UI info) User â€˜bbâ€™ renamed to â€˜aaâ€™ (mv &#039;bb&#039; &#039;aa&#039;)

Just to have the chance to learn more about the commandline.]]></description>
