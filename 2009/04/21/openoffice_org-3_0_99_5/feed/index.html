		<description><![CDATA[It is just a naming scheme. Upstream does not use beta versions. It provides just so-called milestone builds. I think that alpha, beta, rc names are more descriptive and more tell about the quality. Release candidate should not contain any known blocker bug. The openSUSE build is delayed by few days after the upstream by definition. The openSUSE beta5 build was based on the upstream 3.1-rc1 sources but I didn&#039;t want to mark it as rc1 because I already know about the other blocker bugs =&#062; I used another beta version number in the row for it.

BTW: The upstream OOo-3.1-rc1 was released 3 weeks ago. They added 30-50 fixes within the last 3 weeks. I think that the name beta was better description.

Another problem is that the openSUSE build is not based on the pure upstream sources. It is based on the GO-oo sources. There are many changes. The GO-oo developers do their best to be in sync with the upstream schedule but it is not always possible. Upstream often delays releases be several weeks. It is normal that this happen also in the GO-oo project with its additional features and fixes.

In each case, feel free to help us to deliver the packages on time. The GO-oo developers are still looking for more helping hands. Also I am looking for a co-packager ;-)]]></description>
