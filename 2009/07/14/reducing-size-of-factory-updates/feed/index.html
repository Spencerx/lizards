		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t comment for the HackWeek, please recheck your spam protection !!

I&#039;ll put it here :

Very nice news.

this a very good idea to let people do what they want during a week.
But it needs more info about the event inside SUSE labs to see how people think and work.

launching a website specially for hackweeks where you post photos and some videos, looks for me a good idea.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, that&#039;s discussed in the feature as well but not done yet.  It reduces download but AFAIK it increases installation time.  Depending on the size of your download pipe and the delta, it might be a significant improvement.]]></description>
