		<description><![CDATA[&#062; I don’t think doxygen is handled, any fixes for that are welcome

Doxygen was not handled, because it was changed my maintainer to not produce a footers with timestamps by default:

$ rpm -q --changelog doxygen
* Mon Jun 22 2009 mseben@suse.cz
- Changed default behavior ! :
  added modify_footer.patch (bnc#489947), which disable text
  in footer by default, you could enable this text with option
  HTML_FOOTER_DESCRIPTION = YES, this feature was added due to
  increasing efficiency of build buildservice

But I suppose that this is not a correct way how to do it and it should be changed in a future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[po files are already handled.  I don&#039;t think doxygen is handled, any fixes for that are welcome.  Timestamps are one problem - hashes and temporary files are another.  

Btw. have a look at the logfiles of your packages  in openSUSE:Factory whether they compared identical or not.

build-compare runs in the chroot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice job, really. Another part is a documentation generated by doxygen, or po files, but I expect that maintainer(s) turned off the timestamps by default in openSUSE to disallow those rebuildings.

Does the build-compare works in a build root, or somewhere else? Because if not you&#039;d like to use a fastjar, instead of jar. The command syntax is the same, but fastjar don&#039;t need a JVM for work. And it should be faster than jar.]]></description>
