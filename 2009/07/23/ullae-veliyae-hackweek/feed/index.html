		<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt;
Graphs for CPU % per process was the easter egg, which now has been refined and made as a known functionality.

RPM: &lt;a href=&quot;http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home://nikanth/openSUSE_11.1/noarch/ullae-veliyae-1.0-13.1.noarch.rpm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home://nikanth/openSUSE_11.1/noarch/ullae-veliyae-1.0-13.1.noarch.rpm&lt;/a&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[AFAIK gnome-system-monitor won&#039;t show you graph for per-process data. It would only show a &#039;top&#039; like list only in words. So it is difficult to see the big picture including some history.

Moreover, this was done just for fun, and didn&#039;t intend to become a serious tool. And at times, I do want to see graphs for this kind of data.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good job. Well done. congrats. 

Apart from those managerial words ;-), I really felt it is useful and a wonderful tool. It reminded me a little about iogrind, iotop etc. A nice graphical tool is always helpful. May be you can get this integrated with gnome-system-monitor or some such tool as well.]]></description>
