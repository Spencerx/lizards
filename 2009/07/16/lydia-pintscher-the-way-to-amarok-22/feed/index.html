		<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t agree more! Those widgets annoyed the living daylights out of me each and everytime I tried amarok. I just want my collection to be shown in a long list (which I can sort) and the ability to create playlists and enqueue files. Unfortunately that seems to be just about impossible in amarok 2 so far. That&#039;s why I&#039;ve switched to banshee and songbird and the likes, even though I would love to have a nice, well integrated, kde4 media player...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That last picture, that&#039;s the Amarok I want! No space eating widget thingy, just the collection and the sortable playlist. Navigation on the bottom and finally no freaking overlapping buttons anymore. Yay, go 2.2!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What leo said.

Also, one important thing to note (if you try out current Git, and unless someone fixes it 2.2) is that the Collection Browser sometimes goes a bit loopy in terms of the tracks it&#039;s showing, but that this is not reflective of the problems in the database (which should already be fixed).

The way you can tell is easy -- if you close Amarok and reopen it and the problem goes away, it&#039;s the Collection Browser being messy. If the problem doesn&#039;t go away, then something may still be wrong with the collection stuff that I fixed.

You may want to look at the following:
