		<description><![CDATA[Yes you are right in saying that the manpage states that, and in fact those two scripts belong to different stages. The stage of the lvm2 symlink is moved. At least those two scripts are both the only ones in their respective stage, so there shouldn&#039;t be many side effects except for each other.

I&#039;ll investigate this further, but not until in about two weeks, also not until I compared it with factory&#039;s progress on this. I think there are already enough bugs and feature request for this particular feature. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting read. According to man 5 initrd your solution is not
possible though :) boot-luks and boot-lvm2 are in different stages
so the order between the two is fixed. However if I understand it
correctly all we need is a vgchange call in boot-luks, right? Would
oyu mind opening a bug for that?]]></description>
