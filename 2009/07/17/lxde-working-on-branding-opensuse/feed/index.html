		<description><![CDATA[Hi Denny.

i&#039;m testing your last build, you did a great job, i found a couple of issues i think easy to fix.

any way, will be my pleasure to have you in our LXDE team, what do you think about it?

i&#039;m still not able to have slim autologin working, but the package i&#039;m working on, provides an init 5 starting script plus an &quot;openSUSE&quot; theme.

let me know if are interested to join your forces to us (your live cd with some improvments may become the official LXDE openSUSE based live cd) ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi Andrea,

i use lxde a lot. in fact, i setup few guides for lxde minimal install on few distros here:
http://wiki.dennyhalim.com/linux-minimal-desktop

and i also build lxde livecd using suse studio. 
i choose a blue theme for my livecd, so that logo suites my theme.

imho, the major problem i have working with lxde is that the shutdown/reboot/etc need gdm to work correctly.
and gdm is very big and does not suite the idea of lightning fast lxde.
it&#039;s like a horse dragging an elephant...

so...
if i may suggest.
first thing to do is make shutdown/reboot/etc works without gdm.
use xdm/slim or even qingy. anything but gdm/kdm or other elephants...

currently, i&#039;m using mingetty autologin combine with .bashrc to automatically startx.

rgds,
dny]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes you are right, i notice that one hour ago :P the cutted image is already in obs, and obs build is running on my pc right now ;)

This is IMHO just a workaround any way, i really believe that we need a more custom branding, so if any of you wants to help us, well you are welcome.

@Pavol.

p.s. if you some minutes, can you check X11:lxde failure and try to fix them? (all gcc post build checks)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Andrea! Haven&#039;t you noticed that the original logout banner is actually cropped 352x125 region from the blue wallpaper? :) I prepared the green logout banner by cutting the rectangle from the green wallpaper you seem to be using. You can download it here: http://gk2.sk/_tmp/logout-banner-green.png

But if someone is willing to create the unique openSUSE LXDE wallpaper and logout banner, it would be even more great!]]></description>
