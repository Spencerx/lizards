		<description><![CDATA[Efstathios:

Thank you for the great article.  I would like to point out an alternative mechanism to schedule fstrim (#6).  The util-linux package has a systemd timer in it for fstrim [1].  It is relatively new, so it may not be an option in all versions but it is available in openSUSE 13.2.

All that is required for for the timer be enabled and active with systemctl is:
$ systemctl enable fstrim.timer
$ systemctl start fstrim.timer

		<description><![CDATA[First keeping a small swap partition is still recommended for performance usage.
relatime is still a good choice as explained in previous comment
Removing swap partition kill automatically the hibernation possibility.
Your log in tmpfs good be and idea, but if there&#039;s a problem it will be hard to diagnose whatever.

And you forget to add the most advisable idea : check and apply any mfg recommended firmware!
Mfg have fixed numerous crash or prematurely dying ssd during the last few years.

Before buying an ssd, try to discover (often hidden informations) the limit of write the model propose. You could be surpized :-) Some are good, other really bad. The last Samsung 850 1To for example wouldn&#039;t survive 1.5 year at the pace I use my laptop... Crucial M550 or older Corsair GT3 doesn&#039;t seems to suffer....

My last advise is also the following, if you use encryption luks over your ssd, by default there&#039;s no trim/discard available by default on openSUSE. Be it a good idea for security, cause empty blocks will never get aligned, I&#039;m still not sure it is a good or wise default for ssd.

In my case, every 1.5 years I totally secure erase the ssd, and restore my system on them afterwards.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello: 

I think that some applications need to take into account the changes that occur in their files.

If it gets &#039;noatime&#039; changes in the inode is not going to produce, but if we put realtime, change only if the file is changed, if it is not, It would behave like noatime ; i think that for applications that need to be on the basis of the dates and the access time of files, i think that realtime is a better option.

Even i do not know many of the improvements that can bring btrfs in configurations of SSD drives; but I think that these are some, To be able to rid some of the changes that are made in EXT4; by now not know them, but my fstab configuration for an SSD in BTRFS, that used for tests with VirtualBox is this:

UUID d8c57867-8bad-41DB-85CF-219b41Eddd22 /home/frank/VBox_ssd btrfs discard realtime ssd 0 0

Thank you for your article .

I look forward to reading more about this topic.

Greetings

		<description><![CDATA[and after all to care of ssd you can move it from your system
or remove your os 
or turn down your ssytem forever
and be sure your ssd never be die ;)
disable hibernate not good...
disable  cahce not good...
only make cache lower and slower...
vm.swappiness=1 is good for example]]></description>
