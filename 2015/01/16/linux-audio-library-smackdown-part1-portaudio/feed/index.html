		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for kind words. First my idea was to get Pulseaudio blog out but because of life Portaudio was first in line. In Pulseaudio blog there gonna be little light for how Pulseaudio live upon Alsa and OSS. So if I have time I&#039;m going to draw small image but if not seek some from net ;)
But currently path from Portaudio (if you have Pulseaudio and ALSA-Pulseaudio driver) is &lt;strong&gt;Portaudio&lt;/strong&gt;&#8594;&lt;strong&gt;ALSA-API&lt;/strong&gt;&#8594;&lt;strong&gt;ALSA-Pulseaudio-drv&lt;/strong&gt;&#8594;&lt;strong&gt;Pulseaudio&lt;/strong&gt;&#8594;&lt;strong&gt;ALSA-output&lt;/strong&gt; and without Pulseaudio it&#039;s &lt;strong&gt;Portaudio&lt;/strong&gt;&#8594;&lt;strong&gt;ALSA-output&lt;/strong&gt;.]]></description>

But currently path from Portaudio (if you have Pulseaudio and ALSA-Pulseaudio driver) is <strong>Portaudio</strong>&rarr;<strong>ALSA-API</strong>&rarr;<strong>ALSA-Pulseaudio-drv</strong>&rarr;<strong>Pulseaudio</strong>&rarr;<strong>ALSA-output</strong> and without Pulseaudio it&#8217;s <strong>Portaudio</strong>&rarr;<strong>ALSA-output</strong>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

It&#039;s good to see such work. Audio APIs always were a mystery to me.

I&#039;d be thankful if you could make an article describing in general what are alsa, oss, portaudio, pulseaudio, gstreamer, etc. what are their tasks and abilities and how they are related to each other.

Also a good thing to explain would be: If I have an app that uses portaudio, which supports and uses pulseaudio, what is the path between my app and soundcard?

Can&#039;t wait for next parts. Good job! :)]]></description>
