		<description><![CDATA[I would add to this excellent réflexion the following.
We have actually 147 casts on a total of 574 registered members.

For sure some of them as time past, are not more concerned by openSUSE. We have a lack in our Guideline / Principals and Members rules. We can&#039;t unsubscribed to this group.

What is the result? We don&#039;t know who we are, nor have a clear vision of how much interested by the community are still concerned.

Look like it&#039;s the time to propose a &quot;Membership 2.0&quot; revision. We have to fix not only failing building package. but also failing part of the community.

Btw the end line is today 23:59 UTC - so still time to vote]]></description>
