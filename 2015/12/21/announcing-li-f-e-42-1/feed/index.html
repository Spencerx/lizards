		<description><![CDATA[If you follow the screenshots you&#039;d see the applications included, Shorter list: https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e and for more comprehensive list follow the link mentioned in the post: http://download.opensuse-education.org/~cyberorg/opensuse-edu-life-4211-packages.txt

It would be easier to boot up the iso in a VM if you wish to do a detailed comparison with other distributions.

Li-f-e is all about playing and learning in whatever order you prefer :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[By the way, I have forgotten one thing about Li-f-e(Linux for Education):
In the above images, you put first Games, Development and Graphics before Learning.

I hope, it&#039;s just an end of the year joke!

Li-f-e(Linux for Education) is first about Learning / Education! Isn&#039;t it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Li-f-e 42.1,

You wrote:
&quot;This release includes carefully selected software for students, educators as well as parents. The software selection encompasses everything required to make computers productive for either home or educational use without having to install anything additional.&quot;

Well, these are for generalities.
What about a specific list of selected education software, which student age ranges are you addressing, how the softwares are organized by age range - by level (which ones) or not at all, localization, etc...

In fact, the basic information anyone needs for understanding what Li-f-e 42.1 is or is not and making it possible to compare it to other GNU/Linux distributions specialized in Education.

Thanks. Cheers,
Joe]]></description>
