		<description><![CDATA[If you start zippl this way:
  zippl /usr/share/zippl/zippl.xml
it comes up with a demo presentation.

/usr/share/zippl/zippl.xml from the package should also give you an idea how to write your own presentation. Documentation is still missing :-(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Klass, too nice to see your post, just in time when I ask myself about Prezi.
I&#039;ve install zippl under factory from your repo. but when I launch it, i want to open a file, not create a new one ? 
Did I miss something ? You know how long is the README :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a question, since often I need to look at a different screen than the presentation, how does Zippl handle dual screen setups?

Ideally you would see the whole canvas on the laptop screen, and it can have a &quot;view finder&quot; that selects what&#039;s shown on the external screen. I&#039;m a total newb about QGraphicsView, but is that possible with it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great, thanks Klaas. Another feature that would be great, would be the ability to get back to focus after one have zoomed out (using the - key). If you press + atm it zooms in back to the canvas, of course, but zippl does not focus a slide, so you have to move around to find one.

I think about an option like pressing f which would focus the nearest object found.
