		<description><![CDATA[I hope it will all look the same again. I hate it that it looks different in GNOME then it does in KDE already.

It is a pain to tell people where to go when it is different from what you have.
Also dislike the fact that when I click on e.g. Software I still see all the other icons.

And please no two different layouts. One for installation and one for installed systems? Please no.

I would love to see some added functionality during installation. e.g. being able to browse the internet (and look for solutions for install problems) Most of the time the network is already up and running and ssh is possible on console. Having a minimal browser available would be handy and something you can do something with while the system installs itself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to totally agree with gaboo. What would you say if all the other applications out there would do the same thing? Holy moly!
Honestly, you can&#039;t be serious about that. Maybe you should ask some useability expert - I think I know what he&#039;s gonna say ...

At least, could you give us the choice to not use that css thingy?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YaST uses the same button order as the current desktop. In KDE it&#039;s [Yes],[No]. Gnome uses [No], [Yes]. Wizards always use [Back], [Next], [Finish]. The users modules from the screenshot uses the layout of a wizard dialog. This leads to this unusual button order.

There was a discussion about the button order in wizard dialogs. See: http://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/2011-08/msg00050.html

More details on the button order:

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your improvements of YaST. 
Nice, well integrated layouts are very nice. YaST always had a different style compared to the other applications. So more flexibility on this side is great.
Another small thing: You can see it on your screen shot that &quot;OK/Yes&quot; button sometimes is on the left side (like in KDE Software) and sometimes right (like in GNOME). Perhaps you find some time to have a look at this one, too.

Great work.

		<description><![CDATA[If something is clear from the past, features nobody anticipates can open unexpected possibilities and interesting use cases. Admittedly not the same field, but who would have seen any use for cameras in mobile phones 10 years ago?

I don&#039;t know how far the Qt Stylesheets support goes, but I wonder whether it would be possible to also have a company logo incorporated in the styles.]]></description>
