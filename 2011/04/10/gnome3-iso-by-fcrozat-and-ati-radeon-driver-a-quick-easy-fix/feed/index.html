		<description><![CDATA[On Apr 27 11 the fglrx module version 11.4 was published.  On a 64bit instance (thinkpad w500), the Gnome bar is still a bit funky in that little incons in the bar look wrong in &quot;non-mouse-over&quot; state.  Other than that, it seems to be working.  I tried the idea above using dynpm instead of low and that wasn&#039;t enough savings.   So it looks like there are two work-arounds available and you can decide which works better for you until the open source driver is fixed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got a laptop with an ATI chipset. I tried GNOME 3 with the ATI driver but even with the anti-tearing option selected in the ATI tools, the tearing was unacceptable. However, this particular laptop seems to function just fine with the open source &quot;radeon&quot; driver - it&#039;s a fairly old chip set. So if I can get all the gnome-shell 2.91 magic to work on it, I&#039;ll post the details here.]]></description>
