		<description><![CDATA[Sorry. But in my opinion this numbering scheme is stupid. It *COULD* still be cool though if you REALLY did the hybrid &quot;versioning&quot; of year.version combinations. This could easily be realized by using 12.1 for the March Release in 2012, so one more 11 version ahead.
In that way the leading number would incidentally also represent the year of the release and the second number would represent the number of the release of that year. Therefore...

12.1 - March 2012
12.2 - July 2012
12.3 - Novermber 2010
13.1 - March 2013
... and so on.

What do you think? Would make sense I would say.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I must say I&#039;m surprised. People are probably used to weird version number systems by now (they seem to be able to handle Ubuntu&#039;s after all), but this one&#039;s not connected to anything at all! Well, other than to history anyway. I really thought either year.number or a single number would win out.

Still, I didn&#039;t get to vote in the final poll, and whatever the version number is I&#039;m sure OpenSUSE will still be awesome.]]></description>
