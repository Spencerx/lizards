		<description><![CDATA[While the mockup looks cool, I think it would be a better idea to put YaST in the status menu in the top-right corner, either close to System Settings or replacing it. Putting individual system administration tools in there while GNOME3 chose to depart from that with their control center might not be the best idea.
The Windows-systemsettings-like structure of YaST was always something I liked, and I think an additional tab in the Shell for YaST would just be confusing.

Integrating YaST tools in the GNOME control center would be a cool solution as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did wonder how Yast might change with Gnome 3. I&#039;m running it from the OBS build now, and there is a bit of overlap and some unused functionality. It&#039;d be good to keep the power of Yast while integrating better with Gnome 3.

I quite like the idea, but I also like Yast turning up in the Apps. I guess if the main Yast app remains then it&#039;ll still be there, and the extra Yast section in the Activities launcher (or whatever it is called) will just be a more direct jump.]]></description>
