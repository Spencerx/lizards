		<description><![CDATA[Personally, I dislike Facebook on several levels.


From there to &quot;this is what happens when you trust a company&quot; there is a mile. 

So, when a fellow human being screws you over, you deduce &quot;this is what happens when you trust humans&quot;? When a plumber does not do his job to your satisfaction, you dismiss the whole species? Race? Color? Nationality?

This is what you get when you trust people named Will ;-)


1) RELAX, if you are entrusted with a megaphone, your responsibility is to use it to improve the environment, not rant.

2) Appeal. Facebook has a large staff handling that thanks to ill-formed laws like the DMCA. If you use a civil tone, they will most likely help you.

3) Maybe the app ACTUALLY violated the terms. Knowing if it did or not may help your appeal (&quot;the app violated terms, but I still would like my data&quot; vs &quot;the app did not violate terms, and anyway I would like my data, could you help?&quot;)/

		<description><![CDATA[I was one of the users affected by this and I can confirm that it&#039;s working again. Apparently the KDE devs filed a bug on the Facebook developer&#039;s bugzilla. 

The only response they got was silence but they also fed the story to some tech new websites. Once that was done it wasn&#039;t long before the app was magically re-enabled.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Stumbled upon this as result of Phoronix article on Novacut.

Open Photo - Kickstarter appeal http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jmathai/openphoto-a-photo-service-for-your-s3-or-dropbox-a?ref=spotlight

Not sure what to make of this &quot;Kickstarter&quot; could be way to get projects going with donations and infrastructure and time, yet OTOH the scamware potential is huge.  Perhaps if Open Photo is legit, a KDE app could support it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, the trolling.  From what I&#039;ve seen, the Facebook KIPI plugin was violating FB&#039;s Terms of Service.  I agree that taking down the existing content is ass, but, well, them&#039;s the breaks.

Hopefully the next version of the FB KIPI plugin will be more a bit more careful about compliance, to protect users from this kind of problem.]]></description>
