		<description><![CDATA[Yes. According to Canonical&#039;s Qt/KDE guru Aurelien Gateau the required Qt patch ships with (K)Ubuntu&#039;s Qt 4.7 and was accepted by Nokia for Qt 4.8. That Qt patch + Aurelien&#039;s menu bar Plasma applet and it should work for all Qt/KDE and GNOME applications in both directions.
However so far nobody was willing or capable to provide patched Qt 4.7 + Plasma applet for openSUSE.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t covered KDE, only looking into GNOME stuff. If anyone wants to take this to KDE, go for it. About the GTK menu handling, this is done by a proxy, so far it requires 4 patches on GTK stack, but I haven&#039;t looked properly into it yet, as most of this software is under development, and my plans are to use the versions available for Natty.

One of the main reasons why this work is only being developed for 11.4/Factory is exactly because of the libnotify requirements which are only present so far in 11.4 and Factory. Libnotify &#062;= 0.5 is a must.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Weren&#039;t KDE and Ubuntu developers already working on a general menu-handling spec compatible with both gnome and KDE?  Is that what this is, or is it something else?  And how does this interact with the new notification spec?]]></description>
