		<description><![CDATA[Hello,

You have a typo in your remove command. It says &#039;flgrx&#039; where it should say &#039;fglrx&#039;.
Note the reversal of 2 letters!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi Bruno/All,

I have added the Tumbleweed repo and did the distribution upgrade.

The kernel has upgraded to 2.6.38.

Perhaps I was a little too quick, as all the fglrx drivers are for kernel 2.6.37.

I was wondering is there a way to install fglrx catalyst with 2.6.38 ?

Thanks,
Mark.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate the replies.

I hadn&#039;t thought of initrd. None the less, I restored my machine so I cannot test initrd to see if that is where fglrx is being called. Clearly though, something is still looking for fglrx even after removing the package.

Hopefully someone else will be helped by this article and the comments.

Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chris, sorry to be long to answer, I was travelling to L.A. 
(A day that takes 35 hours :-)

The Nelson &#038; Fisiu Comment should have resolved your trouble about how to get radeon back to your installation.

The only last point the uninstaller would not touch, will be the 50-device.conf file (remember the line driver fglrx ?) remove it or comment it.
So xorg at start will try all drivers it knows.

After uninstalling and be sure, you didn&#039;t get anymore the blacklist radeon line in /etc/modprode.d, and reboot in console.
Have a look at /etc/sysconfig/kernel and check you don&#039;t have that line in it
NO_KMS_IN_INITRD=&quot;yes&quot; if you have, just comment it. This will allow the module to be build in initrd.

Then rebuild the initrd with mkinitrd.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[By uninstalling the RPM the system should be back to radeon, nevertheless it&#039;s always useful to rebuild mkinitrd to make sure.

If radeon isn&#039;t loading with the RPM uninstalled, you might want to check if /etc/modprobe.d/50-fglrx.conf exists and if it&#039;s blacklisting the radeon module, which has happened to me in the past (not with this RPM though).

Hope it helps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You would think that by removing fglrx_xpic_SUSE11x one&#039;s system would revert to the OSS driver, in my case radeon. That is not the case though. During boot I can see some fglrx[...] script still running. The machine boots too fast for me to see it and I cannot pause. I do not have an xorg.conf file, nor do I have an 50-fglrx.conf file. Also, 50-device.conf does not display fglrx. Something is still trying to load fglrx.

On a personal note, I back up my system before I try any experimenting, especially with graphics drivers, so my system is fine now. I think others should be informed before trying this process.

Thanks.]]></description>
