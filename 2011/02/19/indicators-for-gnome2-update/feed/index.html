		<description><![CDATA[Ok, I&#039;ve made a new install and used the 1-Click installer with the procedures I&#039;ve told you and I was able to duplicate the bug. This bug is of human origin, and I&#039;m the one to blame for it ;)

I&#039;ve added the gsettings schema macros to the RPM and it&#039;s rebuilding at the moment.

I&#039;ve also removed gnome-session from the repository, as it was making GNOME3 default login instead of GNOME2. I&#039;m going to work this out and submit a fixed version still today.

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t get that behavior, but I&#039;ve disabled all the apps except the nm-applet (NetworkManager-gnome). I know some applets used to trigger weird effects alongside with some gnome-applets.

I&#039;m finishing some other stuff meanwhile, mainly a small guide for the openSUSE wiki, and will provide a more extensive tutorial on how to disable some applets. In the meanwhile I&#039;ll try to figure which applets might be triggering those effects.

		<description><![CDATA[Jorge,

We are shipping Banshee 1.8.0, therefore I&#039;m using that extension. After 11.4 release, I will provide the dependencies to Factory so that Banshee team can enable the core functionality for 1.9.x (sound menu integration), and enable libappindicator on banshee-community-extensions. For the time being since those dependencies aren&#039;t provided by Factory, I&#039;ve made those two available.

		<description><![CDATA[banshee-extension-indicator was what we shipped in Ubuntu before Banshee had SoundMenu/MPRIS support so you can probably drop it. 

Are you sure this indicator is what has the notification support because I don&#039;t have it installed and I get notifications from Banshee.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You will need openSUSE 11.4 RC1 or Factory. I would advice a clean install from the GNOME LiveCD.

After install update the system, download and open this file[1]. This should pop YaST software installer and it&#039;s just following up the instructions. This operation also installs this repository, which is good.

Next step is opening YaST, select &quot;Software Repositories&quot; and give the test repository a higher priority over all the others. This is required so that you can install our modified software (gtk2, gdk-pixbuf, metacity, empathy, etc... some of those packages the installer already installs them, but not the most important, gtk2 and gdk-pixbuf). A higher priority repo will have a lower number, so make sure this repository has lowest number when compared to the others.

Open a terminal, become root (ex: su) and run zypper dup. On a clean install this is actually easy and a few packages will be replaced.

Restart and then add the indicators to panel. That should pretty much do it.

I will compile more INSTALL information on the following page[2] and will keep it updated once GNOME:Ayatana is Live.

[1] - http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/ketheriel:/ayatana/openSUSE_Factory/gnome2-indicators.ymp
[2] - http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GNOME_Ayatana

Anything you can ring me on #opensuse-gnome @ Freenode (nmarques).
