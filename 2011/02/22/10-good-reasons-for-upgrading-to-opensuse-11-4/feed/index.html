		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately #7 does not work for me with RC2. I tried installations of openSuSE 11.4 with all possible options without success. It is one PC with Assus main board and Nvidia video card.
Nor x86 nor x86_64 version works. In the process of installation just when the video drivers are sensed and installed the screen get unreadable and installation could not be finished (could not interact with the software) 
Same RC2 installation works well with Intel videocard.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with the first post. The reason I fondly look forward to new releases of OpenSUSE is for the work they do with the KDE desktop.

GNOME users are spoiled for distro choice. Its good to see some KDE love coming out in each OpenSUSE release.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, in my opinion Ubuntu is the one who is trying to separate itself from the crowd, by migrating its desktop environment to Unity. I&#039;ve never tried to use Unity before, but I think it will be turned out to be good and useful, maybe not in Ubuntu 11.04 though.

		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree. But although OpenSUSE has to provide GNOME and other desktopenvironments for the fans, in the first place OpenSUSE is branding itself as a KDE specialized distribution. And that should always be the case. For ever.It&#039;s one of the main reasons OpenSUSE became my first choice.I think from a branding point of view OpenSUSE should not dive in Ubuntu&#039;s Unity mess. OpenSUSE has to make the difference.

Other important reasons for my OpenSUSE choice: very well developped for working in a productivity environment, great multimedia versatility and good iPod support.Do I use bad language now?
