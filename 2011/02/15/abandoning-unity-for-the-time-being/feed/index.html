		<description><![CDATA[Indeed. I haven&#039;t looked at it yet, though there&#039;s lots of reports from it being successfully built and implemented. Frugalware at least has it running, and I think Arch Linux also (gj guys).

I&#039;m not a KDE user, so I really dodged it for a while, but I&#039;ve seen branches from some of my packages used to deploy -qt variants of some libraries, so I&#039;m glad some work could be scrapped for KDE usage.

I&#039;ll take a look at it later on when time isn&#039;t so much critical if no one more familiarized with KDE does it first.

By the way Markus, Wine 1.3.14 has just landed here with outstanding performance ;) +1]]></description>
