		<description><![CDATA[I already submitted the survey (thanks for doing this), but had a few thoughts while doing so.

First, it would be helpful to be able to indicate which naming schemes one actively does not prefer, rather than just bumping up the preferred ones from a neutral, level playing field.  I&#039;d like to push some options below the neutral threshold.

Second, offering a *small* (twitter length?) textbox for comments might be helpful for capturing why something was preferred or not.  Once everything was laid out before me (including the very nice description of the variants), I was able to think about why I preferred one over the other.  It would be useful to state this, and to see what reasons others have for preferring something else (I may change my mind.)]]></description>
