		<description><![CDATA[The way the poll was structured, one cannot compare the numbers in the &quot;consecutive numbering&quot; poll with the numbers in the &quot;date based&quot; poll to infer an overall preference, unless you have the raw data for each individual who voted. E.g., it could be that 500 people who chose consecutive &quot;old school&quot; as their favorite also chose &quot;date-based&quot; as their favorite, which means those votes for &quot;old school&quot; shouldn&#039;t be counted as overall favorite. However, that wouldn&#039;t necessarily means that &quot;Ubuntu style&quot; would be the overall favorite: perhaps those 500 people chose other &quot;date-based&quot; styles as their favorite.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems to me date-based Ubuntu style is the winner, given that more preferred date-based rather than consecutive numbering.  (Actually, there is probably no statistical difference between which method is preferred, though without error estimates that&#039;s hard to tell).]]></description>
