		<description><![CDATA[Hi Dave,

I am sorry for the late reply. It is a pity that the system does not send any mail notifications about new comments.

Please, look at http://www.libreoffice.org/download/release-notes/. It already points to 3.3.2 release. Though, it states that the final release is bit-for-bit identical to the 3.3.2 Release Candidate 2. The same situation was also with 3.3.1 release.

The idea behind this is that the LO community does not want to release the final build without public testing. It means that it produces release candidates and when there is no blocker found, the last release candidate is marked as final.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Petr,

The document at http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/build/plain/NEWS?id=libreoffice-3.3.1.2 suggests that this is libreoffice-3.3.1.2 (3.3.1rc2)

I thought the STABLE repository was supposed to contain 3.3.1 final, as released on 23 Feb? Am I misunderstanding something here?

TIA
