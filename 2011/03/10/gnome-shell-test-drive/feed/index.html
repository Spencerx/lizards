		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been trying Gnome-shell for a while on Fedora 15. Honestly, I like it, but I&#039;m not totally convinced. First of all, when you boot your desktop you find yourself with an useless background, and you must go to &quot;Activities&quot; before you can do anything. I would love to see a &quot;Desktop&quot; tab near &quot;Activities&quot;, in order to place all my shortcuts there (and a few files I want to access quickly).

Without something like that, I feel like I am loosing functionality here. In my case, I&#039;ve been using KDE 4 since 4.4 ;)

Regards!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[By the way, I&#039;ve seen the video you flagged on Facebook, installing openSUSE in less than 10 mins... I did it on my normal hardware with a USB2/3 stick (GNOME Live CD 11.4).

Awesome stuff, it&#039;s really fast... I&#039;ve made a small post about it on my forgotten blog (http://nmarques.digitalwhores.net).

This should be advertised by openSUSE Marketing, as it&#039;s a simple procedure with very cool results...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know, I&#039;ve loaded fcrozat&#039;s spin first, and I have to say that aside from a small glitch on the ATI driver, fcrozat&#039;s spin offers a bit more ;) People who might try both will know what I mean... though there&#039;s a heads up, Fedora ALPHA is very fast loading and shutting down, damn impressive.

For those who remember David Lynch&#039;s Dune, there&#039;s a small quote I would love to use as a metaphor: &quot;I start to like this Duke&quot; &#062; &quot;I start to like this gnome-shell&quot; ;)

I think GNOME3 is gonna be a killer, but nevertheless, I was expecting better artwork... I hope the final release improves it...

I&#039;m tempted to buy a couple whips and check if our GNOME monkeys work faster with some whip engineering/motivation ;)]]></description>
