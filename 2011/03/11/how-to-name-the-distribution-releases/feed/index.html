		<description><![CDATA[The current numbering is confusing as many people think that*.0 is beta where it is just linked around a new version of SUSE.

So what will be the impact on the SLE numbering? I would suggest that there still would be some linking between the two. Otherwise you will get something like &quot;openSUSE 2018.04 is a bit the same as SLE 14&quot;

So if SLE won&#039;t follow, stay with old school, where I think *.0 used to be the version before SLE * and then the once after it where called *.1, *.2, *.3 and even *.4 with some versions.

My preference would be YYYY.MM so 2011.11

Or go geeky all the way and use ddate.

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s an interesting change. I&#039;m the editor of MuyLinux, a Linux blog in spanish, and I&#039;ve made a little poll there (one of the most important blogs about Linux in Spanish globally) and maybe this data could be useful for you. The post URL is:

Good luck with the decision!]]></description>
