		<description><![CDATA[I prefer Guake to Tilda, seems to need less tuning and is a little less &#039;glitchy&#039; for me

and with GNOME 3 I find myself, reluctantly, using Empathy because of its superior G3 integration, I am missing some of those nice Pidgin features tho..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Parcellite looks like a good idea â€” especially as it is in the distro itself, while Glipper lives in Contrib.

		<description><![CDATA[I agree.
It does not take a lot of time to get your &quot;workflow&quot; back because everything just works... very productive and efficient.
What I also like are the fonts, they are very polished OOTB and it gives an additional pro-look.
Trying gnome shell but sticking with defaults for now ;-)
Also, the Windows integration (AD account, evolution-exchange, nautilus connections) on openSuSE is the best of all linux distro&#039;s]]></description>
