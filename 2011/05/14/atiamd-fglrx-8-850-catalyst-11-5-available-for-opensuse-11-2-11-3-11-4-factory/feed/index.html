		<description><![CDATA[This is not working at all :o(
I am able to use my 3D ATI card when on Kubuntu but on openSUSE and Fedora Gnome 3. It is a no-go. I&#039;m starting to suspect it is related to the RPM as opposed to DEB?

I am on a 64-bit ATI HD4650 system. Out of the box when I install openSUSE the RADEON driver for 3D and seems to work fine and I get a nice 3D effect when activating the desktop cube. However I need to be able to run Phoenix Viewer from Secons Life (www.phoenixviewer.com). 

I have no problems installing the actual ATI Catalyst and after that to enter the administrative control panel of it. The System Information screen show that I am using ATI and that the 2D is atken care of by &quot;fglrx&quot;. However the line &quot;3D&quot; is gone and the desktop cube effect is also gone. 

Also I am getting odd diagonal lines on my panels at the top and at the bottom of the screen (where I have panels). Looks kinda cool - but obviously an error..

It must - mustn&#039;t it? - be possible to do this in a proper user friendly manner? If Kubuntu can why on earth can&#039;t openSUSE? 

Hope someone can help - before I bite the apple and return to Kubuntu...]]></description>
