		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

We&#039;re pushing 2.1.0 to Factory (in fact 11.4 was released with 1.9.5 if I&#039;m not mistaken). So we&#039;re not breaking anything. On Banshee repositories it&#039;s flagged with &#039;Available for build&#039;, so it should really have any issues.

The renaming of the package is being taken care and it should be peaceful. OBS is a bit slow now (I assume it&#039;s because of Factory rebuild).

NP, I think that by the end of the week we&#039;ll have all repositories working ok and properly synched.

		<description><![CDATA[Banshee dev here.

Please notice:
- ipod-sharp dependency was removed on version 2.1.0, not 2.0.1.
- rename of the launcher from &quot;banshee-1&quot; to &quot;banshee&quot; should actually have been included in stable (2.0.1) because the changes landed before the 2.0.0 tag.

Thanks for your work.]]></description>
