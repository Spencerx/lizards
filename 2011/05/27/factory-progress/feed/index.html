		<description><![CDATA[One thing I noticed is that the bug for those using pppoe still exist in this new version.  I know this bug will be fixed and should be fixed before 12.1 is released.  I hope that with this release they look at fixing bugs and not passing them along to the next release.  I guess some bugs were not in 11.3 but in 11.4.  I just hope that this release is the best yet and stays in beta long enough to test all the bugs and get rid of them before it is released.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@6205: hmmm. I haven&#039;t configured any mirror by hand as mirrorbrain should do that automatically - see http://omgsuse.com/content/sharing-opensuse-world-mirrorbrain ;-)

Maybe not picking a mirror by hand will be helpful? The many improvements in zypper to speed up download of repository updates and packages should really make it faster than anything out there, and be able to fill your network pipeline to the max... It does do that here for most packages...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Andreas,

thank you very much for this article. The point with the two different auto checks in factory was new for me. I thought that a human declines my sr with a legal issue ;-)
Thanks.
