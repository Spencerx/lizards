		<description><![CDATA[Is there any progress on implementing Qt Support? Are there any plans to integrate the appmenu-qt patches into openSUSE Qt packages to make plasma-widget-menubar work for Qt and KDE apps?

I have GTK apps and even Libreoffice working now with the Plasma applet, but no Qt (which feels a bit wrong ...). So the widget itself works well but it would still need a patch to Qt. And I don&#039;t want to rebuild the whole Qt myself, also because I don&#039;t really know how to integrate these patches into Qt.]]></description>
