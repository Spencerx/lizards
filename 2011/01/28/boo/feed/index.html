		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I&#039;m not writing a paper on computational linguistics, so I&#039;ll just blacklist a number of packages. It&#039;s not just English words, BTW, but the bot probably won&#039;t be able to recognize a bug in the &quot;rpm&quot; program itself and a couple of others. Too bad the hackweek is over now and I have nothing close to an alpha version :-(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LOL.

May be some kind of context awareness could help. But given that it is possible to fool even human-beings with clever statements that could be ambiguous, it can never be perfect.

I think you have to blacklist such packages and avoid detecting those packages. Let those bugs rot as a punishment. ;-)]]></description>
