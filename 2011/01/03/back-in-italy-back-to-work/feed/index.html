		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sagi,

i would love to.
I hope you stripped some stuff from the tarball, or you&#039;ll not be allowed to package xbmc in OBS because of patents. codecs, and other stuff is included into the source tarball.

xbmc is quite a tought package to build!

not a problem to cooperate :) but i think packman is a better place to do that!

Andrea
p.s. you can contact me at my @opensuse.org email
