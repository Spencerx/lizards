		<description><![CDATA[Hi Natanael,

hey, great to hear from you! You&#039;ve discovered my blog! :-D I wanted to bother you with a mail anyway but you was faster than me. :)

Natanael, it doesn&#039;t need great programming skills to help. Sometimes it is enough to file a bug report, point out problems, improve our Wiki, or -- as you did -- create wonderful fonts. IHMO this skill is underestimated and fills a gap in the open source community.

I&#039;m watching your page almost on a daily basis. With my tiny contribution, I hope your work will get more widespread and known to the public. Unfortunately, I was a bit slow as I was busy with other things so I didn&#039;t think of writing a blog entry about this. Well, that&#039;s fixed now. ;)

Keep up the great work and, with some luck, we will use it also in our Web pages or books as well.

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Thomas, thanks for sharing my work with this community!
Its interesting because a few years ago I was a opensuse user myself, and I wanted to help it go further but haven&#039;t that much to offer. But with this typeface I think I can offer something! : )]]></description>
