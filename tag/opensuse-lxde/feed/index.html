				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>openSUSE 12.1 is on its way, and recently LXDE got some major updates.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m personally always been really satisfied of how LXDE works and is integrated into the openSUSE user experience, one defect though , that I&#8217;m really sorry about, is that i was never able to provide a very nice look&amp;feel.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not a graphic, and i realized I&#8217;m failing, i decide to ask your help now.</p>
<p>Here is what we need:</p>
<p>1) A gtk2 + openbox theme (including lxpanel background and icon theme)</p>
<p>2) A theme for lxdm (you can use /usr/share/lxdm/themes/Industrial as template), and eventually a background too</p>
<p>Also, i would like to open a contest. Your goal is create a logo for openSUSE-LXDE project.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have more information as soon as possible about this contest on the opensuse-lxde@o.o mailing list and here on lizards, please keep in mind that we want to print the winning logo on t-shirts too.</p>
<p>Up to date info about the contest will be available in the wiki <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:LXDE_Logo_Contest" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>I hope lot&#8217;s of you will help.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GTK3 will slowly replace the &#8220;old&#8221; gtk2, and of course, if we don&#8217;t want to be left behind we have to move to gtk3 eventually.</p>
<p>Even if <em>slowly </em>(we need horse power! &#8211;&gt; yes we need you too!!) LXDE is being ported too. Nothing has been released yet, but a good deal of work is actually into git repositories.</p>
<h3>X11:lxde:gtk3 project</h3>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://build.opensuse.org" target="_blank">openSUSE Build Service</a> (public instance of the <a href="http://openbuildservice.org/" target="_blank">Open Build Service</a>) we are currently able to get git code and build it auto-magically (thanks god you created obs _services <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="&#x1f600;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</p>
<p>Right now, only five packages don&#8217;t want to build with gtk3 and they are: <strong>gpicview, libfm, lxmusic, lxpanel, pcmanfm</strong>. Everything else builds fine. As a side note, lxdm gtk greeter build but seems to crasch.</p>
<p>Please test those packages and report in our mailing list or even better upstream your issues.</p>
<p>To conclude, right now i don&#8217;t feel comfortable to push into factory gtk3 packages, so 12.1 most probably will stuck with the well know stable gtk2 packages.</p>
<p>Also, i&#8217;m actually working to use obs, to provide gtk3 enabled git nightly build not only to openSUSE (actually only &gt;= 11.4) but also to<strong> Fedora 15</strong> (already building with many successful packages) and <strong>Ubuntu/Debian</strong>. So if you are .deb packagers, please let me know, i need your help. Contact me and the lxde team using our mailing list <strong>opensue-lxde@opensuse.org</strong></p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Andrea</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After announcing <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/07/23/opensuse-lxde-11-3-live-cd/" target="_blank">few days ago</a> the first beta of the openSUSE-LXDE live CD based on openSUSE 11.3, the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:LXDE" target="_blank">openSUSE-LXDE</a> <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:LXDE_team" target="_blank">team</a> is proud to announce the <strong>openSUSE-LXDE 11.3 RC1 Live-CD</strong>.</p>
<p>The isos finally fit into a CD, the sizes are 666MB for the 32bit version and 680MB for the 64bit version.</p>
<p>While the betas versions was into the 0.0.x series (0.0.1, 0.0.2, ecc), this RC and the next ones (if needed) will be into the 0.x.y series (0.1.0, 0.1.1, 0.2.0, ecc)</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide as soon as possible a stable release that will be 1.0.0.</p>
<p>Please help us, test this iso, report any missing/un-needed package you find, any bug or issue.</p>
<p>If none will be reported, most probably this configuration will be rebuilt as 1.0.0 and released to the public as STABLE.</p>
<p>Rember users <strong>root </strong>and <strong>linux </strong>has NO password.</p>
<p>The iso, as usal is hybrid and persistent, so if copied into a USB pendrive, at the first boot it will expand and create a read-write folder were you can save your datas.</p>
<p>Download as usual, is available under X11:lxde project here:</p>
<p><a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/lxde/images/iso/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/lxde/images/iso/</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi people,</p>
<p>I know lots of you was waiting for that, and i am really sorry if it took some time, but i can finally announce the first beta release for our 11.3 live cd.</p>
<p>It is still a beta and such as it have some flaws, like for example it doesn&#8217;t fit into a CD yet. The good news is that this is an hybrid and permanent iso, so you can use dd to copy the iso into your usb pendrive.</p>
<p>Please help us testing and reporting bugs and issues you find.</p>
<p>To download the isos, as usual browse here!</p>
<p><a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/lxde/images/iso/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/lxde/images/iso/</a></p>
<p>i believe i should be able to release new isos soon, i need to at least provide you isos able to fit into a cd!</p>
<p>Andrea</p>
