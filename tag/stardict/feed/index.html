				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog does not add any information to the documentation you can find around. Anyway, it is not too long since someone was able to make Babylon dictionaries usable by software other than the proprietary Babylon application. And they have been trying for years&#8230; so it has not been a trivial step  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If you do not know Stardict, you can get it from Yast. This is <a href="http://stardict.sourceforge.net/index.php"> the official site.</a></p>
<p>A few dictionaries are also linked &#8211; ready and free to use &#8211; at Stardict website. However, I used Babylon when I was a Windows user and i have to admit that their dictionaries remain unbeaten. Matters not what language you want, mono-language or bi-language, technical, general purpose etc etc&#8230; they just rock!</p>
<p>You can get tons of dictionaries for free from <a href="http://www.babylon.com/gloss/">Babylon website</a>: </p>
<p>Now, go to Yast Software Manager and search for <strong>dictconv</strong>. Alternatively, you can install<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=146506&amp;package_id=221578"> from source </a>(which is what I personally did).</p>
<p>Installing is very easy:     <em>./configure </em> and then<em> make all install</em></p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re all set. To <strong>use</strong> it to convert:</p>
<p>cd to the directory where you have the .BGL dictionaries and type:    <strong><em>dictconv INPUT_FILENAME.BGL -o OUTPUT_FILENAME.ifo</em></strong></p>
<p>Pay attention to the extension: must be .ifo. This will generate 3 files for each BGL dictionary: .ifo, .idx, .dict</p>
<p>Place all these 3 files in /usr/share/stardict/dic/  creating a separate folder for each dictionary. Then rebook Stardict and go to Manage Dictionary (bottom right): there you can select what comes first, activate or deactivate etc etc</p>
<p>Nothing difficult but def worth, and not only for non native speakers.. there are lots of technical terminology Babylon dictionaries that may well come handy.</p>
<p>Notice that with Stardict you can also implement Pronunciations of the typed words: see <a href="http://stardict.sourceforge.net/download.php">Stardict site</a>: &#8220;WyabdcRealPeopleTTS package make StarDict pronounce English words. It is just many .wav files. Extract(tar -xjvf) the tarball at /usr/share/&#8221;.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Sooo well&#8230; Have fun ~ Buon divertimento ~ Viel Spa√ü ~ I que te diviertas ~ Maak plezier ~ ha s√• roligt [hmm i&#8217;m just hoping the dictionaries mentioned just above are not making me do some poor figure for these few transations of &#8220;Have Fun&#8221;.. cuz i have no idea for any language except Italian :D]</p>
