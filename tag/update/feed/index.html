				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear fellows, in our moving free world, it&#8217;s not always bienvenue to talk about one of the *kit* software around.<br />
Most of them have bad reputation, (with good or bad reasons) this is the debate of this post.</p>
<p>But in the uni-kit-verse there&#8217;s one you must known, especially if you are the proud owner of a laptop or one of this computer the manufacter deliver its firmware only in DOS exe format.<br />
FirmwareUpdateKit (was introduced in 2008 in openSUSE by <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2008/06/16/firmwareupdatekit/">Steffen Winterfeldt</a></p>
<h1>How that works?</h1>
<p>As the title of the post give you the right command, open a console, then use the cnf (command-not-found) tool to learn what to do</p>
<h2>Install the package</h2>
<pre>
cnf fuk

The program 'fuk' can be found in the following package:
  * FirmwareUpdateKit [ path: /usr/bin/fuk, repository: zypp (repo-oss) ]

Try installing with:
    zypper install FirmwareUpdateKit
</pre>
<p>Pretty clear and cool, let&#8217;s install that stuff!</p>
<pre>sudo zypper install FirmwareUpdateKit
root's password:

The following NEW packages are going to be installed:
  FirmwareUpdateKit syslinux 

2 new packages to install.
Overall download size: 758.0 KiB. After the operation, additional 2.1 MiB will be used.
Continue? [y/n/?] (y): y
Retrieving package syslinux-4.04-12.1.3.x86_64 (1/2), 642.0 KiB (1.9 MiB unpacked)
Retrieving: syslinux-4.04-12.1.3.x86_64.rpm [done]
Retrieving package FirmwareUpdateKit-1.1-14.1.1.x86_64 (2/2), 116.0 KiB (178.0 KiB unpacked)
Retrieving: FirmwareUpdateKit-1.1-14.1.1.x86_64.rpm [done]
Installing: syslinux-4.04-12.1.3 [done]
Installing: FirmwareUpdateKit-1.1-14.1.1 [done]

<h2>Get your bios</h2>
<p>Nothing easy for that, you will have to surf on boring mfg website, and find an appropriate bios for your computer.</p>
<p>Be serious during that selection, you can screw up totally your computer</p>
<h2>Time to fuk</h2>
<p>As always before running a program, it&#8217;s always good to check if there&#8217;s the fine manual (not the case here) or try a -h &#8211;help</p>
<pre>
fuk --help
Usage: fuk [OPTIONS] FILES
FirmwareUpdateKit version 1.1.

Create bootable DOS system and add FILES to it.
The main purpose is to assist with DOS-based firmware updates.

Options:
  --grub                        Add boot entry to /boot/grub/menu.lst.
  --lilo                        Add boot entry to /etc/lilo.conf.
  --title TITLE                 Use TITLE as label for boot menu entry.
  --iso FILE                    Create bootable CD.
  --floppy FILE                 Create bootable (1440 kB) floppy disk.
  --image FILE                  Create bootable harddisk.
  --run COMMAND                 Run COMMAND after booting DOS.
  --verbose                     Be more verbose.
</pre>
<p>Nothing complicated as a nuclear plan here, everything seems to be self explicit.<br />
Let try it, and install a new grub entry for the new A8 version for my lappy.
</p>
<pre>
fuk --verbose --grub --run M4600A08.exe /home/bruno/src_tmp/HARDWARE/DELL_M4600/M4600A08.exe 
/tmp/fuk.lSVIgS0cMt/fwupdate.img: chs = 186/4/16, size = 11904 blocks
- writing mbr
- writing fat12 boot block
- copying:
    /usr/share/FirmwareUpdateKit/kernel.sys
    /usr/share/FirmwareUpdateKit/command.com
    /tmp/fuk.lSVIgS0cMt/config.sys
    /tmp/fuk.lSVIgS0cMt/autoexec.bat
    /home/bruno/src_tmp/HARDWARE/DELL_M4600/M4600_A08.exe
c-3po:~ # 
</pre>
<p>That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve now a new entry in my grub list</p>
<pre>
title Firmware Update
    kernel /boot/memdisk
    initrd /boot/fwupdate.img
</pre>
<h2>Apply</h2>
<p>Now just reboot and use the grub entry, then upgrade your bios, like you will normally have done with you old complicated build iso, or diskette (I&#8217;m joking)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting with 11.0, the <a title="The openSUSE-Education project" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Education" target="_self">openSUSE-Education</a> project hosts it&#8217;s own, separate <a title="The openSUSE-Education update repository" href="http://www.opensuse-education.org/download/updates/1.0/" target="_blank">update repository</a>. This is our solution for the <a title="Why the buildservice is currently not for endusers" href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2009/02/19/why-the-buildservice-is-currently-not-for-endusers/" target="_blank">strategic decision</a> not to use the openSUSE Build Service as repository for endusers but for development only.</p>
<p>So for production purposes, we always recommend to use our frozen repositories on<a title="Installation repositories on openSUSE-Education.org" href="http://www.opensuse-education.org/download/repos/1.0/" target="_blank"> http://download.opensuse-education.org/</a>. But as &#8220;frozen&#8221; implies, the repositories there are frozen at the time, the openSUSE-Education team declares them as &#8220;Goldmaster&#8221; (which is the case for all except the 11.1 repo at the moment) &#8211; and no package update or changes happens for this repositories.</p>
<p>The openSUSE-Education team has relatively long development and testing cycles &#8211; but as everywhere, shi* happens, and so it might be that some of the packages in the frozen repository are broken or need a security fix. For this, we have created <a title="openSUSE-Education update repos" href="http://www.opensuse-education.org/download/updates/1.0/" target="_blank">update repositories</a> (for at least 11.0 and the upcomming 11.1 Edu-Release) which are disabled per default, but added to the system during installation of the openSUSE-Education-releaseÂ  package. (Reason behind this decision: if an administrator installs openSUSE-Education in a school, he wants to &#8220;mirror&#8221; the update repositories and not point every client to the official ones. All a user has to do is to enable this update repository via YaST or via &#8220;zypper mr -e &#8216;openSUSE-Education Updates'&#8221;.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re using the &#8220;updateinfo.xml&#8221; file formal <a title="Updateinfo description" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Patch_Management/Code11/Updateinfo" target="_blank">described in the openSUSE-Wiki</a>. Currently, we&#8217;ve 5 package updates/fixes for 11.0 in the update repository &#8211; and this might grow over the time. The updates are shown in the current online-update-applets as &#8220;normal&#8221; updates like the openSUSE ones. Interestingly, the user can&#8217;t see if an update is from the official openSUSE or the openSUSE-Education update repository &#8211; even if we use a different &#8220;from&#8221; tag. Perhaps we have to &#8220;play&#8221; with the &#8220;release&#8221; or other tags: testing is needed as it looks like nobody tries this before&#8230;</p>
