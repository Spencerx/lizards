				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really hope you readied last article &#8216;<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/10/07/opensuse-and-gcc-part1/" title="OpenSUSE and GCC part 1: getting started">OpenSUSE and GCC part 1: getting started</a>&#8216; or you understand basics and you have GCC (Only GNU C Compiler as GCC stands Gnu Compiler Collection) installed. This time we learn how to compile application called &#8216;Hello World&#8217;. It&#8217;s so popular application even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_World" title="Hello world program">wikipedia have article about it</a>. <span id="more-10010"></span>If you are not in reading mood I&#8217;ll explain it in short.</p>
<h2>Hello world</h2>
<p>Hello world is small application that programmer tends to start with when learning new programming language. It&#8217;s just something that prints &#8216;Hello World&#8217;-string in console. It&#8217;s good starting point to learn new programming language as in compiling languages you get the idea how to make application run.<br />
Github is the programming project hosting place that uses <a href="http://git-scm.com/" title="Git SCM">git</a>. If you adventurous you can see all the language &#8216;Hello World&#8217; programs from this <a href="https://github.com/git/hello-world" title="Hello World Github">Github page</a>. Just click them around and see that every program has the same idea. If you have no clue what all this means don&#8217;t feel bad! I hope in some point of you openSUSE hacking time you probably get back there and understand value of that small application.<br />
In C-Language &#8216;Hello World&#8217; looks like this:</p>
<pre>
#include &#060;stdio.h&#062;

int main(void) {
printf("Hello World\n");
return 0;
}</pre>
<p>Copy these sentences as they are to &#8216;<em>helloworld.c</em>&#8216; file with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_%28text_editor%29" title="Pico editor">pico</a>, <a href="http://nano-editor.org/" title="Nano editor">nano</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="Vi improved">vim</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" title="GNU Emacs">emacs</a>, <a href="https://projects.gnome.org/gedit/" title="Gnome Gedit">gedit</a>, <a href="http://kate-editor.org/" title="Kate editor">kate</a> or some other text editor. Pay some attention where you save that &#8216;helloworld.c&#8217;. Easiest place would be you home dirs root /home/&#8217;yourusername&#8217;/. I won&#8217;t tell you want all this C-language means if you are <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c/lesson1.html" title="Introduction to C">interested please read how to get along with C</a> and you see how easy language C really is.</p>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you have used PHP, Python, Bash or Perl (maybe Ruby) in other words some programming language that doesn&#8217;t need compiling you are point of life to take a deep breath. If you have ever touched any programming language you in my position when I was 16 and started typing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Turbo_C%2B%2B" title="Borland Turbo C++">Borland Turbo C++</a> and take event deeper breath. If you have used Microsoft Visual Studio and which is incredible piece of IDE and you tell yourself you know something about programming you take mild breathe and zip of water. Only problem with IDEs is you never know how the magic happens behind the scenes. Specially Visual Studio is very very good make you application just compile and in most of the cases that is what you want right?<br />
There is some cases you need to get in the bottom and understand basic of compiling process. I tell one example from my life. In some point of my life I was ext in Nokia (Way before it was Microsoft owned phone company) and their phone build scripts were in HP-UX or AIX (can&#8217;t remember anymore sorry). There were nearly &#8216;NaN&#8217; of people who understand how these Makefile scripts worked (they were mostly very cryptic cross compile Makefile stuff) and they just saw my fellow ext-buddy sitting there behind his desk. They gave these scripts to this poor fellow and weeks he cried, moaned and felt pain in his brains from compiling extremely complicated application. In the end he did it. He made those build scripts to work because he understand how compiling and linking was actually made and if I’m not wrong he got work place from Nokia for years to come.<br />
Now I Cut the sentimental crap and tell how to compile program. It&#8217;s easy go to directory you have created &#8216;<em>helloworld.c</em>&#8216; and write this in console</p>
<pre>
gcc -o helloworld helloworld.c</pre>
<p>was it so hard? In setence &#8216;<em>gcc</em>&#8216; is GNU C Compiler and paramter &#8216;<strong>-o</strong>&#8216; is application binary name (choose wisely young badawan it will write over your files if have same file name).</p>
<h2>Run program</h2>
<p>Running the program isn&#8217;t hard at all. Stay in directory that program is and write to console</p>
<pre>
./helloworld
Hello World</pre>
<p>Now you have compiled you first program. Next we look at RPM devel packages and using libraries and headers. <strong>Remember &#8216;./&#8217; is very needed in front this example because you want to run application from your current location.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you feel as an open source developer, user, or enthusiast if you see this beautiful piece of software is used by hundred of schools and thousand of students? Great isn&#8217;t it? And that&#8217;s what happened here in a small dot on this earth in <a title="Yogyakarta Special Region" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta_%28special_region%29" target="_blank">Yogyakarta Indonesia</a>.</p>
<p>This program was initiated by the Government of Indonesia with the objective to introduce the open source and e-learning method to student and teacher. So three years ago I was contacted to help them to realize their dream, and here I&#8217;m now reporting that there are around 7300 openSUSE installation in <a title="openSUSE in schools" href="http://ict-eqep.com/locations/map_350.html" target="_blank">350 elementary and junior-high schools</a>. We also use SLES in servers to provide repositories and e-learning materials in SCORM using Moodle.  This is work in progress. We educate teachers to use openSUSE and also creating learning material so it is always in beta stage I think <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I want to say thank you to all the good people, my friends and co-workers, they are unknown in openSUSE community, even many of them are not subscribing the mailing list, but they are the true openSUSE ambassadors in Indonesia. They come to schools and persuade the teachers to use openSUSE. Without them this dream will never come true. Picture below show some of them smiling holding the openSUSE 12.1 promo DVD that AJ sent to me. You all great! Also picture of teachers while following our session about openSUSE.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Education project - even if currently not very present on the <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-edu/">mailinglist</a> or IRC - is very alive and actively working on many internal and external areas. The openSUSE Conference was a good place to meet some of the members and discuss many possible new topics or improvements.

I like to give a very subjective overview about the current state, so the rumors have something to eat ;-)]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even if the <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/08/15/opensuse-edu-li-f-e-11-4-update-release-announcement/">last news</a> from the Education project is just one month old, many people asked me during the openSUSE Conference why the Education project itself is currently so quiet.</p>
<p>Well, the &#8220;problem&#8221; is, that our Education team is currently more a team of technical specialists and many work is done behind the scenes without communication to &#8220;the outside&#8221;. So even if you did not hear from us for some weeks, we are still alive and coding! </p>
<p>Here are just a few examples, that are going on behind the scenes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translation of the new <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Education">openSUSE Education Portal</a> is work in progress. Many thanks to our contributors <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Guillaume_G">Guillaume</a> for the Français, <a href="http://nl.opensuse.org/Gebruiker:Fdekruijf">Freek de Kruijf</a> for the Nederlands, <a href="http://pt.opensuse.org/Utilizador:Sabarth">Sabarth</a> for the Português, <a href="http://ru.opensuse.org/Участник:Gankov">Gankov</a> for the Русский (Russian) Portal translation!</li>
<li>Kirill is currently reviewing all 425(!) packages in the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=Education">Build Service Education project</a> and submitting them to <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory">openSUSE Factory</a> afterwards &#8211; so openSUSE 12.1 will come with a huge set of packages directly inside the official repository.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Cyberorg">Cyberorg</a> is working on the next release of the openSUSE Edu Li-f-e DVD with the LTSP integration.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Anubisg1">Anubusg1</a> and many others (the project currently lists 44 maintainers) are doing the &#8220;normal&#8221; packaging stuff like upgrading and fixing packages for 12.1 (aka Factory)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Desktop4Education project from Austria was again present at the Conference and gave a great overview of the current status of the project during <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//contributionDisplay.py?contribId=41&amp;confId=2">their talk</a>. Good to hear that the project is being frequently used as a reference case by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Education, Arts and Culture and as such promoted by them throughout Austria.</p>
<p>Talking with Andre Massing from the <a href="http://www.simula.no/">Simula Research Laboratory</a> during <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//contributionDisplay.py?contribId=108&amp;confId=2">his talk</a> at the conference was quite interesting. Looks like the Science project might see some very interesting new packages in the next months. During the discussion, we agree that the Education and the Science project can share a lot of efforts in their project setups and organization. But they will stay separated (at least in the Build Service) as their audience is very different, even if they share some packages (which is currently done via links inside the Build Service).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yogyakarta is one of the tourism destination in Indonesia. The unique Javanise tradition blend with some acculturation from outside culture. Recently I was asked by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology and Office of Education, Youth and Sport of Yogyakarta to help them to prepare the computer lab for elementary and junior high school in Yogyakarta Province &#8211; Indonesia.</p>
<p>Well, this is the tough job. I work with some expert, teacher and education strategist to prepare the e-learning system. We should prepare learning/teaching material in digital format, train the teacher to use authoring tools and operating system, and prepare the schools to be ready to receive the PC&#8217;s. This government initiative will involve 500 schools in 3 years. Every school that involve in this program will receive 21 PCs.</p>
<p>We select openSUSE Li-f-e as the operating system in every pc. The selection is not because I&#8217;m an openSUSE member but we come to the conclusion that openSUSE Li-f-e is the most complete and well prepare distribution for education  (well, I convince other expert, some of them are Ph.D, he..he&#8230;). This year there are 110 schools involve in this program, this means another new 2310 openSUSE installation and more than 4000 new users if we assume that every PC will be used by 2 students.</p>
<p>Not only give PC to schools we also should connect the schools to the provincial data center. This is really challenging task, some areas of this province is covered by hundred of hills with karst topography and with no terestrial internet connection. Many of the schools is in that area. The road ahead still far away and difficult, but see the face of the children who really enthusiast with the openSUSE make me really happy.</p>

On May 3, 2010 the openSUSE Ambassador was invited to talk about &#8220;Introducción a las características y ventajas de openSUSE, su relación con NOVELL y la comunidad de usuarios&#8221; (“An Introduction to New Features and Advantages on openSUSE 11.2, the openSUSE Project Community and the relationship with NOVELL”). When I did talk about openSUSE. People came from a few persons in the room to suddenly filling the whole space available for that room. Surprisingly, I had the opportunity to watch several girls between the audience so I thought there is a chance to organize a chix open source community or users group.
