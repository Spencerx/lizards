				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the launch of 11.0 there were several little projects started by the community these projects were actually really helpful and we would like to think contributed to the uptake and success of the 11.0 release.  Now I will admit that I can&#8217;t substantiate this with any hard (or soft) facts, but none the less that&#8217;s our gut feeling <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So what are the projects in question?  Well they are: <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME/HowTos/Helping_Hands_Topics" title="HH">Helping Hands</a>, <a href="http://opensuse-tutorials.com/" title="oS-T">openSUSE-Tutiorials</a> and <a href="http://opensuse.blip.tv/" title="oS TV">openSUSE TV</a>.  Funny I can hear some people moaning and groaning that these are GNOME Team projects, WRONG!!  These projects have indeed been started by members of the GNOME Team, but they are for the whole distribution and project.  I know <a href="http://www.bryen.com/" title="suseROCKs blog and beyond">suseROCKs</a> has tried in the past to try and get some contributions from other teams, so don&#8217;t blame the GNOME Team for the content blame yourselves.</p>
<p>Actually on second thought, drop the whole blame game thing.  A better solution is to start a fresh and keep up the momentum.  I am basically asking members of the openSUSE Community (that means ALL of you!) to step up and take the wild Geeko by the reigns and help teach all those non-believers that it really is easy to use, has some brilliant features (easily found and hidden), and generally a great distro and project to use and be involved in.</p>
<p>So if we take each item in turn:</p>
<p>1) <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME/HowTos/Helping_Hands_Topics" title="HH">Helping Hands</a>:   HH (as we affectionately call it) is aimed at giving an insight into certain aspects of the distro that a user may come across or wish to use.  In the past we have had sessions on Inkscape, Evolution, Banshee, general GNOME usage and other applications.  We are hoping to have one on packaging RPMs and using the Build Service in the not so distant future.  We would love to see members of the KDE community enlighten us (yes some of the GNOME users are scared of things that begin with K) about things that are going on in there, I know there are loads of great things I&#8217;m just really knowledgeable in them or even know 25% of them.  We would also like members of XFCE and any other desktop environment that&#8217;s out there to do the same.  You can focus on a specific application, a suite of applications or anything that will be helpful to users.  If possible get someone from upstream join in, it makes things much more interesting and actually opens eyes on both sides of the fence as to what is going on.  If you are interested (why wouldn&#8217;t you be?) and are willing to help out (you know you want to) then please let wither myself (FunkyPenguin) or suseROCKs know on IRC, we hang out in most of the openSUSE channels.</p>
<p>2) <a href="http://opensuse-tutorials.com/" title="oS-T">openSUSE-Tutiorials</a>: oS-T is aimed at being a repository of insights, tips &amp; tricks etc on applications and other things with the distro.  Why not just use the Wiki?  Well in a nutshell there are times when the Wiki just isn&#8217;t suited, and this way topics can be easily grouped so are ultimately easily searchable.  Not only by the big search engines, but also by any user who visits the site.  Content is moderated prior to being published, and before you start screaming of a conspiracy to silence the truth it is actually to try and ensure that those items published are actually of good quality and will genuinely be of use.  For more info on publishing something for oS-T then please ask either decriptor or suseROCKs on IRC (again they loiter in most channels).</p>
<p>3) <a href="http://opensuse.blip.tv/" title="oS TV">openSUSE TV</a>: oS TV is aimed at providing a medium to show all the wonderous videos that we have on and about openSUSE.  These don&#8217;t have to be any of the official videos that are done at conferences but can also include screencasts, interviews and almost any other form of video that we have about openSUSE (both distro and project).  The channel is part of the blip.tv service and as such is aimed at all platforms, not just Linux.  We want to try and grow our user base and community which means looking at the competing Operating Systems.  I am hoping to do a series of interviews at the upcoming FOSDEM show similar to those that I did in Nurenberg for Hack Week III; I have pencilled in the title of &#8220;Face to Face @ FOSDEM&#8217;09&#8221;.  So if you&#8217;re going to be at the event (try and make it if you can because it is really a great event), and you have a specific topic you&#8217;d like to speak about then let me know.  I would love to get more content on there, screencast would be great as would videos from LUG meetings where openSUSE is used/showcased etc.  Remember oS TV is about the community, for the community, by the community.  So your input is needed!</p>
<p>There is no reason why you can&#8217;t do an item on all three of the above and have them linked.  For an example you could do a HH item on the KDE desktop (general first look etc), you could also do a screencast of that item and have the screencast posted to oS TV and to finish it up you could have an oS-T article on tuning your desktop to get the best out of it.  If you feel that any of these are wrong/bad/need improving/$COMMENT then please keep those comments to yourself!!  In all seriousness, they can only improve with your help so please let us know all and any feedback that you may have.  Most importantly, please join in <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok now that my tubes to the net are back with gusto, I have been able to get all of <a title="openSUSE's Official video repository" href="http://tube.opensuse.org">tube.o.o</a> onto <a title="openSUSE's Online TV channel" href="http://opensuse.blip.tv">openSUSE TV</a>.Â  Actually oTV has some videos that aren&#8217;t on tube.o.o <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>With HackWeek 3 coming up this week, I&#8217;m hoping to get more videos up there.Â  So calling all Geecko Stations, if your make some videos of you escapades, please let me know and we&#8217;ll get them uploaded.Â  As it isn&#8217;t an official corporate sponsored site rules are a touch looser, e.g: video format doesn&#8217;t have to be in OGG, yes it would be preferable but not final.Â  I have a HackWeek project relating to the openSUSE Broadcasting Corporation, so the weeks after HackWeek should hopefully be good.Â  I&#8217;m hoping to be able to do some updates during the week too, but they may have to wait.</p>
<p>Remember if you have any suggestions or (preferably) any content to share with folk about openSUSE and it&#8217;s ecosystem please let me know.Â  You can get hold of me by leaving a comment here or <a title="e-mail the author" href="mailto:awafaa_{@}_opensuse_{.}_org">mail me</a> (you may need to edit the address <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).</p>
