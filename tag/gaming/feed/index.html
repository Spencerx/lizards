				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know, I know&#8230; it is a bit late ( more than a month ) since FLISOL took place in Guayaquil-Ecuador this year&#8230; but a lot a time consuming activities have stopped me from reporting some results. Even though more than a month have passed,  I think I should let you know what happened.</p>
<p>Compared to previous years, the event of this year was relatively smaller. An approximate of 200 people assisted, from which for the ~80% it was their first time that assisted to FLISOL, 50% of visitors had not used or heard about  FLOSS before, ~13% were below 18 years old and ~75% were between 18-35 years old.</p>

<p>There are 3 things that I would like to point from this year&#8217;s event:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most of the event was organized by the new members from <a title="KOKOA ESPOL" href="http://kokoa.espol.edu.ec/">Kokoa</a> ( ESPOL&#8217;s Free Software Community ), who I send my congratulations since it was a very good start. They were just newbies and took the challenge of  organizing the biggest FLOSS event in town. As an old Kokoa kore member I know how difficult can be to organize FLISOL, and I can say those guys did a good job.</li>
<li>One of the rooms that caught most of the attention of the visitors was the gaming room. It mostly attracted the young visitors from different genres.  I think that gnu/linux is a niche that has started to be exploited in the gaming area. Personally I have tried some games since the very first time I had openSUSE (SuSE Linux back then) installed and I have seen how good known titles and good quality indie games are coming to gnu/linux. I think that with <a title="openSUSE GameStore" href="http://gamestore.gk2.sk/" target="_blank">openSUSE GameStore</a> , some gamers and developers from the openSUSE community we can try to promote our lovely green as a good platform for gaming.</li>
<li>Last but not least, I would like to say thanks to <a title="jarflex.ec" href="http://jarflex.ec/">Jarflex, </a><a href="http://blog.espol.edu.ec/culturadigital/">ESPOL&#8217;s Digital Culture Club</a>, <a href="http://www.ecuagamers.com/">Ecuagamers</a> and all the people who contributed to  make this event possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>Summarizing, this year it was seen a collaboration between different groups and enterprises somehow related to FLOSS that , locally, was not seen before. This might be a further step of what was started in 2007 when we tried to take FLISOL from a FLOSS installation festival for FLOSS enthusiast to a FLOSS event that will catch the attention of people of different ages with different interests.</p>
<p>Until the next post people of the openSUSEsphere&#8230;</p>
