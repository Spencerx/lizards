				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No.. I haven&#8217;t forget you! I think of you every day, night and if I&#8217;m honest all the time. You and you and you and especially you who are reading these lines. This is going to be sort blog entry. I want you to know what you should start doing! Yes just stop being social in internet. Get out of your comfort zone and start <del>spank the monkey</del> (oh.. sorry not spank the monkey this is children approved blog..) er.. learning new stuff.<span id="more-11569"></span></p>
<p>Start you maker project and learn how to 3D with <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> (it&#8217;s marvelous 3D application). After Blender there is no excuse and it&#8217;s free (but remember if you really like it give something back). Are you on more on CAD? Learn 3D CAD with <a href="http://freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a> (Again amazing tool). Want to ride IoT wave but you don&#8217;t have too much money then get new shiny <a href="http://linuxgizmos.com/tiny-5-dollar-raspberry-pi-zero-keeps-it-simple/">Tiny $5 Raspberry Pi Zero</a> or <a href="http://nextthing.co/">9$ C.H.I.P</a> and make your <a href="http://fritzing.org">Fritzing</a> electric boogie with ease (and by the way you can commit those boards to library. It&#8217;s open source!). You are in music how about doing some DJ:n with linux? <a href="http://mixxx.org/">Mixxx</a> just got shiny 2.0 RC1 out. Are you more reading type and need something to manage you e-books: <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> is here to help. Huh so much to do so less time!</p>
<p>Where to get them? openSUSE have RPM for all of them just learn to search them from Packman or from <a href="https://build.opensuse.org">OBS</a>. Sorry to say Raspberry Pi <em>Zero is currently not supported but you can help to add it</em> to ARM boards working with openSUSE same problems with C.H.I.P (If you have Raspberry Pi 1/2 just get image for them from openSUSE ARM image and start hacking). You should learn how to add new repos to YaST2 and add <a href="http://packman.links2linux.de/">Packman</a> repo for new FreeCAD, Fritzing and Mixxx. Yes! most of them run also on Windows and Mac OS X. Now smile on, thumbs up and <strong>get your groove on</strong> with title song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxEu4uf0-b8">De La Soul &#8211; Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)</a></p>
