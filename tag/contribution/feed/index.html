				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a lot of dicussion in the openSUSE project about the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org">project wiki</a> which was suffering from something all successful projects in some point of time experience: There is a huge amount of documentation in the Wiki, however it seems a bit unstructured, sometimes outdated or not really maintained.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Wiki_team">brave openSUSE wiki team</a> stepped up to change that. The decision is to set up a new wiki with a well selected set of extensions and now the content of the old wiki is going to be transfered to the new wiki. Of course there will be a rigorous quality check of the articles, as well as a new thought through structure. The goal of this huge amount of work is to provide a outstanding good and well consumable source of information for all people in and interested in the openSUSE project. That is a high goal and I admire the energy and dedication of the wiki team.</p>
<p>The new wiki is now in place. So if you also want to help, either with the motivation of a developer telling how things work, or from the upstream perspective using the openSUSE vehicle to push the project or simply because you want to help openSUSE to become even better, first read the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Transition_Guidelines">Transition Guidelines</a> and subscribe on the wiki mailinglist, since most of the coordination happens there.<br />
There is also a <a href="http://forums.opensuse.org/tech-news/428612-wiki-transition-call-contributors.html">Forum Thread</a> going on around that.</p>
<p>Please <b>help</b> to make this a success &#8211; thanks <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m an new Packager in OpenSUSE BuildService, and i like this work. But if i would like to package for Factory, RPMLINT gives me any Errors or warnings. But these things to fix, are very difficult. Our Wiki Side for RPMLINT doesn&#8217;t contain many Error or Warningcodes.</p>
<p>But yesterday i&#8217;ve found an Side, with other Errorcodes from RPMLINT. Today i imported these Codes to our Wikiside <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Packaging/RpmLint">http://en.opensuse.org/Packaging/RpmLint</a>. I think it is not possible to list all codes on the Side. But i wish, that the side includes more Codes in the future.</p>
<p>No i would like to make an Call for contribution. If every Packager insert the codes, that he knows, we have an good library soon.</p>
<p>And on this Moment i would like to make an request about helping- Thank you all for the hard Work.</p>
