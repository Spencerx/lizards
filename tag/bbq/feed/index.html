				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the fun and sun in Nurenberg continues <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="&#x1f600;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Again day 2 started off very much as day 1 &#8211; lots of discussions.Â  This is not a bad thing, and maybe Novell would consider sponsoring a ChatWeek (it could be condensed into 2 or 3 days), it is a fact that communication is the one major stumbling block that any company/community suffers from and Novell and openSUSE are no exception to this.</p>
<p>We started with general discussions and continuing some of the discussions we had over dinner last night.Â  After lunch we then continued our discussions on openSUSE and what/how things could be improved &#8211; highly productive and very inspiring to get internal and external community members to speak honestly and bluntly about their thoughts and ideas.Â  <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Note to the community (yes, all of you!):</strong> If you have thoughts on what or how to help imporve anything within the openSUSE universe speak up!!Â  If you&#8217;re not sure who or how to do so, the key contact details (in no particular order) are <a title="openSUSE Community Manager" href="http://zonker.opensuse.org">Zonker</a>, <a title="Communicating within openSUSE" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Communicate">opensuse-project mailing list</a>, <a title="openSUSE Project irc channel on freenode.net" href="irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-project">#opensuse-project</a> irc channel and of course the <a title="The openSUSE Board" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Board">openSUSE Board</a>.Â  One of the advantages of openSUSE is that you can pick things up and run with them, if you need any help just ask and people will rally around (sometimes it takes a bit of time but it does happen, honest).</p>
<p>After all the discussions I had just enough time to grab a drink before the first <a title="openSUSE Marketing Team" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Marketing_Team">openSUSE Marketing Team</a> <a title="First openSUSE Marketing Team irc Meeting transcript" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Marketing_Team/Meetings/2008_08_26-transcript">irc meeting</a> took place.Â  This was shorter than I would personally have like, but that was down to one very important reason &#8211; the HackWeek BBQ!</p>
<p>The BBQ was and is a great opportunity for people just to chat on all levels, and general have fun with some fine food and some fine Bavarian Beer &#8211; <a title="yaloki - the openSUSE jack of all trades" href="http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/">Pascal</a> will certainly disagree with me on the last point, but then again he is kind of correct; being Belgian he is used to a much wider variety and quality of beers, just go to <a title="Europe's premier Open Source event" href="http://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> to find out <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Â  You can see a montage of the video that I took over <a title="OMGWTFBBQ Montage" href="http://blip.tv/file/1210485">here</a> &#8211; yes I know it&#8217;s evil flash!</p>
<p>The party atmosphere went on long into the night and everyone managed to enjoy themselves.  Thank you SUSE for the fine food and beer, and thank you Pascal for bringing some prized Belgian beers for comparison with the Bavarian ones.</p>
