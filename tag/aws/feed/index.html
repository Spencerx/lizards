				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For quite some time we had a package named ec2-api-tools in the Cloud:EC2 project and I suspect many that work with EC2 had found the package and were using the ec2-* commands to manage stuff in EC2. Along with the ec2-api-tools Amazon maintained a separate ec2-* tool set for various services. Keeping up with the armada of Amazon developers is not easy and thus the other ec2-* tool sets never got packaged.</p>
<p>Now a new integrated set of tools is available called with the &#8220;aws&#8221; command and provided by the aws-cli package. The package is available from the Cloud:Tools project and a submit request to Factory is pending. The new package does not obsolete the ec2-api-tools package as there is no issue with having both packages installed. However, I did take the liberty to remove the ec2-api-tool package from the Cloud:EC2 project as it would no longer receive updates considering that we have a nice new tool that unifies all Amazon services. The documentation for the new command can be found <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cli/" title="here"></a>.</p>
<p>The aws code is hosted on github and thus contribution of fixes is easy and that is another big plus over the ec2-* tool sets.</p>
<p>Yes, and of course we need to get openSUSE 13.1 into EC2, and I am working on that, stay tuned&#8230;.</p>
