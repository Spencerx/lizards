				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has long been a challenge to use MS Silverlight based websites on linux systems.  Especially in The Netherlands this is a big hurdle as many (&gt;80%) of the secondary school websites that pupils must use to communicate with their school (for homework, marks, etc) are equipped with Silverlight.  Yes, really&#8230; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="&#x1f641;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Fortunately at the end of August 2013 I discovered <a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html#section_1_4" title="An incredible solution ">pipelight</a>, a very smart idea to use MS Silverlight based website natively on Linux.  The problem was however to find a working pipelight package for openSUSE.  As there was none, I decided to build one myself using the incredible <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/">openSUSE Build Service</a>.  It was quite a quest to obtain a working package, but due to very good cooperation with the pipelight developers, I&#8217;m now able to present a working pipelight package to the openSUSE community.  Oh, and while working on the package I reported a bug via the bug report system, that was solved and published via an rpm package within 1 hour after reporting it (that was during out of office hours).  Indeed within 1 hour after reporting the problem it was; accepted, investigated, analysed, fixed, tested, handed over to me, packaged, tested and published!  The amazing world of Open Source Software!</p>
<p>Pipelight works okay for the following sites (<a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html#section_5">among many others</a>): arte, LOVEFiLM, Netflix, Magister based NL schoolwebsites, WATCHEVER, etc.  View the complete list on the <a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html">pipelight website</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://fds-team.de/cms/articles/2013-08/pipelight-using-silverlight-in-linux-browsers.html#section_1_4">installation instructions</a> are on the pipelight website.  Be aware though, that pipelight requires the wine package that is provided via the home:rbos:pipelight repository.  With any other wine package, pipelight will (very likely) not work.  If you rely on your currently installed wine package and installed MS applications and are unsure that the wine package provided via the home:rbos:pipelight repository will leave your currently in use MS applications untouched: don&#8217;t install pipelight (or only after making very good backups).  You can always start by installing pipelight in a virtual machine.</p>
<p>Have fun with pipelight.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Brief report on the Wine talk at LinuxTag 2011 in Berlin, by Christian Boltz and Marcus Meissner. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Christian Boltz and myself held a quite successful talk on Wine on the 2010 openSUSE conference, we decided to again hold a talk at Germanys largest Linux fair, Linux Tag 2011 in Berlin.</p>
<p>We again ran the pun talk &#8220;Wine&#8221; (not) the Emulator vs &#8220;Wine&#8221; the beverage, with Christian talking about life and work at a vineyard and his wine grower community at Deutsches Weintor.</p>
<p>Included in this talk was a Wine tasting of 4 different kinds of Wine, as grown in the area were Christian lives.</p>
<p>His stories on Vineyard activities and the processing from grape to wine interluded with myself talking about Wine the Emulator, its historical and statistical parts, game support and futures.</p>
<p>Around 70 people  enjoyed our light hearted wrap up talk of this Linux Tag conference.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some time I follow the <a href="forums.opensuse.org" target="_blank">openSUSE Forums</a> which provide me a very interesting view about what our users do with openSUSE. I&#8217;ve noticed there are some relevant questions about Wine once in a while in the Games forums.</p>
<p>A few time ago one of my friends nagged me a lot to do a couple of levels in <a href="http://www.lotro.com/?lang=en_GB&amp;" target="_blank">Lord of the Rings Online</a> which has a &#8216;Free Play&#8217; plan in Europe. People can create an account and play for free the game with some restrictions (contents, equipment, items, etc). Players also have the option of using the online game store to unlock several aspects of the game. I&#8217;ve used a free play account for this, as I don&#8217;t really dedicate much time to it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve downloaded and installed the game in a Windows 7 computer (abour 10.5GB&#8217;s),  updated it and it works as expected. My laptop has somehow better hardware and I&#8217;ve decided to see how it would run under openSUSE through wine! On <a href="http://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">WineHQ</a> there&#8217;s some extensive know-how shared by the community about this game&#8230; for my little experiment I&#8217;ve used the following:</p>
<p>* Lord of the Rings Online installation files pulled from the installer (since I had previously downloaded the game on a Windows machine, I&#8217;ve used those files to avoid downloading 10.5GB&#8217;s again).<br />
* Wine 32 bits (1.3.12, shipped with openSUSE, LotRO requires also wine-gecko);<br />
* openSUSE 11.4 x86_64;<br />
* ATI FireGL drivers, release 11.2;<br />
* PyLotRO Launcher (written in Python, used to launch LOTRO since the normal Turbine .NET launcher has some serious issues);</p>
<p>Looking at everything written on WineHQ about LotRO it seems quite a hard task to get this running, luckily it&#8217;s actually the opposite&#8230; pretty much a quick step, though time consuming due to the size of the game. Here&#8217;s the procedures:</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: normal"><strong>Installing wine on openSUSE 11.4</strong></span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Installing wine on openSUSE is pretty easy (like any other software package). Make sure you are networked and open your favourite terminal emulator and type in the following command: <em><strong>zypper install wine wine-gecko</strong></em>. Zypp client will pull all the required dependencies and install the software. Please be aware that your system needs to have 3D capable drivers, often proprietary drivers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Installing Lord of the Rings Online</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As I&#8217;ve stated previously, I&#8217;ve had available the installation cache files from a previous Windows installation which made my life easier (around 10.5GB). If this is not your case, you can look into WineHQ and check how it goes with the installer. An interesting thread can be found <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=21337" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>When one installs LOTRO on a Windows Machine it will create a folder on the Desktop called LOTRO_* which will contain a local cache of the files necessary to install the game. Inside of this folder there&#8217;s a &#8216;lotrosetup.exe&#8217; runs the installer. To start the installation is quite easy&#8230; open a terminal (with normal user), navigate to the directory where we have the cache files from the installer and run: <strong>wine lotrosetup.exe</strong>. The installer window pops up preceded by a small splash screen. Follow the instructions on the screen and wait until it deploys the game (took around 30/40 minutes).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PyLotRO Launcher for Linux</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s ways to run the game and the Turbine launcher (.NET) isn&#8217;t really friendly of wine. I&#8217;ve decided to go for PyLotRO which is a small launcher written in Python. I&#8217;ve made a small test package which is available on my test repository in OBS (<a href="http://build.opensuse.org" target="_blank">openSUSE Build Service</a>) and called it python-lotro. You can find it <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=pylotro&amp;project=home%3Aketheriel" target="_blank">here</a>. For openSUSE 11.4 it can download this RPM, <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/ketheriel/openSUSE_Factory/noarch/python-lotro-0.1.14-4.1.noarch.rpm" target="_blank">python-lotro-0.1.14-4.1.noarch.rpm</a> and install it with: <em><strong>sudo zypper install python-lotro-0.1.14-4.1.noarch.rpm</strong></em>. This will also create a link on your Games menu entry (works in GNOME, never tested on KDE).</p>
<p>You have the Linux launcher installer and are a tiny step away from being able to play LoTRO&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Updating the Game&#8230;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>PyLotRO provides a small interface with the very basic functionality available from the Turbine Launcher. Allows to configure wine debugging output and patch the game amongst other features. Here&#8217;s a small screenshot how it&#8217;s looks:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screenshot-Lord-of-the-Rings-Online-Launcher-for-Linux.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6783" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screenshot-Lord-of-the-Rings-Online-Launcher-for-Linux.png" alt="" width="808" height="492" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screenshot-Lord-of-the-Rings-Online-Launcher-for-Linux.png 808w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screenshot-Lord-of-the-Rings-Online-Launcher-for-Linux-300x182.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></a></p>
<p>To update the game, it&#8217;s only required to hit the &#8216;<strong>Tools</strong>&#8216; menu and select &#8216;<strong>Patch</strong>&#8216;. This will access the game contents, download, decrypt and update the game to the latest version. Due to the size of the game it really takes a bit of time, so be patient.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Before launching the game make sure that you have 3D effects disabled on the Desktop (ex: disable compiz or composite in Kwin). If this step isn&#8217;t done, the game might suffer of great performance issues and weird behavior. If something looks fishy, then that&#8217;s because you forgot this step. This also made me think in one thing&#8230; What impact will Unity and gnome-shell have in cases like this&#8230; when the accelerated 3D Desktop will generate performance issues in applications like in this case&#8230; something to look for in the nearby future&#8230;</p>
<p>After the update it&#8217;s possible to login into the game, configure the options and give it a go&#8230; You will need a game account first than can be created for free (Europe only as far as I am aware, the game seems to be under subscription in the US), make sure you download the European client as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gameplay</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The game tries to detect the best configuration for your system (Low in my case)&#8230; I&#8217;ve forced it to Very High, selected my native resolution and gave it a go. The game is fluid enough, though lags a bit in big cities (ex: Bree), this is somehow something to expect, the same happens in Windows. While I haven&#8217;t seen much problems with performance, I&#8217;ve disabled dynamic lighting and it&#8217;s somehow a bit better. The runs nice and everything seems to work.</p>
<p>I know many tutorials talk about winetricks and d3dx9&#8230; I&#8217;ve not did such things and the game runs very nice with the native wine dll&#8217;s without having the need of installing Microsoft&#8217;s DirectX files.</p>
<p>This was a very pleasant experience, and it really surprised me on the positive. OpenSUSE has a very nice version of wine capable of running at least LotRO and World of Warcraft without any issues! It&#8217;s something that is worth trying with openSUSE!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I guess everyone notice, <a href="http://google.com/chrome/">Google</a> has released their own Browser called Chrome. Based on Webkit (based on KHTML of KDE fame) it is a small, fast and foremost secure webbrowser. And if you are reading this, you likely know that it does not work on Linux, but only on Windows.</p>
<p>But wait &#8230; we have the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Wine">Windows Emulator Wine</a> and I am one of its developers&#8230;</p>
<p>This also explains the first comment from a colleague on Wednesday morning was: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you have fixed Wine to run it yet?!?&#8221; We tried together to get the online installer to run, but not successful.</p>
<p>Over night however some other folks found out how to do it by using the offline installer.</p>
<p>So how to install Chrome:</p>
<p>1. Get the Wine 1.1.3 from the openSUSE buildservice Emulators:Wine repository.</p>
<p>   Its available via the Community Repositories Module in YAST2 on openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0,<br />
   after adding this repository upgrade the <i>wine</i> package.</p>
<p>   This piece of code run as root will do it on openSUSE 11.0:<br />
   <code>zypper sa http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine/openSUSE_11.0/ Wine<br />
   zypper in wine</code></p>
<p>   All other steps are done as desktop user from a regular shell.</p>
<p>2. Download the Chrome Offline Installer</p>
<p>    <code>wget http://gpdl.google.com/chrome/install/149.27/chrome_installer.exe</code></p>
<p>3. Install richedit native libraries.</p>
<p>    While Wine contains richedit libraries they are not yet up to the task to help Chrome yet.<br />
    (This is likely to be fixed soon.)</p>
<p>    To install them run:<br />
    <code>winetricks riched20 riched30</code></p>
<p>3. Run Chrome Installer</p>
<p>   <code>wine chrome_installer.exe</code></p>
<p>   This will popup a dialog where you can press return until Chrome itself starts. </p>
<p>   Since we need to supply Chrome with some Options to make it work with current Wine, you need<br />
   to close it again. Click anyway any crash messageboxes.</p>
<p>4. Run Chrome itself</p>
<p>   We need to supply Chrome with some additional commandline options to make it run with Wine,<br />
   so we need to do start it by hand (instead of clicking on the convenient Desktop Icon already there).</p>
<p>   <code>cd ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/profiles/*/*/*/Google/Chrome/Application<br />
   wine chrome.exe --new-http --in-process-plugins</code></p>
<p>5. Surf!</p>
<p>And of course the obligatory screenshot:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcusmeissner/2828814626/" title="chrome wine opensuse by Marcus Meissner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3005/2828814626_f7a1ef106d_m.jpg" width="240" height="229" alt="chrome wine opensuse" /></a></p>
<p>Most of the funny workarounds above will actually vanish in the next Wine releases, now that the Wine developers can actively debug it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=13635">WineHQ Application database entry</a> has the ongoing discussion of getting it to work and links to the Wine bugzilla entries.</p>
