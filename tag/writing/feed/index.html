				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people has the talent to write good stories. Probably most uses only a paper and a pen for this task. However, if you are searching for a respective tool, I maybe have another solution: <a href="http://storybook.intertec.ch">Storybook</a>!</p>
<p><span id="more-1167"></span><br />
Storybook describes itself as &#8220;a free, open source novel-writing tool for creative writers, novelists and authors which will help you to keep an overview of multiple plot-lines while writing books, novels or other written works. Storybook assists you in structuring your book&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot:</p>
<div id="attachment_1169" style="width: 879px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/storybook-main.png" alt="Main Window of Storybook" width="869" height="533" class="size-full wp-image-1169" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/storybook-main.png 869w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/storybook-main-300x184.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Main Window of Storybook</p></div>
<p>It offers a lot of more features than I can describe, so better look at the homepage. You can get it from <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/thomas-schraitle/">my OBS repository</a> (package storybook).</p>
<p>Have fun and write lots of good stories! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
