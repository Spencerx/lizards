				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KDE 4 is definitively my daily desktop environment, although it&#8217;s not yet mature like the 3.5.x branch i consider it enough stable and usable, but sometime the default settings and the few time available, don&#8217;t help us to appreciate it, so let&#8217;s resume some little tip for beginners that feel lost with everything new and don&#8217;t want waste their time.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want<strong> Delete/Move items over the panel</strong> click the Plasma icon in the right edge: a second panel will help you to insert other plasmoids, resize the panel, align it, activate the auto-hide, and plus will be enabled the drag&#8217;n drop over any item for change their positions</li>
<li>The <strong>Show Desktop icon</strong> is one of the most feature i use, unfortunately it&#8217;s hide between the other plasmoids and his place is taken from the <strong>Show Dashboard</strong>. If you need see quickly your desktop then right click over the panel and select <em>Panel Settings &gt; Add Object</em> then select <em>Windows and Tasks</em> and drag <em>Show Desktop</em> plasmoid over the panel. Add a key shortuct is easy: right click over the icon submitted and select <em>Show Desktop Settings</em> then click over the button and insert it (if <em>Win + D</em> sound more familiar you can use it too)</li>
<li><strong>Link your software over the main Panel or the Desktop</strong> with few steps: just search it into the main menu (<em>Alt + F1</em>) and drag&#8217;n drop over the Panel/Desktop. If a folder is dragged from Dolphin/Konqueror over the Desktop you may create, through the popup menu, a <em>Folder View</em>, a <em>Lancelot menu</em> or just an icon that will start a dolphin&#8217;s session</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t like the Plasma Desktop? Switch back to the old style just selecting the <strong>Folder View</strong> under <em>Desktop Settings &gt; Type</em></li>
<li>Everyone has just installed KDE 4 want see the <strong>Cube</strong> and probabily this effect it&#8217;s already activated through KWin, then press <em>CTRL + F11</em>, switch the faces with the <em>arrow keys</em> and select your desktop pressing <em>Return</em></li>
<li><strong>KSnapshot doesn&#8217;t popup with PrtScr</strong>? If you miss this feature<em>, </em> then fix it: launch <em>systemsettings</em>, select <em>Input Actions</em> and create a new global shortcut (Command/URL) into the tree list through the contextual menu, fill the multiline text field with a comment, set <em>PrtScr</em> as key, and insert the command <em>ksnapshot</em>, then save. With the  same system you can associate  your favorite software with  a combo key (think on it if you want launch<strong> dolphin</strong> with <em>Win + E</em> or <strong>kfind</strong> with <em>Win + F</em>)</li>
<li>The <strong>Grid View</strong> is something useful for watch and select any window opened in your desktop, try it with <em>Ctrl + F9</em> or <em>Ctrl + F10</em> if you want see the windows opened in every Desktop. This feature is also available for align the Desktops in the same view (<em>Ctrl + F8</em>)</li>
<li><strong>KDE 4 seem slow</strong>? Before say it try to disable some effect under <em>systemsettings &gt;</em> <em>Desktop</em>. Usually i disable the effects related to the windows minimization (slow redesign) and move (transparence), but if your system is very old, before to leave KDE 4 disable them completely</li>
<li><strong>How to show/hide the </strong><strong>invisible files</strong>? Both in Dolphin or Konqueror switch their visualization with <em>Alt + .</em></li>
<li><strong>Klipper</strong> improve the <strong>clipboard&#8217;s system</strong>: use <em>Ctrl + Alt + V</em> for paste one of the last ten, twenty,&#8230; items already copied, it support also the <em>actions</em> (<em>Ctrl + Alt + X</em> for enable/disable) configurables through regular expressions, they allow to open the string selected with a particular program. Try this feature selecting this: http://www.opensuse.org</li>
<li>Tired to navigate the main menu? <strong>Krunner</strong> can help you: call it with <em>Alt + F2</em> and begin to write in the text box a part of the application&#8217;s name you would like start and it will search the string between the whole menu. Krunner can also open a folder, search between contacts or bookmarks, convert units or execute little math operations, look <a href="http://userbase.kde.org/Tutorials/Krunner" target="_blank">the official page on KDE.org</a> for more details.</li>
<li>Some <strong>plasmoid</strong> look very useful, not only gadgets for fill your Desktop: webmaster should love the <strong>Color Picker</strong> and keep it fix in the main panel; the <strong>Timer</strong> will help us to manage our time counting down a configurable interval; <strong>Notes</strong> is a post-it system; <strong>Quick Access</strong> is another way to reach our files and folder and navigate between them directly from the main panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now, hope it help to enjoy a bit more this fantastic Desktop Environment, any new hint is welcome, just leave a comment below <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
