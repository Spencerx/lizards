				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>For some time I wanted to check out GNOME3 and gnome-shell&#8230; My current chipset is ATI M92 RV710 and while the thermal performance with the proprietary driver is somewhat what I expect, the open source radeon driver does overheat my laptop a lot compared to flgrx. For the time being, fglrx isn&#8217;t really a choice because it just borgs the &#8216;activities&#8217; bar on top&#8230; And until ATI fixes their driver, there&#8217;s no other choice than running with the standard radeon drm driver, which does provide a very pleasant experience with GNOME3 / gnome-shell.</p>
<p>For all that matters, KMS is to be enabled, period, full stop. And from this point&#8230; we have two options regarding power management:</p>
<p>1. Dynamic Frequency switching (not really working for me);<br />
2. Profile based frequency switching (does provide what I need);</p>
<p>For all that matters regarding &#8216;profile based frequency switching&#8217; we have 5 profiles available:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;default&#8221; uses the default clocks and does not change the power state. This is the default behavior.</li>
<li>&#8220;auto&#8221; selects between &#8220;mid&#8221; and &#8220;high&#8221; power states based on the whether the system is on battery power or not. The &#8220;low&#8221; power state are selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.</li>
<li>&#8220;low&#8221; forces the gpu to be in the low power state all the time. Note that &#8220;low&#8221; can cause display problems on some laptops; this is why auto only uses &#8220;low&#8221; when displays are off.</li>
<li>&#8220;mid&#8221; forces the gpu to be in the &#8220;mid&#8221; power state all the time. The &#8220;low&#8221; power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.</li>
<li>&#8220;high&#8221; forces the gpu to be in the &#8220;high&#8221; power state all the time. The &#8220;low&#8221; power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, what I did might not be an option to everyone, but for sure it does provide a nice solution for my problem&#8230; So be mindful of that&#8230; this is a personal preference based on the fact that I don&#8217;t require intensive GPU usage, neither I run intensive GPU requiring applications within GNOME3/gnome-shell (I have a normal openSUSE 11.4 with GNOME 2.32.x with fglrx dual boot config for those apps).</p>
<p>The first thing we might want to do is to switch to profile based frequency switching&#8230; how do we this? As root:</p>
<p>[code] echo profile &gt; /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method[/code]</p>
<p>Now we have to pick one of those 5 profiles&#8230; and since I&#8217;ve already stated&#8230; I want the &#8216;low&#8217; profile since I don&#8217;t really do much intensive GPU work&#8230;</p>
<p>[code] echo low &gt; /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile[/code]</p>
<p>Now&#8230; you might want to check out the different profiles and the different clocks used&#8230; this can be done through:</p>
<p>[code] ﻿cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/radeon_pm_info[/code]</p>
<p>and will report something like this:</p>
<p>[code]﻿linux-331w:~ # cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/radeon_pm_info<br />
default engine clock: 680000 kHz<br />
current engine clock: 299530 kHz<br />
default memory clock: 800000 kHz<br />
current memory clock: 249750 kHz<br />
voltage: 900 mV<br />
PCIE lanes: 16[/code]</p>
<p>This one is using the &#8216;low&#8217; profile&#8230; Feel free to test stuff around and find which one better answers your needs&#8230; Also there&#8217;s far more that can be done&#8230; I hope this helps ATI users with DRM driver to bring out the best of your system and improves your GNOME3 / gnome-shell experience, at so that you can run it with good thermal performance without fglrx.</p>
