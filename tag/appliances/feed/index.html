				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We first released <a title="WebYaST Portal" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:WebYaST">WebYaST</a> in January this year, but while we did release it under Open Source licensing straight from the get-go, we were so busy working on the <a title="Appliance Toolkit 1.1" href="http://www.novell.com/products/suse-appliance-toolkit/"> SUSE Appliance Program</a> that we could not properly test it to also ship an openSUSE packaged version &#8211; yet.</p>
<p>That changed with our newest release, and those of you building openSUSE images in <a title="SUSE Studio" href="http://susestudio.com">SUSE Studio</a> can now add WebYaST to any build with just another click in the selections, as James Tan documented in exquisite snapshotting detail in his <a title="WebYaST in Studio" href="http://blog.susestudio.com/2010/09/one-click-webyast.html">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Internally, we have been mostly focusing on Appliance use, albeit with increasingly frequent forays into the land of more general-purpose Enterprise system administration.   While the current release is quite complete for its Appliance Toolkit use case, it still has a way to go to match the completeness provided by &#8220;classic YaST&#8221; to openSUSE users.   While over time the array of modules will steadily grow, there are two remarks that I want to make today: for one, WebYaST is to me an extremely exciting bit of configuration and monitoring software, not just because of its elegant look and web-based interface,  but particularly because of the cleverness of simplified interaction in some modules (take a spin of the Firewall module to see exactly what I mean).   The second bit is that, because of WebYaST&#8217;s newness, the space is ripe for Contributors with creative ideas to come in with Community modules: access to configuration and monitoring features over a Web UI is a powerful mixture, especially when combined with the rise of Smartphone and Tablet computing we are seeing&#8230; just a thought I wanted to leave your fertile minds with!</p>
<p><a title="Documentation" href="http://doc.opensuse.org/products/WebYaST/webyast-user/index.html">Some</a> <a title="More documentation" href="http://www.novell.com/documentation/webyast/">documentation</a> to oil your synapses <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Happy Hacking! -F2</p>
