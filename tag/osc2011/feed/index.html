				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>﻿The annual get-together of openSUSE community, <em>openSUSE Conference</em> kicks at 11-14 September 2011 in lovely Nürnberg, Germany. This year we have more than 100 events scheduled. What makes this year extra special is that <em>SUSE Labs Conference</em> will be hosted along with the <em>openSUSE Conference</em> bringing many technical talks and workshops.</p>
<p>You might not know SUSE Labs beforehand, its the group of people who hacks on low level toolchain stuff like gcc (GNU Compiler Collection) , gdb (GNU Debugger) , binutils and others. So you can expect deep technical talks at the conference, starting with the<em><strong> Link Time Optimization (LTO) in GCC </strong></em>talk<em><strong> </strong></em>on Sunday by <em><strong>Jan Hubicka</strong></em> who works at suse.cz (SUSE Czech Republic) and is a prominent gcc hacker for quite a long time. LTO is a hot topic for any software project given the fact that it improves the overall application performance in most cases. So if you want to squueze more performance out of your own project(s), you shouldn&#8217;t miss Jan&#8217;s talk.</p>
<p>On Monday another member of suse.cz <strong><em>Jiri Slaby</em></strong> will give a talk titled <em><strong>Static Code Checking &#8212; the State of the Art</strong></em> . Recently static code checking got more exposure with the bugs found in projects like Apple&#8217;s <strong><em>clang</em></strong> C/C++ compiler, Google&#8217;s <strong><em>Chrome</em></strong> web browser and also id Software&#8217;s <strong><em>John Carmack</em></strong> praising the process for finding the bugs in their upcoming game title <strong><em>Rage</em></strong>. So if you are found of coding in a static language like C/C++ you should be attending this talk. Also during the day, visitors will also have a chance to attend the <em><strong>gdb workshop</strong></em> to teach some tricks to our beloved debugger gdb. Given that gdb is a powerful tool with an awkward interface I hope to learn more about using it like a pro.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the kernel development, you will be happy to know that two kernel debugging sessions <strong><em>Setting up and Analyzing Kernel Crash Dumps</em></strong> and<em><strong> Kernel Debugging / Instrumentation with Systemtap</strong></em> will be presented by <em><strong>Stefan Seyfried</strong></em> and <strong><em>Michel Rode</em></strong> from <em><strong>B1 Systems GmbH</strong></em>. Also yours truly, together with <strong><em>Vincent Untz</em></strong> will do a workshop titled <strong><em>How to contribute to Factory</em></strong> to get our hands dirty on the basic openSUSE Factory packaging and submission workflow. We hope to give a basic to intermediate introduction to openSUSE Factory packaging with solutions to common encountered problems.</p>
<p>Tuesday starts with another kernel debugging talk <em><strong>Linux IO Tracing</strong></em> by <em><strong>Jan Kara</strong></em> which will be followed by another talk from <strong><em>Jiri Slaby</em></strong> titled<em><strong> Automatic Regression Testing</strong></em> which hopefully will be interesting for all developers. In the evening there will an <em><strong>Advanced Packaging</strong></em> talk by<em><strong> Lars Vogdtand</strong></em> and <strong><em>Pascal Bleser</em></strong> which might teach you a packaging trick or two.</p>
<p>If performance is your thing, you shouldn&#8217;t miss <em><strong>Monitoring with Performance Co-Pilot</strong></em> talk by <em><strong>David Disseldorp </strong></em>on Friday. And just before we wrap up the conference <em><strong>Conny Seidel</strong></em> from <em><strong>AMD</strong></em> <strong><em>(Advanced Micro Devices)</em></strong> will give a talk titled <em><strong>Linux Testing &#8211; Complexity in a nutshell</strong></em> which will give an overview of Linux testing architecture used over in AMD. It will be interesting to learn about a real-world Linux testing setup.</p>
<p>So that was a small glimpse of what is coming. Remember that registration for openSUSE Conference is free, so hop over <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//confRegistrationFormDisplay.py/display?confId=2">here</a> for registration. We hope to see you there!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Its quite some work to get to a reasonable schedule for a FOSS conference done.  You want a balanced program with topics where all visitors can find their interests in. Moreover the level of the talks must be taken care of as well as there should be gravitation centers for key topics within the community. As you usually also seek out for new community members with a conference, some topics which attract new people are also a very good idea. And all that needs to be sorted between rooms with different sizes, the times people can be around, the tracks you think are useful on the event  and such. Quite some parameters to take into account. </p>
<p>That said, I am very happy that we could issue the <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/timetable">schedule</a> for the <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org">openSUSE Conference 2011</a> today.</p>
<p>For conference organization there is tooling. Or should I say: Should be? Given the huge amount of FOSS conferences around, the number of free alternatives  of conference organization  systems is fairly small. We decided to go again with <a href="http://indico-software.org/">Indico</a>, a python based system developed by <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/">CERN</a>. It provides support for the whole conference life cycle such as the call for abstracts, the internal judging process, the scheduling and such. With nice help from the developers we got it running smoothly and integrated. Sometimes the interface is not really straightforward, but finally its a very  feature rich yet flexible tool that feels like it has managed some large (CERN) conferences already.</p>
<p>For the <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org">openSUSE conference</a> <strong>102</strong> contributions were scheduled into four rooms in four days, so it will be quite a exhausting event :-). Unfortunately we still had to reject quite some submissions as the program is stuffed already. Please bear with us.</p>
<p>This year we are really happy to have a joint event with the former SUSE Labs Conference for the first time. That not only brings a lot of high potential speaker to the event, but also much more low level topics around kernel, gcc and such. I think we lacked that a bit at the last conference. Also cool that Greg KH, well known kernel hacker, will enlighten us with a keynote.</p>
<p>Beside the low level topics, we will hear a lot about community affairs, such as social skills for geeks or impressions from our ambassadors work. Another big block is around packaging and the organization and management of openSUSE Factory, our next stable distribution. Some knowledge sharing is always appreciated, I personally look forward to &#8220;Working Effectively with GIT&#8221; as I am still dreaming of svn in the nights <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> And what we need to continue to grow our identity as openSUSE project are contributions around our setup and the relationship to SUSE, the commercial offering of SUSE and the importance of openSUSE in that. Michael Miller, SUSE Vice President of Global Alliances &#038; Marketing, will give a keynote here, and there are other talks in that space.</p>
<p>The motto of osc2011 is <strong>rwx³</strong> which is a synonym of the idea of interactivity and creativity on the conference. That is a success already as more than the half of the contributions to the conference are BoFs, Workshops or hacking sessions. You do not have to fear to fall asleep in lengthy talks instead you will do stuff <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>And finally there is the venue. If you have been to the conference last year I need to say its different this year. Nobody will serve you Coke, instead with <a href="http://www.zentrifuge-nuernberg.de/">Zentrifuge</a> you are at a place where usually artists work and do exhibitions. This spirit of hands-on work quickly jumped over on us as the orga team and we are sure that spirit is good for openSUSE <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I hope you have <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//confRegistrationFormDisplay.py/display?confId=2">registered</a> for oSC 2011 already&#8230;.<br />

<p>As you know, the third international <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org">openSUSE Conference</a> is happening in a couple of weeks. You already should be <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//confRegistrationFormDisplay.py/display?confId=2">registered</a>. For the organization teams that means they are really coming onto speed now and it starts to feel dizzy.</p>
<p>We had a couple of public meetings which resulted in a nice <a title="Conference TODO" href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_todo_list" target="_blank">list of stuff to do</a>, like organizing hardware for the venue, set up internet, foods and drinks and so on. This is all done by community members and open for your help. If you want to help, you&#8217;re more than welcome to contribute to the conferences success.  A good start is to subscribe to the mailinglist opensuse-conference@opensuse.org .</p>
<p>If you prefer to give a hand during the conference days, also great, we are looking for <strong>volunteers</strong>. Many hands are needed to get the event going and it would be good if we could share the work so that it&#8217;s more fun for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Please</strong> go through the list on <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_volunteers">the volunteers page</a> and find where you could jump in and help. Simply add your name or nick into the list where you feel comfortable to help.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks a lot!</strong></p>
