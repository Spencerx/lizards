				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>some code was added to the buildservice backend already that generates Hermes notifications. That means that Hermes is getting closer, I will work this week to start a first test with Hermes on the production build service.</p>
<p>So let me introduce Hermes a bit.</p>
<p>Hermes is a system that helps it&#8217;s user to get back the decision about who is sending a message when and in which way. Using Hermes it is up to the user to decide if a message comes through at all, when and in which way. Hermes is going to be the central part of notifications in the openSUSE Buildservice.</p>
<p>Digest messages will be supported through Hermes. That means that messages (mostly automatically generated) of the same <em>type</em> coming regularly can be combined to one message combining all the bits. For example, imagine a notification about a package build fail. It might not make sense to send lets say 50 of them a day due to numerous rebuilds on different platforms that failed. It seems to be much more efficient to combine all these 50 to a digest message that lists all of the 50 fails. However, it&#8217;s users choice in Hermes.</p>
<p>The other important feature of Hermes is choice in the way of delivery. It is up to the user in which way the message comes through: Mail, RSS and jabber notification are already implemented in beta stadium, others may follow. It&#8217;s users choice based on the message type when and in which way the message is delivered.</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/logotype_wing.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-67" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/logotype_wing.png" alt="Hermes Logo" width="128" height="128" /></a>The backend already has some code in it to notify Hermes. I hope I will be able to make let&#8217;s say some RSS feeds or mail running this week, especially for the submit requests. That would be another step into collaboration with the buildservice.</p>
<p>And since I seem to talk a lot about Hermes these days, Robert was cool enough to come up with a very cool logo for the (still little) Hermes. Do you like it? I think it is <strong>awesome</strong> &#8211; kind of 1960&#8217;s aircraft company <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>Thank you very much, Robert! </p>
