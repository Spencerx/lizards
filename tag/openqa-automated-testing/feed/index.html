				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might have read <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/11/29/announcing-factory-tested/">the announcement of the factory-tested repo</a> (or not, because it did not go on planet.o.o). There have been many additions to the testing during the last eight weeks.</p>
<p>openQA.o.o is a machine running automated software tests all the time to decide if factory-tested can be updated. If you think, this was boring, you might find out that it is not, since every testrun generates a video of approx 4 minutes that can be conveniently viewed in firefox.</p>
<p>You can view those test results on <a href="http://openqa.opensuse.org/results/">the openQA page</a>.</p>
<p>And those are the updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have added testing of development repos, so that it is now possible to detect bugs before they even get into Factory (most of those tests have &#8220;devel&#8221; at the end of their name). In fact, this has already found two such bugs.</li>
<li>The test system&#8217;s hardware was upgraded with a sponsored SSD and the software adapted to allow running multiple tests in parallel (using <em>make -j3</em>)</li>
<li>I have updated the web-interface to use the nice Bento theme</li>
<li>And I found yet another cool use-case for automated testing: it allows to bisect bugs. I did a binary search in old results for <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=665413">a live-installer bug</a> which made it really easy to find the causing commit. However, seeing how long such a bug went unnoticed, made me think, that it would be nice if more people would check the results for anomalies, since not all of those can easily be auto-detected. As this just needs a firefox and little time, this is pretty easy to do. Much easier than to actually setup a test-system in any case.</li>
<li>An IRC notification bot was added, keeping #opensuse-openqa updated with new test results</li>
<li>Then, I am looking for additional <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2011-01/msg00228.html">automatic test-scripts</a>, that also work standalone on an openSUSE install. It is especially important to test high-impact things. Things that break often or block many users if they break. And it would be nice to have a small result range such as OK|fail|unknown or it should at least be mappable to such.</li>
<li>JÃ¼rgen Weigert has packaged <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=sikuli&amp;baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.3">sikuli</a>, so it is easy to create GUI tests with it, that could then be included in the test-suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there are still some things on the ToDo list&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Hermes integration to get email alerts and RDF feeds for newsreaders</li>
<li>Have more test variants auto-scheduled (-live and -dup)</li>
<li>Find a way to have Add-On-Repos with custom priority (otherwise Factory packages might be used, as happened for kernel-default-2.6.37-rc7) &#8211; using linuxrc&#8217;s driverupdate feature could be one way.</li>
</ul>
<p>your input is highly appreciated</p>
