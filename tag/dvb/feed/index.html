				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I tried to get a DVB-T card to work with a new antenna on a new 13.1 install.<br />
I know it was working, because I ran it with 12.3 on this machine last year.</p>
<p>hwinfo &#8211;tv<br />
showed<br />
  Model: &#8220;Hauppauge computer works WinTV HVR-1110&#8221;<br />
  Vendor: pci 0x1131 &#8220;Philips Semiconductors&#8221;<br />
  Device: pci 0x7133 &#8220;SAA7131/SAA7133/SAA7135 Video Broadcast Decoder&#8221;</p>
<p>So after plugging everything in, I started kaffeine, which still knew about all local channels, but could not tune.<br />
<a href="http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hauppauge_WinTV-HVR-1110">http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hauppauge_WinTV-HVR-1110</a> gave the important hint that one needs a firmware file. After that was in /lib/firmware/dvb-fe-tda10046.fw and after a reboot, came the next try. kaffeine now would show 99% SNR, so a good signal and even know about what is currently on air, however picture remained black.<br />
kaffeine hinted that it needs extra software, but could not find it, even though packman repos were available (annoying bug).</p>
<p><a href="http://opensuse-community.org/">http://opensuse-community.org/</a> finally helped &#8211; I needed the libxine2-codecs package from the packman repo.<br />
Now everything is working after less than an hour.</p>
