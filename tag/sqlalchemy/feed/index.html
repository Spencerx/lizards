				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend I spent some time on getting <a title="python-turbogears" href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=python-turbogears&amp;project=devel%3Alanguages%3Apython" target="_blank">python-turbogears</a> to build for Factory. In the process, I came across a spec file error which was causing not only python-turbogears to fail on Factory, but also <a title="Dozens of python packages fail in Factory due to filelist problem" href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=441794">dozens of other python packages</a>. The problem was the spec file line:</p>
<blockquote><p>%{__python} setup.py install &#8211;prefix=%{_prefix} &#8211;root=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT &#8211;record-rpm=INSTALLED_FILES</p></blockquote>
<p>Once I fixed this for python-turbogears and it&#8217;s dependent packages (the solution is to replace &#8211;record with &#8211;record-rpm), I was able to get version 1.0.6 building for Factory. There were a few other issues which needed to be resolved (some deprecated def as() functions in python-peak and python-ruledispatch were causing syntax errors on python 2.6 &#8211; because &#8216;as&#8217; is a reserved keyword), but finally I got it sorted out.</p>
<p>Once python 1.0.6 was successfully building on Factory, I decided to update the package to the most recent stable version of the 1.0.x package line from <a title="TurboGears Python Web Framework" href="http://www.turbogears.org">http://www.turbogears.org</a> &#8211; 1.0.7. I had to rewrite the infamous cherrypy2 patch for 1.0.7 and also had to update the python-elixir package (the older 0.5 Elixir was incompatible with python-sqlalchemy &gt;= 5) but now it builds properly.<br />
You can now download and install python-turbogears using:</p>
<blockquote><p>zypper in python-turbogears</p></blockquote>
<p>(if you have the devel:languages:python repository, of course).</p>
<p>Thanks to <a title="Peter Poeml" href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/author/poeml/">Peter Poeml</a> for his help packaging and fixing bugs.</p>
