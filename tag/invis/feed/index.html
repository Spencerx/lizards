				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://en.opensuse.org/images/9/9d/Invisopensuse.png" alt="Invis Server" align="right" /> Beside many other amazing things which happened at the <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2010/10/27/opensuse-conference-2010-impression/">openSUSE Conference 2010</a>, Stefan Schäfer gave a talk about his project called <a href="http://www.invis-server.org">Invis Server</a>. It is a very specific server solution for the small and medium business, based on the openSUSE distribution. The Invis Server is perfect software for all production installations in small  business use cases, also to be maintained by consultants in that space.</p>
<p>All needed services such as printing, mail, web and file server, database and groupware are there and get preconfigured at installation. For daily  operation in the users network, there is a simple yet powerful web interface.</p>
<p>In the discussion after the presentation it turned out that Stefan would be fine with moving the Invis Server Project nearer to the <a href="http://www.opensuse.org">openSUSE project</a> and get a larger community find together to power up the project on <a href="http://software.opensuse.org">openSUSE distributions</a>.</p>
<p>As a result we decided to found the <strong>openSUSE Invis Project</strong>. The idea is to create an openSUSE Distribution flavor with solid packages coming from <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory">openSUSE Factory</a> together with some specifically packaged sources ready to power the Invis Server. The openSUSE Buildservice will be used to build the needed packages and create the product images. The first tasks will be to clean up the package list and do some packaging to be able to create a convenient openSUSE-Invis CD.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-invis/">openSUSE-Invis Mailinglist</a> was set up and is waiting for your subscription. Please show up there soon to help us to move this idea forward.</p>
