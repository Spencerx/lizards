				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The boosters have been working on enhancing feature handling in openFATE so that features can be evaluated and implemented by everybody. The current state of the development is visible in the <a href="http://features.opensuse.org/preview" target="_blank">openFATE preview</a>. Now we can start evaluating features so that they get implemented.</p>

<p>The openFATE screening team needs further members, if you&#8217;re interested, please add yourself to the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate_screening#Participants" target="_blank">list</a> and start getting familiar with openFATE. To get familiar with it, it&#8217;s best starting with openSUSE 11.3 clean up.</p>
<p>We had a first <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate_screening#Bi-weekly_openFATE_screening_team_meeting" target="_blank">meeting</a> about openFATE on IRC yesterday and will have another one in two weeks time.</p>
<p>Right now the major tasks for the screening team are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate features for openSUSE 11.4</li>
<li>Push features forward</li>
<li>Define a proper process on how to evaluate features</li>
<li>Cleanup features from openSUSE 11.3</li>
</ul>
<p>I have written a proposal for the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate_screening_process" target="_blank">feature process</a> and would like feedback on that one on the opensuse-project mailing list.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Hennevogel">Henne Greenrock</a> sent a status report about the Boosters Standup-Meeting here he said that nothing happened to the <a href="http://features.opensuse.org">openFATE</a> sprint. Well, that&#8217;s only partly true, so it seems to be time to take a closer look and revitalize the project openFATE a bit.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s the matter with openFATE?</h3>
<p>We did a good <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2009/01/16/opensuse-project-opens-feature-tracking-with-openfate/">start</a> with openFATE to involve everybody who is interested into product planning. However, after the screening team was formed it turned out that some parts of the process are not yet working well. The biggest problem is still that the screening team members can not move features from state UNCONFIRMED to NEW which turned out to be crucial for a fluent process. So the Boosters picked up the task since we think this is a huge blocker to work together as a community effectivly.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Openfate_screening">openFATE Screening Page</a> lists a few more details about the openFATE screening team and the issues. </p>
<h3>How are we going to solve the issues?</h3>
<p>The Screening Team Members need additional rights. We will create a user group &#8220;openFATE Screener&#8221; which gives people in it additional rights in openFATE. For the time being, the group will be maintained within openFATE. Once we have <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Connect">connect.opensuse.org</a> in place, we will use it to maintain the group setting. The important bit here is to give the screeners group the ability to maintain itself, ie. add or remove members.</p>
<p>Being a screener will enable people to change status of a feature from <em>UNCONFIRMED</em> to <em>NEW</em>. That is a responsible task because being in state NEW, the feature goes through the whole mill of the process, also through product and project management for SLE products. We have to make sure to have high quality features here.</p>
<p>Futhermore the screeners will be able to add infoproviders to features in case they know who can help there which is also a very sensible task.</p>
<p>Another part to work on are notifications. People should be notified when they get added to a feature. We use <a href="http://hermes.opensuse.org">Hermes</a> for that (which is already working) so the only issue is that if people who get added to a feature are not subscribed to the certain notifications in Hermes, they do not receive anything. Which is per purpose as we want to leave the control to the users. The solution to that is to inform the screeners about the Hermes subscription status of the people added. If somebody is not subscribed, its on the screener to talk to the guy and convince him to join into the openFATE game. I don&#8217;t think it makes sense to subscribe users silently because that would take away control over their subscriptions and messages get ignored as spam in the end.</p>
<p>Last but not least we have to solve the &#8220;I am free, pick me!&#8221;-problem, which is about features that went through the decision process and would fit nicely into a product but have no developer implementing it yet. In the company process that means that a teamlead assigns a developer from his team on that. In the community we need to change that so that people can pick the feature themselves. That has some implications to the attached internal process, so that there are still some questions open. We have to investigate a bit on that.</p>
<h3>What has happened so far?</h3>
<p>I was able to change the keeperproxy, which is a security relevant proxy which filters data that is going to be exposed to the internet. Moreover I was kung-fuing through the Javascript in the openFATE webapp so that it is now possible to change the status if one is screener. I also added a screener attribute to the Person-Model in the openFATE rails app. Last but not least I added the basic API functionality to get and set subscriptions to Hermes.</p>
<h3>What needs to be done?</h3>
<p>Well, everything that is there is still rough and needs testing and polishing. Futhermore I added the remaining tasks to <a href="http://retro.opensuse.org">Retrospectiva</a>, please check there. </p>
<p>As usual we&#8217;re happy about your input on this!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://en.opensuse.org/images/7/72/Hackfife.png" alt="Hackweek Five Logo" align="left" margin="5px"/>I am really looking forward to the next Hackweek that we have in Novell &#8211; it will be in the week from <strong>7-11 of June 2010</strong>.<br />
In that week, Novell allows a whole lot of people to spend the full work time (and more <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> to work on whatever free software they want. That is really a huge thing, because we&#8217;re talking about hundrets of engineers.<br />
What everybody is working on is as said not at all prescribed, except that it should benefit the idea of free software. There is a <a href="https://features.opensuse.org/query/run?search_products%5B%5D=hackweek_5&#038;type=find">list maintained</a> of ideas which people have for <a href="https://features.opensuse.org/hackweek">Hackweek Five</a> in order to find somebody joining the team or to pick the idea up at all.<br />
The good thing now is that of course <a href="https://features.opensuse.org">openFATE</a> is used to maintain this list and thus it is open for the openSUSE Community to also add ideas, comment or vote on whats already there. This is of course no guarantee that the idea is going to be picked up but still. So everybody who thinks she has an idea that will inspire someone on Hackweek Five, feel free to add it to openFATE and talk about.<br />
Of course it is also possible and appreciated to work on Hackweek projects also as non Novell employee <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
Get in touch &#8211; it will be exciting!</p>
