<p style="margin-left:0.25em">
If running a booth is, for sure, an investment of time, energy and money (even if TSP contribute to help you), We often forget to say<br />
how much it&#8217;s important for our community and project.</p>
<p>
Booths makes openSUSE alive in all open source events! and it&#8217;s a great experience to live, for any of us.
</p>
<h3 style="clear:both;margin-top: 18px">Feel the beat!</h3>
<p>
I strongly believe that openSUSE has be to visible on events like KDE Akademy, Scale, Fosdem, Guadec.<br />
It&#8217;s not a question of &quot;Bang for the buck&quot;, than a simple obviousness:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://fosdem.org">Fosdem :</a></b> the biggest open source event in Europe (perhaps in the world) with more than 5000 hackers visiting.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale13x">Scale :</a></b> biggest event in North America with more than 3000 attendees</li>
<li><b><a href="https://www.guadec.org/">Guadec :</a></b> The annual conference of Gnome Hackers with lot of worldwide attendees</li>
<li><b><a href="http://akademy.kde.org/">KDE Akademy :</a></b> This year with around 150 active contributors coming from all over the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The obviousness is: if openSUSE has no booth there, you just see Ubuntu and Redhat, and let&#8217;s add Debian, Mageia etc for Fosdem or Scale.<br />
<img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/openSUSE-lizard0b.png" alt="openSUSE-lizard0b" width="300" height="161" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11007" /><br />
<br />
You all know how much I like our Geeko community. And when Akademy staff proposed us to run a booth, I said yes, great I will be there!<br />
After comparing ways to go to Brno, the Geeko&#8217;s car was the less expensive, and allow me to pick  the demo touch screen at SUSE Headquarter.<br />
So I took a full week off and drive 2000 kilometers to make it happens.
</p>

<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/openSUSE-lizard2.png" alt="openSUSE-lizard2" width="285" height="215" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11002" /></p>
<h3>Open the Fun can</h3>
<p>Running a booth is not that hard. You will find flyers in the booth box presenting openSUSE and related tools.<br />
There&#8217;s goodies like several kind of stickers, pens, USB flash keys, beer mate.<br />
About the poster, if not allowed on walls, let&#8217;s your creativity soar. Use boxes, a pen can also fix that big banner around the guard-rail.
</p>
<p>
On the human part, I would say than 3 persons is not too much. For example at Brno, the booth was very calm during the talks, but when the break<br />
arrives, you just see 30-50 people coming all at the same time in your direction.<span><b>Don&#8217;t run away!</b></span><br />
Organize yourself! For example one of the staff is delegated to spread swag, and drive attendees to the next expert.</p>
<p>Try to give as much as possible short-quality answers. </p>
<p>No matter if you are not at all technical guru, the <b>priority is to welcome</b> visitors and <b>listen to them</b>.<br />
<br />
If you have a demo computer, organize a bunch of bookmarks related to the conference subject inside the openSUSE community.<br />
At Brno, we were essentially demoing live factory with kde stable 4.14 and Factory with plasma5 and Frameworks 5, and all related web pages about kde on obs, wiki.<br />
Our moto was <b>What openSUSE can offer to KDE developers and contributors</b>.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s rarely on a booth that we can resolve a bug, but that&#8217;s where a beginning of a social interaction starts.<br />
<br />
Don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t awnser directly, offer a visit card, try to write down the contact details and its related question.<br />
You will, once the event is done, follow-up the contact with precious data, that will be really useful.
</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/openSUSE-lizard9.png" alt="openSUSE-lizard9" width="285" height="214" class="alignright size-full wp-image-11004" /></p>
<h3>Beat the Green next on stage</h3>
<p>
As any other contribution, running a booth is an awesome experience.<br />
It&#8217;s the best way to meet users and potential contributors.<br />
It&#8217;s always an opportunity to evolve, a challenge to be done and an experience to share.
</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/openSUSE-lizard1.png" alt="openSUSE-lizard1" width="285" height="190" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11001" /></p>
<p>
Back home, as usual a lot of things to do. But I feel important to share this experience in this lizard article, to post a few pictures, to share my<br />
feeling with my fellow openSUSE community. I hope to see more of you, taking the challenge to run one, next to your location.<br />
Do it, just run an openSUSE booth. You will learn a lot about you and our fellows, share with outcomers and meet others communities.

<p>My final words are a <b><em>big</em> Thank you</b> people who ran booth in the past,<br />
and I encourage all of you still hesitating.</p>
<p><b>See you soon on stage!</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Sint-Katelijne-Waver, Belgium currently <a title="Akademy" href="http://akademy2008.kde.org" target="_blank">Akademy</a>, the annual conference of the <a title="KDE Project" href="http://www.kde.org" target="_blank">KDE project</a> takes place. More than 300 people had a nice weekend listening to a whole bunch of very interesting talks of various topics around KDE. Over the week there will be special topics and BOFs and Hacking <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>While most of the topics were technically or very much related to KDE such as talks in the community track, on sunday there was a keynote from Cliff Schmidt from <a title="literacybridge.org" href="http://literacybridge.org" target="_blank">literacybridge.org</a> with the title <a title="Digital Audio to Reduce Illiteracy, Poverty and Disease" href="http://akademy2008.kde.org/conference/presentation/49.php">Digital Audio to Reduce Illiteracy, Poverty and Disease</a>. <a title="Danny" href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Dkukawka">Danny</a> has already <a title="blogged" href="http://dkukawka.blogspot.com/2008/08/akademy-2008-literacy-bridge.html">blogged</a> about it. It was a real mind opener that a lot of our efforts are useless to people who simply can not read. Cliff and the literacybridge project has a deep insight of how that can be improved. It was a real impressing talk and hope that the success for that project continues. Please check the project out.</p>
<p>On monday we had the general assembly of the <a title="KDE e.V." href="http://ev.kde.org" target="_blank">KDE e.V.</a> where <a title="Cornelius" href="http:http://news.opensuse.org/2008/06/07/people-of-opensuse-cornelius-schumacher/">Cornelius</a> and <a title="Aaron Seigo" href="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Aaron Seigo</a> were reelected into the board of the KDE e.V. Furthermore it was decided about a Community Code of Conduct for KDE that gives some hints how to behave in our community which seems to be needed these days and some other interesting and important stuff.</p>
<p>Today there is the &#8220;Embedded and Mobile Day&#8221; on Akademy which started with a talk around the <a title="Maemo platform" href="http://maemo.org" target="_blank">Maemo platform</a> where now Qt4 is available and everybody is invited to port interesting (KDE)  applications to it. Nokia was nice enough to give lots of <a title="N810 devices" href="http://http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/N810#Nokia_N810">N810 devices</a> to KDE developers. Very motivating <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>openSUSE is also very present on Akademy, not only as a sponsor. Coincidentially most of the conference speakers were standing very near to the openSUSE poster and as a result it was very prominent, but more important is that openSUSE is running on many desktops I saw&#8230;  Some people approached me and mentioned things like openSUSE 11.0 is really cool, KDE 4.1 is most easily installable with one-click-install, zypper rocks and other cool things. Nice.</p>
<p>Akademy is great and I enjoy some hacking on <a title="Kraft" href="http://kraft.sf.net" target="_blank">Kraft</a> now <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
