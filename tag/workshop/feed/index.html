<p>I&#8217;m contacting you personally, as an openSUSE Board member.</p>
<p>You certainly already know that we want to have a kicking openSUSE conference next 1st-4th May 2015 at the Haag (NL).</p>
<p>Thus I&#8217;ve found that creating special workshop organized by development project could foster our beloved distribution.</p>
<p>oSC is the unique case in the year, where Geekos from all around the world meet together.<br />
Let&#8217;s imagine you, meeting perhaps for the first time your fellows, having nice discussions, and hacking around the software you maintain.<br />
There&#8217;s high level of chance to meet also your end users, and have constructive exchanges.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I invite you to propose a workshop directly to our event tools:<br />
<a href="https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15/proposal" target="_blank">https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15/proposal</a></p>
<p>Having a workshop run like a mini-hack sprint, would help any of us in the distribution and the project.<br />
Be it like learn people how to submit nice package, how to do maintenance, or how to do bug triage.<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/li1.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/li1.png" alt="li1" width="248" height="287" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11197" /></a><br />
I feel confident that you will have the creative approach to resolve your own problematic.<br />
The event place has small rooms for unattended sessions and they could be used to extend your workshop to get some more work done.</p>
<p>Some practical aspects:<br />
oSC website : <a href="https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC15" target="_blank">https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC15</a></p>
<p>And soon the travel support program for oSC 15 will be opened to handle your request about getting financial support for going to oSC.<br />
<a href="https://connect.opensuse.org/travel-support/" target="_blank">https://connect.opensuse.org/travel-support/</a></p>
<p>If you have any questions, thoughts or ideas, don&#8217;t hesitate to ask on -project mailing list<br />
or ping me by reply.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/li3.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/li3.png" alt="" width="191" height="280" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11199" /></a>A final note about the why you should do it? Well beside being one of our &#8220;heroes&#8221; even if nobody need them <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
You and your co-maintainers will be able to explain your &#8220;job&#8221; on the project.<br />
Don&#8217;t you want to inspire new comers, lead them directly to the right direction, and share the load.<br />
Meeting you there, will also help our &#8220;marketing&#8221; force to light up a bit the work done in the shadow.</p>
<p>I really will appreciate your presence, afterwards, it&#8217;s you that create our distribution.<br />
The time has come for you to be warmly thank.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to see you there.</p>
