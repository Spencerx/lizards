				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought it might be nice after the holidays to tell about the status of the <a href="http://kraft.sf.net">Kraft project</a>, the <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> software for people operating a small business. Some nice things happened around it.<br />
<img align="left" src="http://kraft.sourceforge.net/pics/head_logo.gif" alt="Kraft Logo" /></p>
<p>The best thing is that an additional developer works on Kraft: After my last status post <em>Thomas Richard</em> (account trichard) contacted me that he is interested, next days I had the first patch in my mailbox and from that point of time on he constantly contributed high quality changes into the Kraft repository. </p>
<p>His high energy, dedication and fresh ideas gave me a new motivation push after having worked on Kraft basically alone for more than four years. That&#8217;s great!</p>
<p>The last months we worked on porting Kraft to the KDE4 platform which is in a quite good shape in SVN already: Kraft compiles without warnings and without Q3 and K3 support classes and works stable again.</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t resist to make use of the new capabilities of KDE4 here and there and as a result we have a few small feature updates as well. The most interesting might be that the first KDE4 Kraft version will additionally support a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">sqlite</a> database backend which eases setup and configuration for users tremendously.</p>
<p>Following our friends from the <a href="http://kmymoney2.sourceforge.net/index-home.html">KMyMoney</a> project we will come up with a first Kraft-on-KDE4 beta soon. Please stay tuned.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Boosters_Team">boosters team</a> promised to talk about what happens in our sprints &#8211; the two week time boxes in which we work on our <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Boosters_Team/Projects">projects</a>. The last sprint ended on october 27th and we still owe you what happened.</p>
<p>Please understand this little report as usual as an invitation to ask, comment, suggest things and of course fire up your editor and contribute if you like.<br />
You find us on IRC in channel #opensuse-boosters or on the opensuse-boosters mailinglist.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Boosters_Team/Projects/Discoverable_centralised_documentation">Discoverable centralised documentation</a></b> driven by Lubos, Egbert, Henne, Petr and Federico.<br />
This squad is working to provide a better discoverable developer documentation around openSUSE.</p>
<p>In the last sprint a lot of discovering &#8220;how things are usally done with wediawiki&#8221; has happened, such as how wiki content<br />
is sorted or how portals are used. That went in parallel to the discussion Rupert started on the wiki mailinglist, good enough that both efforts go combined now &#8211; everybody is asked to join the discussion on the wiki list.</p>
<p>We also discovered that the media wiki update has not yet gone through, the problem was that our iChain plugin was broken with the new version of the Wiki. The squad will fix that. </p>
<p><b><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Boosters_Team/Projects/Integrate_all_Infrastructure_under_one_Umbrella">Integrate all infrastructure under one Umbrella</a></b> driven by Klaas, Robert, Darix, Michal, Pavol.</p>
<p>We were still very much individually sitting around and fiddle with the Ruby on Rails framework to get on speed with it. For example the way how to integrate several Rails projects under one umbrella project was investigated.</p>
<p>The plan for the next sprint is to come to a first draft on how the new web structure should look like. We&#8217;re very much bound to our artists work, so if you are a screen designer, please get in touch with Robert to support him to direct the poor developer souls.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Boosters_Team/Projects/FactoryStatus">factory.opensuse.org &#8211; website visualising Factory status</a></b> driven by Tom, Vincent, Will, Coolo</p>
<p>this squad was a bit understrength because of vacation and the upcomming 11.2.</p>
<p>Nevertheless they discovered a lot of dependencies in the OBS which are needed to set up the factory.o.o page. Some not so nice corners in the OBS were cleaned a bit which came to light when tom and Will were working to set up a test instance of the OBS.</p>
