				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week kolab became one small step closer to realize feature request  <a href="https://features.opensuse.org/307846">307846: include Kolab in openSUSE</a>.  Although it will take lots and lots of more work to achieve this goal at all.  The one step closer was realized in cooperation with the openSUSE cyrus-imapd maintainer R.  The openSUSE cyrus-imapd spec file in the <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/mail/openSUSE_11.1/i586/">repository server:mail</a> spec file has been extended with information about kolab, but the actual execution of the information has been switched off.  With the Build Service <strong>link</strong> functionality the package server:mail/cyrus-imapd has been linked to the package <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/Kolab:/UNSTABLE/">server:kolab:UNSTABLE/cyrus-imapd-kolab</a>, where the kolab functionality gets built.  This is achieved by activating the variable <strong>with_kolab</strong> in the project related configuration file:<br />
<code># osc meta prjconf server:Kolab:UNSTABLE<br />
%define with_kolab 1<br />
Macros:<br />
%with_kolab 1<br />
</code><br />
See the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service/prjconf#Macros">Build_Service prjconf page</a> in the openSUSE wiki for more information about this awesome functionality.  This way the cyrus-imapd-kolab package inherits everything from the openSUSE base cyrus-imapd package.</p>
<p>One drawback for kolab administrators, you have to manually correct the currently installed kolab packages.  Start with downgrading cyrus-imapd-kolab (it only downgrades the Build service version and not cyrus-imapd itself):<br />
<code># zyp in cyrus-imapd-kolab</code><br />
This will install the dependent package perl-Cyrus-IMAP-kolab instead of perl-Cyrus-IMAP and perl-Cyrus-SIEVE-managesieve-kolab instead of perl-Cyrus-SIEVE-managesieve and it might remove kolab and perl-kolab. </p>
<p>Now reinstall kolab with:<br />
<code># zyp in kolab</code><br />
that should be sufficient to be in sync with the repository again.  Don&#8217;t forget to restart the services, with:<br />
<code># rckolab restart</code></p>
<p>This week also showed the power of the <a href="http://build.opensuse.org">build service</a>, as I could install kolab within only some minutes after installing openSUSE-11.2 in Virtualbox, while I never installed openSUSE-11.2 before.</p>
<p>The kolab installation in openSUS-11.2 made some problems visible in <strong>kolabconf -n</strong>.  The latter has been fixed, it was a general problem in kolabconf and did not have anything to do with openSUSE-11.2.</p>
<p>The kolabconf problem however required some debugging, with a resulted spin off that the spamassassin daemon <strong>spamd</strong> is no longer activated via the startup scripts, but as a library of amavisd instead.  That is the way amavisd and spamd have been configured in kolab, but what was not honored in the kolab setup on openSUSE.</p>
<p>Due to the change in the amavisd and spamd deamons, the script <strong>kolabsrv</strong> has been extended, and can now show a list with services required by kolab and what their current status is (see screenshot):</p>
<div id="attachment_2701" style="width: 507px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/kolabsrv1.png" alt="kolabsrv list and status output" width="497" height="284" class="size-full wp-image-2701" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/kolabsrv1.png 497w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/kolabsrv1-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">kolabsrv list and status output</p></div>
<p>The main task of <strong>kolabsrv</strong> is to convert the openpkg service names to the distribution dependent names.</p>
<p>The kolab project is heading towards a <a href="http://www.kolab.org/roadmap.html">new release 2.2.3</a> with a planned release date in December 2009.</p>
<p>Sascha released a nice <a href="http://kolab.org/pipermail/kolab-devel/2009-November/010984.html">Brain Dump of the Week</a>, giving a nice insight in the possible future of Kolab.</p>
<p>In one of the replies of Sasha&#8217;s brain dump, a references was made to <a href="http://trac.project-builder.org/">project-builder</a>, a project similar to the openSUSE build service.  Although the OBS and project-builder may be similar, some people are wondering what the <a href="http://trac.project-builder.org/wiki/FAQ#Howdoesproject-buildercomparetoOpenSuSEBuildServiceOBS">differences (1)</a> and <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-buildservice/2009-11/msg00295.html">(2)</a> are.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s quite a lot of information, but lots of things happened since my <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2009/10/18/kolab-becomes-available-again-for-opensuse/">last blog entry about Kolab</a>.</p>
<p>PS: many thanks that M. from Novell, who made my Lizards blog account working again.  For the most part of this week, I&#8217;ve not been able to login to my blog account.  After logging in with the correct credentials, I was referred back to the <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org">Lizards entry page</a>.  M. knows the details, so if this happens to you contact M. from Novell <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
