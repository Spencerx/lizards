				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is some work going on to put installation source creation functionality into <strong>kiwi</strong>.<br />
At the moment kiwi can use prepared installation sources such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>BuildService Repositories</li>
<li>mounted DVDs</li>
<li>FTP trees</li>
</ul>
<p>But what if you have a local Build Service building some binary only packages and you wish tp make a installable media set from, say, &#8220;SLES + binary only drivers&#8221;?<br />
You can use the inter-BS-Connectivity feature to only build the drivers (and not the whole distribution) in your BS and then create an installation source from your main BS project.</p>
<p>This is possible since release of the package <strong>kiwi-instsource</strong> which extends the functionality of the <em>config.xml</em>file to allow the compilation of an installation source from scratch.<br />
Hereby &#8220;scratch&#8221; means directories containing <em>.rpm</em> and <em>.spm</em> files. Of course some information must be provided for the metadata creation &#8212; but this is also all in the config file (with one known exception &#8212; the PDB data).</p>
<p>The rest is figuring out which packages must be on the installation source.<br />
Since it is perfectly ok to have conflicting packages in instsources, there is no dependency check or package resolving in this stage. The information must come from the user.</p>
<p>Therefore the package list may become rather long and I already plan to implement some simplification.<br />
These plans include:</p>
<ul>
<li>allowing more than one &lt;repopackages&gt; section</li>
<li>implement outsourcing blocks in separate files using XML functionality</li>
</ul>
