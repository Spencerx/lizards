				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have these working openSUSE Factory images for the Raspberry Pi, which is an ARM-based mini-computer, and since I want to encourage my kid to do more with computers than playing games (even if they are open-source), I looked into how GPIOs worked.<br />
For that, you need to find the pin allocation &#8211; e.g.<br />
in <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#General_Purpose_Input.2FOutput_.28GPIO.29">the elinux GPIO description</a> or<br />
<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1417">http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1417</a><br />
has a video which has it explained at 03:00</p>
<p>For my test, I wired together pin11 and pin12, which are GPIO17 and GPIO18.<br />
I wanted GPIO17 to receive what is sent by GPIO18.<br />
This is how this looked for me: <img src="http://www.zq1.de/~bernhard/images/arm/Raspberry-gpio1718.jpg" alt="foto of GPIO17 and 18 wired together" /></p>
<p>Using it directly from the shell is simple:<br />
<code>echo 17 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export<br />
echo 18 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export<br />
echo out &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio18/direction<br />
echo 1 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio18/value<br />
watch -n 1 head /sys/class/gpio/gpio*/value<br />
</code></p>
<p>If the wiring and configuration was right, the &#8220;watch&#8221; will show gpio17/value to become 1 too.<br />
You can then also pull the wire (or insert a physical switch) and see gpio17/value dropping to 0 again, when it is no more receiving the current from the other pin.</p>
<p>If you managed to get this working, you reached level one of hardware-hackery.</p>
