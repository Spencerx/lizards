				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the help of a unique identifier that is stored in every binary executable matching the executable, a coredump and the corresponding debuginfo together becomes really easy. You don&#8217;t need to know the package name and the version-release string to download and install the correct debuginfo package. This is achieved by extending the linker, some additional tools and the package management itself.</p>
<p><span id="more-816"></span></p>
<p>The build id is a unique identifier stored in the <em>.note.gnu.build-id</em> note section of the executable file and loaded into the process image during run-time. Different means to compute the unique identifier are supported although the default setting is to use a 20 byte SHA1 hash of the unstripped executable (see ld linker documentation for further information about the <em>&#8211;build-id</em> option).</p>
<p>To be able to read the build id from a core dump the kernel must include the ELF header pages in file-backed private memory areas (see documentation on <em>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/coredump_filter</em>). This is the default setting on recent openSUSE kernel versions.</p>
<p>Different tools can be used to print out the build-id. <em>eu-readelf</em> (from the elfutils package) prints the contents of the note sections given the <em>-n</em> option in a human readable fashion. <em>pbuildid</em> (from the ptools package) is prints the build-id from executables and from core files including the build-id of all loaded shared objects during the crash.</p>
<p>Now, zypper can be asked to install the debuginfo package that provides the debuginfo for the given build-id.</p>
<pre>
# zypper install -C "debuginfo(build-id)=b75bab63c9a25eb13264bb95f1fef190e157f865"
