				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a friendly reminder for all who haven&#8217;t send their talk proposals for the <a title="openSUSE Conference" href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference" target="_blank">openSUSE Conference 2010</a> yet. The <a title="Call for Papers" href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_call_for_papers" target="_blank">Call for Papers</a> closes end of july and there are still slots available.</p>
<p>The second openSUSE conference takes place in Nuremberg, Germany from october, 20th to 23rd. After its great start last year, we will continue the concept of a user and developer conference around the openSUSE Project including talks, workshops and BOFs. Expect everything between technical workshops about bleeding edge linux distro technology over user presentations about software to inspiring discussions with other projects, especially since the motto for the conference is <em>Collaboration across Borders</em>.</p>
<p>The first conference has also shown how important the openSUSE Conference is for the steering of the openSUSE project. Lots of ideas could be discussed and implemented quickly but also difficult or controversal  community internal topics came up in a very contructive way and are worked on since then, some until today.</p>
<p>That brings me to the core message of this post: <strong>You</strong> should be on the conference if you are interested in the openSUSE project in any way. If you want to help moving the project forward and influence where the journey is going, there is no better place to go.</p>
<p>Now is the time to shape the conference &#8211; be it with a talk proposal, a proposal for a workshop, some hack session or interact with other projects to make you project a half day track or so. Everything is possible, please approach the <a href="mailto:cfp@opensuse.org">programm committee</a> with your ideas!</p>
