				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have used a cloud, that was based on OpenStack, you will have seen the dashboard including a web-based VNC access using noVNC + WebSockets.<br />
However, it was not possible to access this VNC directly (e.g. with my favourite gvncviewer from the gtk-vnc-tools package), because the actual compute nodes are hidden and accessing them would circumvent authentication, too.</p>
<p>I want this for the option to add an OpenStack-backend to openQA, my OS-autotesting framework, which emulates a user by using a few primitives: grabbing screenshots and typing keys (can be done through VNC), powering up a machine(=nova boot), inserting/ejecting an installation medium (=nova volume-attach / volume-detach).</p>
<p>To allow for this, I wrote a small perl script, that translates a TCP-connection into a WebSocket-connection.<br />
It is installed like this<br />
<code>git clone https://github.com/bmwiedemann/connectionproxy.git<br />
sudo /sbin/OneClickInstallUI http://multiymp.zq1.de/perl-Protocol-WebSocket?base=http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:languages:perl</code></p>
<p>and is used like this<br />
<code>nova get-vnc-console $YOURINSTANCE novnc<br />
perl wsconnectionproxy.pl --port 5942 --to http://cloud.example.com:6080/vnc_auto.html?token=73a3e035-cc28-49b4-9013-a9692671788e<br />
gvncviewer localhost:42</code></p>
<p>I hope this neat code will be useful for other people and tasks as well and wish you a lot of fun with it.</p>
<p>Some technical details:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is able to handle multiple connections in a single thread using select.</li>
<li>HTTPS is not supported in the code, but likely could be done with stunnel.</li>
<li>WebSocket-code was written in 3h.</li>
<li>noVNC tokens expire after a few minutes.</li>
</ul>
