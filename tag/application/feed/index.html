				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Its Hackweek number six at SUSE as you might have heard. Hackweek is great as employees are encouraged to work on a free software project they want. I work on my project <a href="http://volle-kraft-voraus.de">Kraft</a> and really appreciate the time that I can spend on it.</p>
<p>What I intend to do can be summarized with <strong>Share your Kraft</strong>. Up to now, Kraft is working fine for a single user. But what if a team wants to use Kraft and share number cycles (which are base for the document numbering like invoice number), documents and template catalogs? Well, as long as they share the same database, it might work (I didn&#8217;t test deeply) but if they happen to be on different locations it becomes difficult. I try to make that possible.</p>
<p>My development target for Kraft is simplicity. For the user of course, but also for the setup. The server to share data, which is obviously needed, must work on a cheap hosting offer, and it must work with a weak internet line. So a database connect via internet is not possible. </p>
<p>I decided to investigate in <a href="http://owncloud.org">ownCloud</a> and enhance it with a plug-in called <strong>KitoC</strong>. ownCloud is a project started by Frank Karlitschek and implements a handy but scalable WebDAV Server beside more. Seems to fit my needs perfectly. Yesterday I implemented the number server function in KitoC after good conversation with Cornelius at breakfast in the office. Not very much achieved yet, but had to learn a bit of ownCloud first. I keep you posted.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently people played around a lot with a new kind of presentations. The pages in the classical presentation tool sense seem to lie around on a large canvas and while the presentation running, the focus moves over the canvas and stops by interesting points. Zooming allows to go more in detail and other cool graphics effects make it fun to watch these presentations.</p>
<p>This week was the <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/05/28/novell-hackweek-fife/">fifth Hackweek</a> at Novell where we can pick an interesting topic and work on it. I am always interested in cool applications and I wanted to investigate a bit on Qts GraphicsView anyway so I decided to go for a proof of concept implementation of a lightweight but cool presentation tool following these concepts.</p>
<p>The tool is called Zippl (for no specific reason). It is implemented in C++ with Qt 4.6. Via a XML file the user can specify so called spots on the Zippl-canvas. During a presentation one after the other canvas is displayed with an animated move from one to the other.</p>
<p>Spots can consist of text in various fonts and sizes, geometric forms and images. Colors and line widths and stuff can be specified for each item. It is amazing what can already be done with these few elements.</p>
<p>But decide yourself by checking the following out, its the first little presentation done with Zippl:</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/0FMAGDO9ecc&#038;hl=de&#038;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/0FMAGDO9ecc&#038;hl=de&#038;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object> </p>
<p>With Qt its again fun to work on this kind of applications and the GraphicsView framework is awesome. If you want to see code, it is in the KDE svn, module playground/office.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is that something to investigate more on? You can give me feedback in <a href="https://features.opensuse.org/309584">openFATE</a> about it if you want and rate it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought it might be nice after the holidays to tell about the status of the <a href="http://kraft.sf.net">Kraft project</a>, the <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> software for people operating a small business. Some nice things happened around it.<br />
<img align="left" src="http://kraft.sourceforge.net/pics/head_logo.gif" alt="Kraft Logo" /></p>
<p>The best thing is that an additional developer works on Kraft: After my last status post <em>Thomas Richard</em> (account trichard) contacted me that he is interested, next days I had the first patch in my mailbox and from that point of time on he constantly contributed high quality changes into the Kraft repository. </p>
<p>His high energy, dedication and fresh ideas gave me a new motivation push after having worked on Kraft basically alone for more than four years. That&#8217;s great!</p>
<p>The last months we worked on porting Kraft to the KDE4 platform which is in a quite good shape in SVN already: Kraft compiles without warnings and without Q3 and K3 support classes and works stable again.</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t resist to make use of the new capabilities of KDE4 here and there and as a result we have a few small feature updates as well. The most interesting might be that the first KDE4 Kraft version will additionally support a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">sqlite</a> database backend which eases setup and configuration for users tremendously.</p>
<p>Following our friends from the <a href="http://kmymoney2.sourceforge.net/index-home.html">KMyMoney</a> project we will come up with a first Kraft-on-KDE4 beta soon. Please stay tuned.</p>
