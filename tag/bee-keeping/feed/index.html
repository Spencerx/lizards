				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quite off topic, but for those of you who are interested in bee keeping as I am I  for once like to share a video that  we  were able to create on a sunny sunday morning recently:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">

<p>It shows the activity of catching a bee swarm that has been going out of the bee hive before. Swarming is natural behaviour of bees for reproduction. In early summer the bees create a new queen and as it  is emerging, the old queen is swarming out of the hive looking for a new home. One form of the old and meaningful circle of reproduction.</p>
<p>A bee swarm is a very impressive event, the clip might give you an impression. And as our seven year old son was brave enough to take this movie, I thought it is worth sharing. Bee keeping is a family virus  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
