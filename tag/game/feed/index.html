				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago I was wandering on the <a href="http://forums.opensuse.org" target="_blank">openSUSE Forums</a>, once more in the games section when I saw one more post from one of our users asking for <a href="http://www.unknown-horizons.org" target="_blank">Unknown Horizons</a>&#8230; I&#8217;ve search a bit and found 2 entries on OBS (<a href="http://build.opensuse.org" target="_blank">openSUSE Build Service</a>), one for Fedora packages and another for openSUSE packages.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve joined #unknown-horizons on <a href="irc://irc.opensuse.org">FreeNode</a> and found out that Unknown Horizons is very active and people are very nice. I&#8217;ve made a few questions around and offered myself to package this nice game for openSUSE (home:ketheriel:UnknownHorizons). Some of the dependencies are provided by the games repository, to which I want to submit the major releases, and if possible enable builds for Fedora (and friends).</p>
<p>A few packages need some tweaks to enable builds for Fedora (allegro, libenet, guichan), and I&#8217;m working already on that. Meanwhile for everyone who wants to check out the latest development snapshot of Unknown Horizons, feel free to do so&#8230; Currently packaged for:</p>
<p>* openSUSE 11.3<br />
* openSUSE 11.4<br />
* openSUSE Factory<br />
* openSUSE Tumbleweed</p>
<p>The 1-Click installer can be found on <a href="http://www.unknown-horizons.org/download/linux/" target="_blank">Unknown Horizons download page</a>. Â There&#8217;s also a nice article (bumping ego) about the new openSUSE packages on Unknown Horizons webpage!</p>
<p>This is a title that all openSUSE users who like RTS games should try (supports openGL and sdl) and is powered by the <a href="http://www.fifengine.de" target="_blank">FIFE Engine</a>.</p>
