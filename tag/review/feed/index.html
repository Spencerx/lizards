				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>openSUSE 11.0 Beta 3 already available on factory repos since May 15 2008 (in Indonesia, GMT+7) and <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2008/05/16/announcing-opensuse-110-beta-3/">has announced</a> on May 16, 2008, but I can&#8217;t directly tried it because one of my programmer staff has resigned last week, so, I must covering up his work for a while and I can&#8217;t go for an install fest <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . I&#8217;ve finished downloading the iso-both kde live and the i386 dvd iso-on Friday, with standard downloading from mirror on <a href="http://ftp5.gwdg.de/pub/opensuse/distribution/11.0-Beta3/">ftp5.gwdg.de</a>.</p>
<p>I tried  beta 3 on Satuday, and having a problem while  running  KDE LiveCD. The LiveCD failed run with an error exception : <em>&#8220;Failed mounting Read Only File System&#8221;</em>. I think it was a problem with my testing computer, so I take another machine which ended with same result.</p>
<p>I think I would like to post the error on mailing list but I decided to wait an installation testing with DVD iso. on Beta 1 I&#8217;ve an issue with LiveCD installation but the DVD iso is worked without problem, so I think it would rather LiveCD problem than beta 3 problem in general.</p>
<p><span id="more-23"></span>In Satuday evening I tried KDE Live on VMWare environment before playing with the DVD iso. Surprised, it was worked flawlessly, running well without problem including Live installation. I don&#8217;t know why the LiveCD worked without problem on VMWare workstation but having problem on physical machine. I assumes that it would like the problem with the iso burned on CD, not with iso itself, so I take another blank disc and burned the kde live iso once again.</p>
<p>The second burned kde live iso worked without problem too, so the conclusion is the problem with the quality of the first burned CD <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="&#x1f641;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.vavai.com/uploads/beta3-1.jpeg"><img src="http://www.vavai.com/uploads/beta3-1-kecil.jpeg" alt="beta3-1" /></a></p>
<p>Today, I give the beta 3 testing on my testing PC at work. As noticed by <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2007/08/09/people-of-opensuse-stephan-kulow/">Coolo</a> in beta 3 announcement, the live installation running well without problem. I most likely using live installation than the DVD install because the live install is more faster and just need a few question (used default setting). The different approach between DVD install and live install is about the flexibility of installation setting. The live install produce more faster because it&#8217;s used the default setting, with standard option.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vavai.com/uploads/beta3-4.jpeg"><img src="http://www.vavai.com/uploads/beta3-4-kecil.jpeg" alt="Beta 3 KDE 4 Desktop" width="350" height="263" /></a></p>
<p>Anyway, Here is a short of summary of beta 3 from my own perspective :</p>
<ol>
<li>LiveCD is much better than previous one and looks pretty stable for production used. As mentioned on the announcement, it&#8217;s not recommended for production use but if you like it, you can used with your own risk <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="&#x1f61b;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . I used beta 3 on my personal laptop and openSUSE 10.3 with KDE 4 on my work computer</li>
<li>Beta 3 better polished than 10.3 but the polished not really complete. I like the login interface although in my personal mind, <a href="http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Image:2008.1_kde_kdm.jpg">Mandriva 2008.1 login form</a> is better polished <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . The polished interface not only in login form but also in installation setting and some application, ie : on OpenOffice. I think the polished Open Office splash screen need an update and some artwork. Black splash screen with a small bird is less nicer than Open Office splash screen on 10.2 <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="&#x1f600;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>Beta 3 come with KDE 4.0.4, Firefox 3 beta 5, Open Office 2.4.0.10 and some of updated component. Everything seems to worked without problem. I&#8217;m experienced with KDE4 problem on shut down process (crash of plasma) but I think it&#8217;s the problem with KDE 4 because I got same error with KDE 4 on openSUSE 10.3</li>
<li>Zypper package manager is much faster and has becoming my default package manager. With delta-rpm support and increasing speed capability, I&#8217;m quite satisfied with zypper and personally encourage for  Indonesian openSUSE lover in <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2008/05/15/indonesian-opensuse-community-monthly-meeting-on-detikcom/">next meeting</a>.</li>
<li>Beta 3 successfully detected my graphical driver although it come with 800X600 default setting, but hey, I could used KRandR to change the setting into 1024X768 without confused problem : <em>&#8220;Your X server is   using the RandR extension at version 1.2 or greater which doesn&#8217;t have   any configuration yet&#8221;</em> as shown in 10.3 <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>The big problem with beta 3 is about ath5k wireless driver. It was successfully detected my Atheros AR5212 (D-Link Wireless Card) but I could not connect to my Access Point with KNetworkManager or standard ifup. I can bring it up after disabling ath5k driver and used standard madwifi driver (madwifi.tar.gz version 0.9.4, with make, make install and modprobe ath_pci. Installation how-to in Bahasa Indonesia, <a href="http://www.vavai.com/index.php?/archives/96-Instalasi-Wireless-LAN-Atheros-AR5212-pada-OpenSUSE.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.vavai.com/blog/index.php?/archives/676-Wireless-LAN-Chipset-Atheros-dengan-Driver-Madwifi-pada-OpenSUSE.html">here</a>). I have same problem with Beta 1 and Beta 2</li>
<li>Wireless LAN Network Manager come with the auto detect hotspot without any &#8220;scan&#8221; button or something like that. I would personally encourage to add the button to make sure that we can refresh the hotspot list rather than waiting for nothing scanned <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ol>

<p>With all of nice feature on openSUSE 11.0 beta 3, we hope 11.0 will be released on June 19 2008 with bunch of nice features.</p>
