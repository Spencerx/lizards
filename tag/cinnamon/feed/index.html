				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">I was Inspired by the time  in a remote area, which is absolutely no internet connection, but I have problem when trying to share the DVD installer openSUSE 12.1 to Students and teachers at the vocational school, because the default openSUSE 12.1  distribution does not include Audio &amp; Video codec, the issue of License GPL (General Public License) that embraced by the openSUSE distro. I try to make openSUSE Multimedia is ready for use by the user without having to depend on internet connection because they have to install Codecs Audio &amp; Video.<br />
Nothing is different the official openSUSE 12.1 with openSUSE Multimedia, I just added some applications that do not exist in the original distribution of openSUSE and add <a href="http://opensuse-community.org/Restricted_formats" target="_blank">Restricted_formats</a>  codec, in addition to applications and libraries that were included are up to date of http://download.opensuse.org/update/12.1/.</p>
<p>openSUSE 12.1 Multimedia 32-bit Base on openSUSE  12.1, using the default desktop  Gnome  3 sprinkled with cinnamon.<br />
openSUSE 12.1 Multimedia  built using susestudio.com, and are designed to be ready to use for users who want to feel the openSUSE but trouble Internet connection, because they have to install codecs mp3, mp4, wmv and some other restricted format http://opensuse-community.org/Restricted_formats.</p>
<p>As for some of the packages included in it are:</p>
<p>A. LibreOffice<br />
2. banshe<br />
3. Amarok<br />
4. Brasero<br />
5. Cheese<br />
6. Empathy<br />
7. Xchat<br />
8. flash-player<br />
9. Gmplayer<br />
10.Gimp<br />
11.Imagewriter<br />
12.k3b<br />
13.Smplayer<br />
14.etc &#8230;</p>
<p>If you want to use it please download via http://susestudio.com/a/haHwG8/opensuse-multimedia</p>
