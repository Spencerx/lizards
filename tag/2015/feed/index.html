				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Geekos, here a small summary of our Thursday February 19th openSUSE miniSummit event here at SCale 13x.</p>
<p>Located in Century AB room, a 80 seats room. The average attendance rate was varying between 50% and 85%.<br />
Qualifying the attendance 50% or more were not related to SUSE / openSUSE, which was a good experience of question and feedback.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_3087.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_3087-300x200.jpg" alt="openSUSE miniSummit T-shirt" width="300" height="200" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11288" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_3087-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_3087-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The day started by a talk about openSUSE / SUSE Xen and openstack by Peter Linnel and Russel Pavlicek.<br />
One hour later Manu Gupta has presented all the bolts and nuts about GSOC at openSUSE.</p>
<p>We then go for lunch, and corridor exchanges.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve opened the afternoon with my talk &#8220;them + me = we&#8221; about breaking mythic frontier<br />
Then just after a small break, Mark Fasheh member of filesystem SUSE Labs group has talk about the project Duperemove: dedupe on btrfs (have a look on github the source are there, and package available on obs)</p>
<p>The day continue with a Town Hall talk co-animated by myself and Peter running an open discussion with attendees. With interesting remarks and feedback from openSUSE users, and also complete foreigners. For example, the way systemd was introduced in openSUSE distribution was appreciated (having choice during 2 versions). It was an unstressfull, open and positive exchange.  </p>
<p>To follow, Bryan Lunduke and Peter animated a talk about &#8220;the 10 things you would love about SUSE and openSUSE if you only you knew&#8230;&#8221;<br />
I did really enjoy the way they numbered the slides &#8230;<br />
Freschy, punchy, funky, the kinda talk I would like to see again at OSC15.</p>
<p>To finalize the day, Markus Feilner​ for Linux Magazine (de) talked about openQA.</p>
<p>I found interesting the perfect mix we&#8217;ve done between openSUSE and SUSE during this day, confirming the excellent partnership we have.<br />
Let the sponsors of this day be warmly thanked to make it happened.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m contacting you personally, as an openSUSE Board member.</p>
<p>You certainly already know that we want to have a kicking openSUSE conference next 1st-4th May 2015 at the Haag (NL).</p>
<p>Thus I&#8217;ve found that creating special workshop organized by development project could foster our beloved distribution.</p>
<p>oSC is the unique case in the year, where Geekos from all around the world meet together.<br />
Let&#8217;s imagine you, meeting perhaps for the first time your fellows, having nice discussions, and hacking around the software you maintain.<br />
There&#8217;s high level of chance to meet also your end users, and have constructive exchanges.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I invite you to propose a workshop directly to our event tools:<br />
<a href="https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15/proposal" target="_blank">https://events.opensuse.org/conference/osc15/proposal</a></p>
<p>Having a workshop run like a mini-hack sprint, would help any of us in the distribution and the project.<br />
Be it like learn people how to submit nice package, how to do maintenance, or how to do bug triage.<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/li1.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/li1.png" alt="li1" width="248" height="287" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11197" /></a><br />
I feel confident that you will have the creative approach to resolve your own problematic.<br />
The event place has small rooms for unattended sessions and they could be used to extend your workshop to get some more work done.</p>
<p>Some practical aspects:<br />
oSC website : <a href="https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC15" target="_blank">https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC15</a></p>
<p>And soon the travel support program for oSC 15 will be opened to handle your request about getting financial support for going to oSC.<br />
<a href="https://connect.opensuse.org/travel-support/" target="_blank">https://connect.opensuse.org/travel-support/</a></p>
<p>If you have any questions, thoughts or ideas, don&#8217;t hesitate to ask on -project mailing list<br />
or ping me by reply.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/li3.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/li3.png" alt="" width="191" height="280" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11199" /></a>A final note about the why you should do it? Well beside being one of our &#8220;heroes&#8221; even if nobody need them <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
You and your co-maintainers will be able to explain your &#8220;job&#8221; on the project.<br />
Don&#8217;t you want to inspire new comers, lead them directly to the right direction, and share the load.<br />
Meeting you there, will also help our &#8220;marketing&#8221; force to light up a bit the work done in the shadow.</p>
<p>I really will appreciate your presence, afterwards, it&#8217;s you that create our distribution.<br />
The time has come for you to be warmly thank.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to see you there.</p>

<p>FOSDEM offers open source developers a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Renowned for being highly developer-oriented, the event brings together some 5000+ geeks from all over the world.</p>
<p>The fifteenth edition will take place on Saturday 31 January and Sunday 1 February 2015 at the usual location: ULB Campus Solbosch in Brussels.</p>
<p>We now invite proposals for main track presentations and developer rooms.</p>
<p>Previous editions have featured tracks centered around security, operating system development, community building, and many other topics. Presentations are expected to be 50 minutes long and should cater to a varied technical audience. The conference covers travel expenses and arranges accommodation for accepted main track speakers.</p>
<p>Developer rooms are assigned to self-organizing groups to work together on open source projects, to discuss topics relevant to a broader subset of the community, etc. Content may be scheduled in any format, subject to approval. Popular formats include presentation tracks, hacking sessions and panel discussions. Proposals involving collaboration across project or domain boundaries are strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>Proposals for main track presentations should be submitted using Pentabarf:</p>
<p><a href="https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/">https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/</a></p>
<p>Developer room proposals should be emailed to devrooms@fosdem.org and be as detailed as possible. In particular, coordinators should indicate their affinity with the topic being proposed and provide a rough idea of the content they plan to schedule.</p>
<p>Key dates:</p>
<p>15 September<br />
deadline for developer room proposals</p>
<p>1 October<br />
deadline for main track proposals<br />
accepted developer rooms announced</p>
