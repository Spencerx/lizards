<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12271807465_4eb0674948_b.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/12271807465_4eb0674948_b-150x150.jpg" alt="fosdem 2014 - full" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10496" style="margin:8px" /></a></p>
<p>Again this year, <a href="https://fosdem.org/">Fosdem</a> was really delightful, a bit crowdy as hell concerning a number of conference rooms.</p>
<p>But if there&#8217;s a constant, it is the awesomeness of the Fosdem staff and its armada of volunteers. Please all of you who made this event so great, receive in the name of openSUSE&#8217;s community our warmest thanks and congratulations.</p>
<p>I will not make a mistake if I predict a big success for the different talk&#8217;s videos, in the next following weeks.</p>
<h2 style="clear:both">openSUSE merchandising new collection</h2>
<p>After a <b>loooong wait</b>, perceived as a century, openSUSE Booth was furbished with the next generation of merchandising stuff.<br />
<br />At least some part of the complete kit, which should be available in April.</p>
<p><span id="more-10494"></span></p>
<h3>The new design &amp; branding ideas</h3>
<p>This was the first public showing of the new posters &amp; goodies design. The basis of the design appear first during HackWeek&#8217;10<br />
<img src="https://hackweek.suse.com/assets/hackweek-logo-10-2dbf37934f48409e969e0339f472bab4.png" style="background:#c4c4c4;margin: 10px;padding: 10px;width:50%;height:50%" /><br />
<br />this Geeko&#8217;s was put on pullover <i>I&#8217;m still looking where I can grab one, so take care of yours if you own one <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></i></p>
<h3>Posters</h3>
<p>We got three kind of new posters, and one block-note. I would like to thanks booth&#8217;s helpers for spreading them on almost any Fosdem&#8217;s building free walls.</p>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-discover-it.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-discover-it-213x300.jpg" alt="2014-discover-it" width="213" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10499" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-discover-it-213x300.jpg 213w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-discover-it.jpg 344w" sizes="(max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px" /></a></p>
<h4>Discover it &#8211; Bulb A2</h4>
<p>With elegant dark green and white symbol on big format, it won the heart’s public.<br />
Several of them were offered.
</p>
</div>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em;clear:both"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-block-note.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-block-note-198x300.jpg" alt="2014-A3-block-note" width="198" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10497" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-block-note-198x300.jpg 198w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-block-note.jpg 341w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /></a></p>
<h4>Block-note meeting or communication papers A3</h4>
<p>
Useful on a booth to pick feedback, announce something in an fashionned way.<br />
I hope we will have the A4 format too.
</p>
</div>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em;clear:both">
<h4>Linux for open minds A3</h4>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-linux-for-openminds.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-linux-for-openminds-209x300.jpg" alt="2014-linux-for-openminds" width="209" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10500" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-linux-for-openminds-209x300.jpg 209w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-linux-for-openminds.jpg 338w" sizes="(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px" /></a></p>
<p>With its light green and zen symbols I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the perfect poster in an office, being not too intrusive.<br />
<br />It found its place on walls around the Fosdem, but on the booth A3 format reduce its attractive effect.<br />
The second default (if it&#8217;s one) project name and logo are small, bottom placed so could escape visitor attention.
</p>
</div>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em;clear:both">
<h4>We believe &#8211; cube way A3</h4>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-we_believe.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-we_believe-200x300.jpg" alt="2014-A3-we_believe" width="200" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10498" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-we_believe-200x300.jpg 200w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-A3-we_believe.jpg 337w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></p>
<p>The &quot;we believe&quot; collection was always my favorite one. But I must admit the format proposed doesn&#8217;t work on booth. It lacks contrast and/or appealing colors.<br />
If you stand at more than 1.5 meters the message (our guidelines) are almost unreadable.<br />
<br />Look like this one need another development iteration.</p>
</div>
<div style="margin:0.05em;padding: 0.1em;clear:both">
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth-300x225.jpg" alt="fosdem-2014-booth" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10502" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h5>Stickers</h5>
<h6>Geeko&#8217;s stickers</h6>
<p>Appreciated and adopted by fans, and the public. The size is perfect. </p>
<p>We still get a number of request to have some with transparent background, which would allow them as perfect decoration for any kind of devices.</p>
<h6>Geeko&#8217;s keyboard patch stickers</h6>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a very limited edition of Geeko&#8217;s keyboard patch stickers. For the first time, you will have pleasure to press the meta key.<br />
They literally create a rush on the booth, we save some to patch our demonstration computer with them.</p>
<p>I predict a long and successful life to this article. I hope future booth box will contain thousand of them.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth2.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth2-278x300.jpg" alt="fosdem-2014-booth2" width="278" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10510" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth2-278x300.jpg 278w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-booth2.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px" /></a></p>
<h5>Table covers</h5>
<p>Done in synthetic material, colored with a beautiful green and proudly displaying the openSUSE logo. They are light resistant flexible.<br />
<br />Excellent article.</p>
<p>As there&#8217;s 2 models, one with big Geeko on top and the other one having openSUSE written on bottom front, they can&#8217;t be use for the same mission.<br />
What impact would have one with the big Geeko sitting on the front with just one openSUSE? We should have some others shoot to be sure to get the best model.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-flag.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-flag-128x300.jpg" alt="fosdem-2014-flag" width="128" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10511" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-flag-128x300.jpg 128w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fosdem-2014-flag.jpg 175w" sizes="(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px" /></a></p>
<h5>Flag (alpha testing)</h5>
<p>We also got a kind of flag, in an alpha-state, we fixed it on top of an official SUSE roll-up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not sure how to use this one. As a stand-up like the open-mind poster, the who&#8217;s behind the message is bottom placed which<br />
is always a bit hidden if placed on a roll-up.<br />
As a flag, the holes are missing to use it on different kind of support.
</p>
<h3>Flyer &amp; brochure</h3>
<p>The cheat sheet encounter a big success, using the other side to present key related tools (obs, openqa, susestudio) allow people on booth to introduce them or talk about it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a number of commands that need to be removed from it (obsolete or deprecated way of doing things)</p>
<p>Flyer, even with the printing default and small shift in the bulb, find their audience.</p>
<h3>openSUSE DVD by Open Press</h3>
<p>We received finally 1400 DVD of the Open Press&#8217;s edition containing Live KDE / Gnome 64 bits. We spread out 1000 of them, 200 were split between Advocates for future events in Austria, Spain and Greece.</p>
<h3>openSUSE conference cube box &amp; penguins</h3>
<p>Those two articles were unfortunately a failure at Fosdem booth. They are over complicated to build, and need too much material (scissors, glue) and too much time (15 minutes pro piece)</p>
<p>They should have been used to advertise the conference, but are not practical, once assembled they took too much place. Same on printed material, A3 is too big for any bags.</p>
<p>Croatian team bring a lot of them to use them locally. If we want to keep those kind of article for booth the printed result should be perforated and you should able to build the object with only your ten fingers in less than a minute.</p>
<h2>Missing parts</h2>
<p>I can&#8217;t be satisfied with what we received, our booth look so poor compared to what we usually present to the public.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget those article can be sold</p>
<ul>
<li>t-shirts : where are our fancy and inspiriting t-shirts?</li>
<li>usb sticks</li>
<li>Pens</li>
<li>Pins</li>
<li>hat</li>
<li>plush : so beloved</li>
<li>Old Toad bottles (*)</li>
</ul>
<p>(*) About our Old Toad beer, I&#8217;ve explained to people that nothing is impossible if and only if the community will assume the responsibility about managing the stock, carrying the boxes, and drink or sell the minimal order in less than 6 months. We&#8217;ll see if a Old Toad Team appear soon.</p>
<h2>Computers</h2>
<p>Just a small remark, our two touchscreen computers (only one has accepted to come at Fosdem) start to show their age.</p>
<h2>First part conclusion</h2>
<p>I will conclude this article which was more oriented on the new marketing stuff. There&#8217;s still quite works to be 100% useful and successful. I will come back soon with another article with some thoughts about how openSUSE booth has worked and details we could improve in the future
</p>
<p>Thanks for your reading, comments &amp; feedback are open!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you feel as an open source developer, user, or enthusiast if you see this beautiful piece of software is used by hundred of schools and thousand of students? Great isn&#8217;t it? And that&#8217;s what happened here in a small dot on this earth in <a title="Yogyakarta Special Region" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta_%28special_region%29" target="_blank">Yogyakarta Indonesia</a>.</p>
<p>This program was initiated by the Government of Indonesia with the objective to introduce the open source and e-learning method to student and teacher. So three years ago I was contacted to help them to realize their dream, and here I&#8217;m now reporting that there are around 7300 openSUSE installation in <a title="openSUSE in schools" href="http://ict-eqep.com/locations/map_350.html" target="_blank">350 elementary and junior-high schools</a>. We also use SLES in servers to provide repositories and e-learning materials in SCORM using Moodle.  This is work in progress. We educate teachers to use openSUSE and also creating learning material so it is always in beta stage I think <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="&#x1f600;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I want to say thank you to all the good people, my friends and co-workers, they are unknown in openSUSE community, even many of them are not subscribing the mailing list, but they are the true openSUSE ambassadors in Indonesia. They come to schools and persuade the teachers to use openSUSE. Without them this dream will never come true. Picture below show some of them smiling holding the openSUSE 12.1 promo DVD that AJ sent to me. You all great! Also picture of teachers while following our session about openSUSE.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yogyakarta is one of the tourism destination in Indonesia. The unique Javanise tradition blend with some acculturation from outside culture. Recently I was asked by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology and Office of Education, Youth and Sport of Yogyakarta to help them to prepare the computer lab for elementary and junior high school in Yogyakarta Province &#8211; Indonesia.</p>
<p>Well, this is the tough job. I work with some expert, teacher and education strategist to prepare the e-learning system. We should prepare learning/teaching material in digital format, train the teacher to use authoring tools and operating system, and prepare the schools to be ready to receive the PC&#8217;s. This government initiative will involve 500 schools in 3 years. Every school that involve in this program will receive 21 PCs.</p>
<p>We select openSUSE Li-f-e as the operating system in every pc. The selection is not because I&#8217;m an openSUSE member but we come to the conclusion that openSUSE Li-f-e is the most complete and well prepare distribution for education  (well, I convince other expert, some of them are Ph.D, he..he&#8230;). This year there are 110 schools involve in this program, this means another new 2310 openSUSE installation and more than 4000 new users if we assume that every PC will be used by 2 students.</p>
<p>Not only give PC to schools we also should connect the schools to the provincial data center. This is really challenging task, some areas of this province is covered by hundred of hills with karst topography and with no terestrial internet connection. Many of the schools is in that area. The road ahead still far away and difficult, but see the face of the children who really enthusiast with the openSUSE make me really happy.</p>
