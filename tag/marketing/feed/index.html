				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do you feel as an open source developer, user, or enthusiast if you see this beautiful piece of software is used by hundred of schools and thousand of students? Great isn&#8217;t it? And that&#8217;s what happened here in a small dot on this earth in <a title="Yogyakarta Special Region" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta_%28special_region%29" target="_blank">Yogyakarta Indonesia</a>.</p>
<p>This program was initiated by the Government of Indonesia with the objective to introduce the open source and e-learning method to student and teacher. So three years ago I was contacted to help them to realize their dream, and here I&#8217;m now reporting that there are around 7300 openSUSE installation in <a title="openSUSE in schools" href="http://ict-eqep.com/locations/map_350.html" target="_blank">350 elementary and junior-high schools</a>. We also use SLES in servers to provide repositories and e-learning materials in SCORM using Moodle.Â  This is work in progress. We educate teachers to use openSUSE and also creating learning material so it is always in beta stage I think <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I want to say thank you to all the good people, my friends and co-workers, they are unknown in openSUSE community, even many of them are not subscribing the mailing list, but they are the true openSUSE ambassadors in Indonesia. They come to schools and persuade the teachers to use openSUSE. Without them this dream will never come true. Picture below show some of them smiling holding the openSUSE 12.1 promo DVD that AJ sent to me. You all great! Also picture of teachers while following our session about openSUSE.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yogyakarta is one of the tourism destination in Indonesia. The unique Javanise tradition blend with some acculturation from outside culture. Recently I was asked by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology and Office of Education, Youth and Sport of Yogyakarta to help them to prepare the computer lab for elementary and junior high school in Yogyakarta Province &#8211; Indonesia.</p>
<p>Well, this is the tough job. I work with some expert, teacher and education strategist to prepare the e-learning system. We should prepare learning/teaching material in digital format, train the teacher to use authoring tools and operating system, and prepare the schools to be ready to receive the PC&#8217;s. This government initiative will involve 500 schools in 3 years. Every school that involve in this program will receive 21 PCs.</p>
<p>We select openSUSE Li-f-e as the operating system in every pc. The selection is not because I&#8217;m an openSUSE member but we come to the conclusion that openSUSE Li-f-e is the most complete and well prepare distribution for education  (well, I convince other expert, some of them are Ph.D, he..he&#8230;). This year there are 110 schools involve in this program, this means another new 2310 openSUSE installation and more than 4000 new users if we assume that every PC will be used by 2 students.</p>
<p>Not only give PC to schools we also should connect the schools to the provincial data center. This is really challenging task, some areas of this province is covered by hundred of hills with karst topography and with no terestrial internet connection. Many of the schools is in that area. The road ahead still far away and difficult, but see the face of the children who really enthusiast with the openSUSE make me really happy.</p>
