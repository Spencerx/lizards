				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After several requests to get GNOME 2.24 built and made available the <a title="The openSUSE GNOME Team" href="http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME_Team">GNOME Team</a> (well <a title="Captain Magnus" href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:MBoman">Magnus Boman</a> really), took on the challenge of making it so.  Unfortunately we were a bit focused on the 11.1 release and didn&#8217;t actually think about doing any backports.  This has kind of bitten us squarely on the behind, yes we must bow to the <a title="The openSUSE KDE Team" href="http://en.opensuse.org/KDE_Team">KDE Team</a>&#8216;s backporting powers &#8211; make the most of it chaps <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately there are too many dependencies for the backport, and will involve a heck of a lot of maintenece &#8211; more so than normal.  After several attempts to coax things to work we must bow our heads in admission to being beaten <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="&#x1f641;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><em> </em>This doesn&#8217;t mean that we won&#8217;t be doing any backports in the future, the championship isn&#8217;t over just this match.  It does mean that there wont be a GNOME 2.24 for openSUSE 11.0 however, sorry to disappoint.</p>
<p>We have learnt our lesson and with the aim of not disapointing you again we have already instigated measures to ensure that your backporting needs are met.  We are already starting to build GNOME 2.25 against the current Factory and will continue to ensure that each release has the latest and greatest from the Enchanted Wood.  There may well be occaisons where things just won&#8217;t work, but we will do our utmost to minimise them and give you plenty of notice.</p>
<p>One thing we do need is your help.  Funny I always seem to be asking for help, but this time there is a really good reason (actually more than one <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).  We need more people to run Factory to test things and ensure that bugs and issues/comments are reported back.  This doesn&#8217;t just apply to GNOME but openSUSE in general, please please test our latest releases and give us your feedback.  There are several ways you can do this &#8211; Bugzilla, IRC and Mailing Lists, oh and at events like the upcoming <a title="Europe's premier Open Source event" href="http://fosdem.org/2009/">FOSDEM.</a></p>
