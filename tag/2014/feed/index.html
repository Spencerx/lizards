				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know <a title="Losah" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Losah">I&#8217;m old losah</a>! Nowadays it&#8217;s all about pads, phones and mobile this and mobile that. Install some cool stuff from app store and start mangling. I was amused how much you can do with these small entertainment units but then comes small detail that is not that cool <a title="Most popular Apple App Store categories in September 2014, by share of available apps" href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/270291/popular-categories-in-the-app-store/">over 20% stuff that is downloaded from Apple store is games and those neat utilities are just 5%</a>. I don&#8217;t know what education means but it&#8217;s after games so I think it&#8217;s good thing. What I&#8217;m trying to say stop playing for a while (it&#8217;s good thing to do. Don&#8217;t get me wrong), put pad/phone down and look around what kind of world we are living in 2014.</p>
<h2>Nah Open Source/Free Software doesn&#8217;t matter anyway</h2>
<p>In year 2014 wasn&#8217;t just year on Linux getting <a title=" Tech More: Apple Android iOS Google The iPhone 6 Had Better Be Amazing And Cheap, Because Apple Is Losing The War To Android  Read more: http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-v-android-market-share-2014-5" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-v-android-market-share-2014-5?IR=T">into you hands as Android</a>. It was strange year in Linux land. Probably biggest Linux hater from Redmond that called <a title="Linux is cancer" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/">Linux Cancer</a> said &#8216;<a title="Microsoft: It's TIME at LAST. Yes - .NET is going OPEN and X-PLATFORM" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/12/microsoft_to_open_source_dot_net/">hey Free Software and Open Source are cool!</a> <a title="Audio nerds rejoice: Windows 10 will get support for playing FLAC files next year" href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/26/windows-10-will-get-flac-support-next-year-on-top-of-mkv-and-hevc-additions/">We take cherrys</a> like Apple and sell them to you in nice package and there nothing wrong with that (And I&#8217;m with them.. it&#8217;s what they can do if you buy it)&#8217;. Small IoT (Internet-Of-Things, Industrial Internet or choose your favorite term) ARM SOC boards are so Nineties. MIPS made proud comeback! <a title="MIPS instruction set" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_instruction_set">Once it was SGI&#8217;s own bitch</a> but now there is <a title="MIPS Takes on ARM in the Internet of Things" href="http://www.linux.com/news/embedded-mobile/mobile-linux/777166-mips-takes-on-arm-internet-of-things/">growing mass of small very cheap wireless boards started to flow in</a>. All supporting Linux and most have also Android. Targeted to next big thing that you are doing when not playing.</p>
<p>In Finland where I&#8217;m located this have been year of economical rumble (read economical crash). Mass layoffs, industrial work places are getting rare and <a title="Microsoft officially welcomes the Nokia Devices and Services business" href="http://news.microsoft.com/2014/04/25/microsoft-officially-welcomes-the-nokia-devices-and-services-business/">Nokia was sold to that huge firm from Redmond</a>. Selling Nokia out was end of Finland&#8217;s mobile dreams as they <a title="Nokia N1" href="http://n1.nokia.com/en">now have new tablet</a> and fear not also <a title="Be a part of making the world’s first people powered tablet, running Sailfish OS 2.0" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jolla-tablet-world-s-first-crowdsourced-tablet">Jolla is launching their new shiny Sailfish tablet</a> and got very good funding through indie-go-go. Ok nobody really wants this tablet because of Android but it&#8217;s good to see there is guys and girls that still think with punk attitude and believe that very small firm like Jolla can produce something that big players can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Year 2014 also was big climate is changing year. USA and China make promise to cut their <a title="US and China strike deal on carbon cuts in push for global climate change pact " href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/12/china-and-us-make-carbon-pledge">carbon dioxide emission till 2030</a>. USA will do something and China says their peak will be 2030. Does this stop global warming probably not but at least now it&#8217;s official that climate is changing. How this is relevant with Linux? <a title="Supercomputer Update: Climate Models and a CO2 Snapshot " href="http://climatecrocks.com/2014/11/22/supercomputer-update-climate-models-and-a-co2-snapshot/">Most of these calculation are done in &#8216;super computers&#8217;</a> and those <a title="Linux dominates supercomputers as never before" href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-dominates-supercomputers-as-never-before/">run tadaaaa&#8230; Linux</a>. They don&#8217;t run Fedora or openSUSE because they are mostly very fast calculators but they run Linux kernel and something that as immortals never will know because most of them doesn&#8217;t calculate climate change things. They calculate nuclear war scenarios. <a title="War games" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/quotes">Hello Dr. Falken shall we play a game</a>? <a title="HP’s ‘The Machine’ &amp; the Future of Linux" href="http://fossforce.com/2014/12/hps-the-machine-the-future-of-linux/">Linux++ and HP Machine anyone</a>?</p>
<p>Firefox which is <a title="As Firefox turns 10, Mozilla introduces new ‘Forget Button’ and launches Developer Edition browser" href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/11/10/firefox-turns-10-mozilla-introduces-new-forget-button-launches-developer-focused-browser/">now 10 years</a> old. They broke up with Google because as you can see they don&#8217;t need that search flow anymore. Firefox <a title="New Search Strategy for Firefox: Promoting Choice &amp; Innovation" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/11/19/promoting-choice-and-innovation-on-the-web/">preset for searching in USA is now Yahoo, Russian Yandex and China Baidu</a>. Mozilla also made bold moves with <a title="Firefox OS" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/">Firefox OS</a> in 2014. <a title="List of Firefox OS devices" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Firefox_OS_devices">More phones</a> and if you need low end cheap phone so <a title="With Firefox OS, Mozilla begins the $25 smartphone push" href="http://www.cnet.com/news/with-firefox-os-mozilla-begins-the-25-smartphone-push/">you should consider Firefox OS phone 25$ that is very cheap</a>.</p>
<h2>So what happened in Linux land</h2>
<p>openSUSE made only <a title="openSUSE Roadmap" href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap">one release 13.2</a> but then rumbled big changes in. openSUSE is also catching up popular rolling release method like Arch Linux with Tumbleweed but this year openSUSE<a title="Factory moves to Rolling Release Development Model" href="https://news.opensuse.org/2014/07/29/factory-rolling-release/"> upstream Factory also become a rolling release</a> and then<a title="openSUSE Factory &amp; Tumbleweed Are Merging" href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTgyMjA"> it get together with Tumbleweed</a>. It&#8217;s good thing! Really things get tested and traditional releases are more stable. Hooray for that. There was and gigantic war against <a title="XLennart" href="https://github.com/Xylemon/xlennart">systemd</a> and you can start sending me millions of hate mails for a start because<strong> I Like it</strong>! It&#8217;s modern and does everything that was wrong with Linux init. No more big tune this tune that complex learn curve up to your a** stuff very neat simple configuration. Ok it&#8217;s bloat.. but why don&#8217;t you start hating Linux kernel. It&#8217;s not very UNIX nether it&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t just one thing like BSD micro-kernel approach. But that is what I wanted to say about that. If you fork <a title="Devuan" href="https://devuan.org/">Debian just to have Sysvinit</a> I think you are little bit over reacting but best luck to you I&#8217;m nothing but thumbs up get it rolling! At the end this feels like Pulseaudio hating campaign. Everybody hated it first but now nobody even notices that they are using it.</p>
<p>Also it <a title="Can we please stop talking about the Linux desktop?" href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/can-we-please-stop-talking-about-the-linux-desktop/">becomes clear 2014 that Desktop Linux will never come</a>. Time just passed by and people moved to other things and we have desktop Linux <a title="Best Chromebooks 2014" href="http://blog.laptopmag.com/best-chromebooks">Google&#8217;s Chromebooks</a>. In year 2014 <a title="No, you didn’t miss it: Samsung’s Tizen phone delayed yet again" href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-z1-tizen-launch/">It also becomes clear that nor Tizen</a> or <a title="Ubuntu Phone" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/phone">Ubuntu phone</a> will be huge success at least it takes little bit longer. My hope is that X will die in great crash of meteorite or let me rephrase how about <a title="Wayland news 2014" href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_topic&amp;q=Wayland">Wayland project</a> will never take X-windows place and things never become sweet again. Canonical  shiny move with <a title="Mir Display Server" href="http://unity.ubuntu.com/mir/">Mir display server</a> will shake things up if it becomes successful. Time will tell how things end up will Mir be successor of X or should it be Wayland?</p>
<h2>So what to give as present if you want to give Linux based device?</h2>
<p>There is so many Linux gift list to choose from that I just link to them so you <a title="10 nerdiest Linux gadgets" href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2291882/linux/151855-10-nerdiest-Linux-gadgets.html">can</a> <a title="2014 Holiday Gift Guide for open source enthusiasts" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2ndpdp/2014_holiday_gift_guide_for_open_source/">choose</a> <a title="The Geek's Guide to the Coolest Holiday Gifts" href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/geek-gift-guide">from</a> <a title="For the Linux nerd who has everything" href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2851461/linux/the-linux-holiday-shopping-guide.html">yourself</a>.</p>
<p>This was how I see year 2014. Let&#8217;s meet interesting year 2015 which is just few weeks away and light will come back and darkness fade away.</p>
