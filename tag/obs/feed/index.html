				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/12/11/opensuse-and-gcc-part-9/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 9: Open Build Service why should I use it?">Last time I talked about OBS</a> and how to compile your application that you have developed with GCC. <a href="http://openbuildservice.org/" title="Open Build Service">OBS</a> is much more than just a tool for compiling openSUSE additional packages. You can also compile <a href="http://debian.org" title="Debian ">Debian</a>, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" title="Ubuntu linux">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/" title="Arch Linux">Arch</a> and <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/" title="Fedora project">Fedora</a> (and couple more) but why on earth you want to do that? Short answer: because you can! Little bit longer answer: because you can and freedom is two way road. You can&#8217;t guess what Linux distribution or OS your user wants to use but you can make sure that you application is first class citizen in that Linux distribution.<span id="more-10387"></span> Of course You can use Fedora build service or Ubuntu launchpad but they are just for that distribution only. If it&#8217;s fine with you. Be happy and use these marvelous services. If you have woken up in night all sweat. Thinking all these openSUSE lizards that are unhappy because they can&#8217;t use your fabulous application.. it&#8217;s time to start sleeping well.</p>
<h2>Fedora distribution or RHEL</h2>
<p>RPM based Linux distributions are very easy with OBS. You just have to make SPEC file generic. If you like to do it right you should read <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_cross_distribution_howto" title="openSUSE:Build Service cross distribution howto">openSUSE:Build Service cross distribution howto</a> and learn how to do it.</p>
<h2>OBS and DEB based distributions</h2>
<p>This is little bit trickier but not much. You needed decent DSC-file (Most dsc files goes without changes. If you like to use Bzip2 file then you need to add &#8216;DEBTRANSFORM-TAR&#8217; in dsc-file) file and then you need &#8216;debian.tar.gz&#8217; in your project or &#8216;debian/&#8217;-dir in your project. What are files that you need in you debian package/dir? That is a very good question and it stays unanswered here because it&#8217;s not point of this blog. If you are curious enough you can always download &#8216;debian.tar.gz&#8217; from <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:illuusio:example/sdl_displaybitmap" title="OBS Example application">example application</a> and study files or look <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/HowToPackageForDebian" title="HowToPackageForDebian">Debian documentation</a> about it.</p>
<h2>Arch</h2>
<p>Arch is most unknown distribution for me but it has vibrant community and active development so providing packages to them is good thing. They seems to like live bleeding edge. So Just add Arch distribution in your project in OBS and then fill PKGBUILD-file with necessary lines and like magic you have Arch supported (<a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:illuusio:example/sdl_displaybitmap" title="PKGBUILD">Look at example PKGBUILD-file if you don&#8217;t understand a thing</a>).</p>
<p>This was it! No more articles about GCC or around it. Next I&#8217;ve going to dive low level Linux Multimedia especially in audio and FFmpeg (and how you do them in openSUSE). <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/author/illuusio/" title="Blog">if you haven&#8217;t read rest of articles and you feel you missed something</a>. Go on a read them and if you missed good <a href="http://smithfarm-thebrain.blogspot.fi/2013/08/opensuse-packaging-workflow.html" title="OBS client OSC">OSC-blog you can read it too</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine yourself in place where: you have succeeded to create best open source project ever appeared in face of earth. Your project has most fabulous source management system ever imagined (mostly coded by you) and you release tar balls often with plenty new neat features. You have managed that your project users provide some binary builds for Windows, Mac OS X and some bunch of Linux distributions. So your ride is smooth and pleasant (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs" title="Maslow's hierarchy of needs">Mr. Maslow just waves to you from bottom of pyramid</a>). Then black clouds arise and some Linux build manager who is doing binary builds for spefic important Linux distribution just vanishes upon the earth or you notice it would be nice to support more wide range of distributions than you allready have. Then you should consider using <a href="http://openbuildservice.org/" title="Open Build Service">Open Build Service</a> or openSUSE version of it known as <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/" title="OBS">OBS</a>.<span id="more-10255"></span></p>
<h2>OBS in nutshell</h2>
<p>Open Build Service started as named &#8216;openSUSE build Service&#8217; but name changed long time a go. Basic idea is that you can compile source package to binary package and do it on many different distributions and architectures same time. It sounds good and mostly it&#8217;s better than that.<br />
So last time I showed how to <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/12/03/opensuse-and-gcc-part-8-rpms-and-how-to-write-them/" title="openSUSE and GCC part 8: RPMs and how to write them">make RPM package</a> and now I&#8217;ll transfer it to OBS and build it. For not wasting time <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:illuusio:example" title="home:illuusio:example">I have already made project for it</a> under my home project. In project page there is plenty of stuff most of them we talk in last episode. As you can notice OBS has very good and clean web gui. All thought I&#8217;m hardcore fan of shell <strong>I really enjoy OBS webgui</strong>.</p>
<h2>Show me code</h2>
<p>If you sign up for OBS you get your own home directory and you can create sub-projects there like I did  <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:illuusio:example/sdl_displaybitmap" title="home:illuusio:example/sdl_displaybitmap">home:illuusio:example/sdl_displaybitmap</a> . Under package there is plenty of distributions currently build: Debian, Fedora, Arch and openSUSE of course. &#8216;sdl_displaybitmap.spec&#8217; is the same SPEC file as used last time with out any tuning and same goes with tar-ball file &#8216;sdl_displaybitmap-1.0.tar.bz2&#8242;. Other files you can ignore in this point.<br />
OBS thing is you can just push (with some excuses and oopses) your rpm spec file and get it compile. Now you should really read <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_guidelines" title="openSUSE:Packaging guidelines">openSUSE packaging documentation</a> because if you just gun ho forward like me did at the begin you gonna suffer and then suffer little more and then you probably die in misery and your children will be send in salt mines.</p>
<h2>This was it? now what?</h2>
<p>Look around and think if it&#8217;s for you. I like OBS enough to drop you a tip about it but it&#8217;s just my opinion. Take some time and learn how to use OBS and probably command line util &#8216;<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OSC" title="OSC">osc</a>&#8216;. Then you start to make extraneous RPM packages with OBS and start distributing your best-on-earth open source project binary packages for multiple Linux distributions with ease and speed you never have seen before or you just keep on doing what you are doing.</p>
<h2>But but I got closed source application and want to use this system</h2>
<p><strong>Okay this is shameless commercial part! Don&#8217;t read any futher if you don&#8217;t want to.</strong> Then you can <a href="http://ilmi.fi" title="Ilmi Solutions Oy">contact me</a> and i&#8217;ll consult you out or read one more <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/12/11/discussing-about-the-future-of-opensuse/" title="Open Build Servive">what reads here</a>. Like you probably find out they have version of OBS that is open source and if you set it up all by yourself it doesn&#8217;t cost you a dime or <a href="http://www.b1-systems.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=1&amp;lang=en" title="Open Build Service Consulting">save some time and buy support from B1</a> . it&#8217;s up to you again <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>

Dear community, I would like to present and get your feedback about a new project called bareos [<a href="http://www.bareos.org" target="_blank">1</a>]</p>
<p>I discovered it 6 months ago, after starting to be more and more annoyed by the way the bacula&#8217;s community edition was driven and developed. Even if I was using it since version 1.32 &#8230; First of all, I wish to be clear and shout out my respect to all the work done by Kern on Bacula or any other contributor. We have a really nice working software. We even have a nice build packages for it on OBS.<br />
But it&#8217;s stalled &#8230;</p>
<p>My personal frustration started with the creation of Bacula Enterprise, which has until now never (from what I&#8217;ve seen) reversed an Enterprise feature back to the community. Which in my sense would have been a clear statement &amp; commitment from the Bacula Enterprise to the community.<br />
A Free Software is free once it has been paid once. And more the time pass, more the community edition look like abandoned (windows client binary, bweb, &#8230;) Okay I can understand the enterprise&#8217;s edition arguments, the point is not there according to me.</p>
<p>So at the end of last year, I&#8217;ve started looking what else could replace Bacula for my own usage, and the small/medium customers I serve. Digging on github (my favorite source forge) I discovered bareos project. Basically Bareos is a fork of bacula community edition. With active contribution, and look like what I was looking for. Bareos is a compatible (at the time of writing) drop&#8217;in replacement which offers a bunch of nice feature I was waiting for. Especially high quality windows clients. The whole being cooked on a private obs instances, tested with jenkins, travis &#8230;</p>
<p>Okay I was disappointed about the fact it was a fork, but their website explains the why for those who wish to know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve then started to use it (easy to try with the number of supported platforms) and ready to use package. (Thanks to open build service [2]) Some installations were kept in a compatible way, other in native bareos way. The transition was really easy for anybody knowing how bacula works. After 3 months of production, including full restore, virtual machine backup, etc, I qualified it to be really production ready. Hey the base code and the way patches have been handled certainly explain those results. I also appreciate the effort to make bareos almost ready to use after installation. Trying to reduce the entry level ticket.</p>
<p>The remaining concerns I&#8217;ve found:<br />
- The community behind will have to grow and success in a truly transparent way.<br />
- Get new contributors (challenge is the same for bacula, but forking and propose request merge on github is really more cool than email patches)<br />
- The full remake of the documentation (work in progress)<br />
- Get a perfect web bconsole<br />
My best hope:<br />
- Make sustainable, the business plan associated with bareos.com and thus continue to produce quality community software</p>
<p>So did some of you already test it?<br />
What&#8217;s your own feedback, your thoughts about it?</p>
<p>Regards.<br />

Ricardo gave a talk about openSUSE 11.2 features and some sneak preview features on openSUSE 11.3 ( <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Product_highlights_11.3">http://en.opensuse.org/Product_highlights_11.3</a>), the openSUSE Build Service 2.0 ( <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service">http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service</a>) as software development and colaboration platform useful for any Linux distribution, SUSE Studio to customize our distribution on different enviroments, and KIWI to make an operating system image available on physical media ( <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Kiwi">http://en.opensuse.org/Kiwi</a> ). Ricardo also, answer some questions about openSUSE community and local users group, installation, as well as some questions about  Novell and Microsoft alliances were clarified. After the talk an openSUSE and Novell trivia was given and the winners got some openSUSE 11.2 CDs with Gnome Desktop by default.</p>
