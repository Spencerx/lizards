				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are plenty of Dj software available on Internet. Most popular I think are <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/traktor/dj-software/">Traktor</a> and <a href="http://www.virtualdj.com/">VirtualDJ</a>. Those are no brainier to choose and don&#8217;t support Linux. Because I&#8217;m old fart and I started doing my dang long time a go with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technics_SL-1200">Technics vinyl-players</a> (and still play my gigs with them). They work as they have always worked great but I though that I need new geeky Dj system with digital vinyls because many interesting release doesn&#8217;t do vinyls anymore and I don&#8217;t like CD-format. Summarizing all of that I wanted something that what is open source and I can still attach my digital vinyls to it (so it should work with <a href="http://serato.com/controlvinyl">Serato </a>or <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/traktor/digital-vinyl/">Traktor</a> vinyls).<br />
<span id="more-11380"></span></p>
<p>After doing little bit homework I popped up with <a href="http://xwax.org/">XWax</a> which is an open-source Digital Vinyl System (DVS) for Linux. It works great and believe me it&#8217;s geeky. Still it left me little bit blank because I liked to use some Dj controller to load music.  XWax doesn&#8217;t support Dj controller at least I didn&#8217;t get mine working. So back to square one.</p>
<p>Then I crossed <a href="http://mixxx.org/">Mixxx</a> and it looked very promising but Mixxx version 1.10 left much to hope for. After a short while they released version 1.11 which was better but I noted that plenty of MP4 format audio files didn&#8217;t work (most of the my music is encoded with Vorbis and wrapped with Ogg that works great but if you buy something they tend to favour MP4).</p>
<p>Make long story short. I get involved with Mixxx and it have very nice community, fixed non-working FFmpeg plug in and fixed handfull of Linux specific stuff. After making FFmpeg plug in working I noticed I have solved most of my digital Dj problems. Mixxx works with Linux&#8230; check, openSUSE.. thank you for asking yes, is open source&#8230; GPLv2, Dj controllers.. <a href="http://mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/hardware_compatibility">long list</a>,  Digital vinyls.. <a href="http://mixxx.org/manual/latest/chapters/vinyl_control.html">serato and traktor</a> and have nice working skinnable interface.. check.</p>
<p>Only thing is that Mixxx is using Portaudio with Linux and Portaudio doesn&#8217;t play nice with Pulseaudio but <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:illuusio:portaudio">I wrote patch for Portaudio</a> and it&#8217;s currently in &#8216;works for me&#8217;-stage which means late Beta. If I ever got time I&#8217;ll give it a facelift, commit it to Github and generate little bit documentation and try to again get it to official Portaudio</p>
<p>But if you are open source Dj and like to test state-of-art version (which is light years ahead last one) of Mixxx I&#8217;ll recommend to test Mixxx version <a href="http://mixxx.org/download/">1.12 beta</a>. You should understand it&#8217;s Beta software and if you <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx">find bug please report it</a>. But if you want to stick with stable Mixxx version 1.11 there is nothing wrong with that it&#8217;s also very capable application.</p>
<p>In openSUSE you can download it with zypper from <a href="http://packman.links2linux.org/">Packman repos</a>.</p>
