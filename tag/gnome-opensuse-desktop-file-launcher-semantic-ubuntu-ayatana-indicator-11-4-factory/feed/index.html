				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some time ago a openSUSE user mentioned to me if we had <a href="http://launchpad.net/synapse-project" target="_blank">synapse</a> available for openSUSE or what was required to have it around. I took a look into it and asked some advice in #opensuse-gnome regarding the availability of libzeitgeist which is one of the requirements to build this piece of software.</p>
<p>Some time ago Federico Quintero has posted a <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-gnome/2011-01/msg00016.html" target="_blank">message</a> on the opensuse-gnome mailing list regarding his work on the Zeitgeist stack. The rest of the dependencies for this package are provided by my work on the availability of Ubuntu&#8217;s software on openSUSE. From my work I took <a href="http://launchpad.net/dee" target="_blank">dee</a> and <a href="http://launchpad.net/libappindicator" target="_blank">libappindicator</a> and builded a test package of synapse on <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-gnome/2011-01/msg00020.html" target="_blank">home:ketheriel:ayatana</a>. This package is here until I see this dependencies hit factory on time (libzeitgeist, dee and libappindicator). If anyone wants to test it out, go ahead.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6551" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screenshot-synapse-1.png" alt="" width="638" height="226" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screenshot-synapse-1.png 638w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screenshot-synapse-1-300x106.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I&#8217;m not sure of the functionality that should be present on this vala application, but for the time being I&#8217;ve disabled the Application Indicator on the build (needs hammering on the linking). I&#8217;ll take a closer look once I have some more free time. So far this should be working only for openSUSE Factory and openSUSE 11.4 milestones.</p>
<p>Synapse is a semantic file launcher (pretty much the same as hitting ALT+F2 on a GNOME session) with some crazy looks and a battalion of plugins. Once the dependencies are ok, I&#8217;ll maintain this package and push it to the GNOME:Apps repository.</p>
