				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>openSUSE 12.1 is on its way, and recently LXDE got some major updates.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m personally always been really satisfied of how LXDE works and is integrated into the openSUSE user experience, one defect though , that I&#8217;m really sorry about, is that i was never able to provide a very nice look&amp;feel.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not a graphic, and i realized I&#8217;m failing, i decide to ask your help now.</p>
<p>Here is what we need:</p>
<p>1) A gtk2 + openbox theme (including lxpanel background and icon theme)</p>
<p>2) A theme for lxdm (you can use /usr/share/lxdm/themes/Industrial as template), and eventually a background too</p>
<p>Also, i would like to open a contest. Your goal is create a logo for openSUSE-LXDE project.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have more information as soon as possible about this contest on the opensuse-lxde@o.o mailing list and here on lizards, please keep in mind that we want to print the winning logo on t-shirts too.</p>
<p>Up to date info about the contest will be available in the wiki <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:LXDE_Logo_Contest" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>I hope lot&#8217;s of you will help.</p>
<p>Andrea</p>
