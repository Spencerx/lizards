<p>Thanks! OK, just a reminder that you have less than 160 hours to register for the openSUSE board election if you haven&#8217;t done so already.</p>
<p>For the mathematically challenged, 160 hours is just under seven full days! Yes, that is how long you have left to get your <a title="openSUSE Membership details" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Members">membership</a> application in to be able to vote on the upcoming <a title="openSUSE's First Community voted board" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Board_Election">board election</a>.  It is also the amount of time you have left to get your notification of intention to run for the <a title="Board Election 08" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Board_Election/2008">first community elected Board</a>.</p>
<p>You can only run for the board if you hold openSUSE Membership, you can only vote for your favourite candidates if you have openSUSE Membership.  Do you see a pattern here? Good!</p>
<p>Also it would be good if all of the current candidates could ensure that they have filled in their platforms on the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Board_Election/2008">openSUSE wiki</a> as requested before then.  Some have already, I appreciate that people are busy, but if you want to be on the Board (or vote for the board) you have to be prompt.  Slackers will not be tolerated! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
