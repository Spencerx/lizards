				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will go on holiday next week, so today is my last day in the office. I have decided that the things I have to do today are too many and I should work in the train in my way to the office.</p>
<p>All good, start the computer, of course no internet, so I had to shutdown kontact to stop him crying about not being able to connect.</p>
<p>Being able to easy go to an offline modeÂ  would be a very nice and useful feature to have in kontact, and kde applications in general. Checking that before you want to communicate with some third party that you actually have the phone instead complaining that he is not answer, would be a very good design decision, too.</p>
<p>Now being the holiday season I hope at least one of the kde/kontact developers would get hit by this missing feature and soon we will have it.</p>
