				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At one of the project meetings, it was highlighted that our selected <a href="http://opensuse.blip.tv">video service provider</a> isn&#8217;t the easiest to reach from some parts of the world.  So I was assigned the task of finding an alternative/complimentary service that would be acceptable.</p>
<p>The decision I came to, and confirmed with others that they were happy, was to use YouTube as a complimentary service to BlipTV.  So yes people we now have an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/opensusetv">Official YouTube channel</a>.  I&#8217;d like to say a huge thanks to Leslie Hawthorn for enabling this for us, and the fine folks over at Google &amp; YoutTube.  There is very little content on there at the moment, but that will change shortly as I will sync the content from BlipTV across.</p>
<p>The rationale for keeping BlipTV as our primary provider is:<br />
* They allow people to download the original video file without having to login etc.  This is great as it means we can keep providing video in open formats for all to consume.<br />
* It provides us with the means of centralising distribution of all the videos.  We upload to BlipTV and they take care of adding it to YouTube and anywhere else we want (should we upload to Facebook too?)<br />
* They&#8217;re a great bunch of guys &amp; gals who are very responsive to support requests and general queries &#8211; their customer service is superb!<br />
* Oh and last but by no means least, they&#8217;re big OpenSourcers using Linux (granted it&#8217;s Gentoo but we like the Gentoo community don&#8217;t we? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ), and a wealth of open source software (ffmpeg, gstreamer etc).</p>
<p>This means that the likes of <a href="http://tube.opensuse.org">tube.o.o</a> may well be removed in the near future, as all the content will be stored online and offered to the widest possible audience, without a strain on any resources on openSUSE&#8217;s end.  If anyone has any issues with either service please let me know.</p>
