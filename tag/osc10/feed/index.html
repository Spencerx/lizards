				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So Stage 1 of the next openSUSE Conference is complete (submission deadline), and we are moving forward with Stage 2 (scheduling talks).  I personally wasn&#8217;t privvy to last year&#8217;s submissions, but we have well over 80 submissions covering a huge range of topics this year which is brilliant.</p>
<p>One of the nice things this year is we have submissions from other distributions and projects, which is great <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  The submissions from all parties cover a wide variety of topics from very technical to very fun, and it isn&#8217;t going to be easy to select which ones to accept.</p>
<p>Thank you to all who submitted a proposal and we will let you know on 20th August whether you are succesful or not.  </p>
