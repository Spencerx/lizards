				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hk59dxq0jrppyhn/promote.jpg?raw=1" alt="Promote your event" width="50%" height="50%"></p>
<p><a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2015/03/26/how-to-organize-start-an-open-source-community/" target="1">Local open source community</a> is bigger now and next step for you is to organise (or join) global conferences. One part of the organisation is the promotion of the conference. You want to have as many visitors as you can.</p>
<p>I will try to write down what I did during openSUSE global conferences and some local events.</p>
<p><b>BEFORE THE EVENT</b></p>
<p><b>0. Web page</b></p>
<p>There MUST be a web page and a system that accepts registration, paper submission, information etc. Write everything that visitor should know about the conference.<br />
We use <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osem" target="1">OSEM</a> in openSUSE. Check out <a href="https://events.opensuse.org" target="1">https://events.opensuse.org</a></p>
<p><b>1. Blog blog blog.</b></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have some announcements for the conference. Dates, the place, new website, call for papers announcement, hotels that visitors can stay, schedule, keynote speakers etc. Usually, every open source project has a central blog or news site. You can write the articles there. Try to make fuzz by publishing your articles often.<br />
Global communities can translate the announcements to their language and promote the conference locally.</p>
<p>Local communities are formed by members with blogs who publish on different planet sites. You can make a schedule so everyone can publish the announcement every other day. More eyes will see the announcement and will apply either as speaker or visitor.</p>
<p>Two things you want to have is contributors+visitors and sponsors. If your project is famous, then it&#8217;s easy. If not, then you better publish the initial announcement to magazines, newspapers, technical blogs-sites. If you don&#8217;t have access, then you better send it by e-mail or fax and then call them and ask them if they got the text. If they publish it, you&#8217;re lucky.</p>
<p>Translate those announcements and publish them, so local population will see that there&#8217;s a conference coming.</p>
<p><b>2. Promote to other FOSS conferences</b></p>
<p>There are plenty of FOSS conferences around the world.<br />
* Community (local or global) has to apply for a booth and/or, if it&#8217;s possible, present  why someone should attend.<br />
* At the booth, you should have promo materials of your conference and give away to local LUGs or hackerspaces to hang posters at their places.<br />
* Another cool thing is to have free coupons for beer at the conference. If beer isn&#8217;t the solution, then find another thing that can be found only at your conference and give free coupons.<br />
* Wear special T-Shirts with the logo or #oSC or &#8220;Ask me for the conference&#8221;. You show people that you&#8217;re organizing something and can ask you questions.<br />
* Finally, go to other project&#8217;s booth and invite them. You can ask them if they want to have a booth at your conference or apply for a presentation.</p>
<p><b>3. Messages to post</b></p>
<p>Create a list of messages you&#8217;ll post to social media.<br />
First of all, you should post the announcements.<br />
Then create a list of general messages that you should post before the conference. Content will be related to the subject of the conference or the country etc.<br />
When you have the schedule ready, create a post with the name of the person (mention him/her on the social media), the title of the presentation (mention if it&#8217;s a famous project).<br />
The messages can be 2-3 per day but not the same time. Try to have 4-5 hours time delay between tweets.<br />
<span id="more-11331"></span></p>
<p><b>4. Twitter</b></p>
<p>Create a twitter account that will be used for the conference. Everyone can use it as hashtag (#) and also can communicate with you before and during the conference. For openSUSE we had #opensuseconf as hashtag. The account was @opensuseconf<br />
The same account can create the Lanyard event (you&#8217;ll see next).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ancddxgo60jijnc/facebook-twitter-head.jpg?raw=1" alt="Twitter" width="50%" height="50%"></p>
<p><b>5. Facebook event page</b></p>
<p>Create a Facebook event page under the official account of the project. Post the tweets here as well. Post the messages (no 2). If you have some cool documentation of the subject that will be presented, just post it.</p>
<p>Since the address will be difficult to remember, create a subdomain under your project&#8217;s name (eg facebook.conference.opensuse.org) that will forward it to the event page.</p>
<p><b>6. Google Plus event page</b></p>
<p>Do the same as facebook. Some people hate to use facebook, so google plus is the solution. Do the same also with the URL.<br />
Google Plus event notifies to e-mail every user about changes. So if you post, they&#8217;ll get a notification. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2aod8ecroyzhg9m/google-plus.png?raw=1" alt="Google plus" width="30%" height="30%"></p>
<p><b>7. <a href="http://lanyrd.com/" target="1">Lanyard event page</a></b></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t very famous but it&#8217;s very cool. It uses twitter accounts. You setup the event and when you have the schedule, you can add the subject and mention the speaker. You can also use it to post announcements.<br />
Here is the lanyard of <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/osc14/" target="1">openSUSE conference 2014</a></p>
<p><b>8. Meetup.com event</b></p>
<p>If money is not an issue for your project, you can create an event at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">http://www.meetup.com</a></p>
<p><b>9. IRC, mailing lists, forums</b></p>
<p>You have to create an IRC channel where you reply all possible questions. There&#8217;s also mailing list for that.<br />
To promote the conference, you should post the announcement to mailing lists, forum of all possible projects (eg if we&#8217;re oprnSUSE, then post to GNOME, KDE, ownCloud etc). And try to inform the posts with the new announcements.</p>
<p><b>10. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/" target="1">Flickr</a></b></p>
<p>Create a group where people can upload their pictures, so everyone who blogs can use those pictures. You can create it before the event starts and post picture from the venue, before you set it up.</p>
<p><b>DURING THE EVENT</b></p>
<p><b>1. Messages to post</b></p>
<p>Create a document with messages to post with all the presentations. The message has to be:</p>
<p><i>Presentation title (with mention) @ #Room_name. Not @ #oSC15 #openSUSE? Live @ Stream_URL</i></p>
<p>Create a table. Columns will be the rooms, rows will be the timetable. So you&#8217;ll check the time and post the right one.</p>
<p>WARNING: Check with program team if there was a day change of the program. Also check the right Stream URL.</p>
<p><b>2. Twitter</b></p>
<p>Here you start posting the messages per time. Don&#8217;t forget the mentions to people, projects and the #. Here you mention someone by using <b>@username</b>.</p>
<p><b>3. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/581478758605508/" target="1">Facebook event page</a></b></p>
<p>Same as Twitter, don&#8217;t forget to mention. Here mention is with <b>@Project name</b>. Here you can use more characters that twitter. So here you can also add the hashtag of your project (eg #opensuse, #opensuseconf)<br />
Ask people upload pictures here. Also ask people to post their reports.</p>
<p><b>4. <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/c9cg77dsk32ci7jaf4rqbqbnvlg" target="1">Google plus event page</a></b></p>
<p>Same as Twitter, don&#8217;t forget to mention. Here mention is with <b>+Project name</b>. Here you can use more characters that twitter. So here you can also add the hashtag of your project (eg #opensuse, #opensuseconf).<br />
Again, ask people to upload pictures here.  Also ask people to post their reports.</p>
<p><b>5. IRC</b></p>
<p>You can post here as well. Some people didn&#8217;t join you or they just see live streaming and use IRC to ask the speaker. So it&#8217;ll be nice if theres the program of what&#8217;s in every room with the streaming URL.</p>
<p><b>6. Streaming</b></p>
<p>The social media guy is responsible to handle all the above. He checks if the streaming is working and if not, then warns the video team. It&#8217;s good for him because he can see all presentations but it&#8217;s kind of &#8220;I&#8217;m locked somewhere and I don&#8217;t mingle with people&#8221;.<br />
Users who didn&#8217;t make it, they can see the conference over the Interent.</p>
<p><b>7. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/osc13/" target="1">Flickr</a></b></p>
<p>Try to gather all pictures and upload them in the afternoon, so everyone who wants to blog, can use the pictures from there (there are Google Plus and Facebook events as alternatives). It&#8217;s very cool if the pictures are up very soon, so everyone can view them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past days I&#8217;ve been packaging and fixing some issues on Unity 2D for inclusion on the GNOME:Ayatana repository in the openSUSE Build Service.</p>
<p>This gave me an excellent opportunity to test a few components share by both, Unity and Unity 2D, which is the case of &#8216;unity-place-applications&#8217; and &#8216;unity-place-files&#8217;, both using Zeitgeist which is already in Factory for the upcoming openSUSE 12.1. We thank the integration of this packages to Federico Quintero. Thanks Fred.</p>
<p>A few more additional packages need some care and once they get updated and tested they will be uploaded to GNOME:Ayatana, at which time I will provide an installer (1-Click) for those willing to test Unity-2D. Unity 2D will be the first application to use the indicators I have prepared in the past which all all found working, except 1, the AppMenu (strangely it works on GNOME2 panel without issues).</p>
<p>This is how Unity 2D looks like. There are transparencies because I enabled &#8216;composite&#8217; on metacity, which works very nicely. As far as I could understand, the developers of Unity 2D are also looking into implementing Compiz with Unity 2D, which would be sweet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot.png" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7354" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot.png" alt="" width="720" height="404" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot.png 1366w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot-300x168.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot-1024x575.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a></p>
<p>Unity introduces the &#8216;dash&#8217; which is pretty much the following screen. Transparencies are enabled (though metacity composite) and the notification bubble belongs to NotifyOSD (already present in openSUSE 11.4 as optional). This is one of the three issues I have to fix, the icons displayed on the dash should have text underneath, it&#8217;s not showing. The top icons are quick links to Program Categories and the ones bellow are the default applications which are setup in GNOME.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7355" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot1.png" alt="" width="720" height="404" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot1.png 1366w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot1-300x168.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot1-1024x575.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The launcher panel on the side auto-hides, and seems to be working. The three icons displayed in last are respectively: Workspace selector, applications menu and files. Everything seems to be working with them, and the 2 last are components shared with Unity, and they both rely on Zeitgeist. Here&#8217;s a few captures of what they do&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7356" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot2.png" alt="" width="720" height="404" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot2.png 1366w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot2-300x168.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot2-1024x575.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7357" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="720" height="404" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot-1.png 1366w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot-1-300x168.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot-1-1024x575.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot-2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-7358  aligncenter" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="730" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">There&#8217;s also a feature from Unity which is cute&#8230; The title artifact of the decorator window (metacity, which required a few patches) is removed and implemented on the top bar when the window is maximized. Sadly for me the AppMenu (menu proxy) isn&#8217;t working properly, this is another thing that needs fixing&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot3.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-7363    aligncenter" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot3.png" alt="" width="720" height="404" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot3.png 1366w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot3-300x168.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screenshot3-1024x575.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">This should cover pretty much the functionality that is available currently. There&#8217;s a few issues still remaining before I can push this to GNOME:Ayatana:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&#8211; I tried not to have the need to patch gnome-session, but since Unity relies on the Session Indicator to have this functionality, gnome-session will need to be patched (should be ok, because it also requires the backport patch for  defining &#8211;sessions for openSUSE 11.4).</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&#8211; Unity 2D itself relies on a few gconf hacks that should be on a schema file. I&#8217;ve talked to upstream and this is planned already, so once it&#8217;s release, that&#8217;s when it will be published.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&#8211; There&#8217;s one issue also with backgrounds and workspace switcher&#8230; unfortunatly the workspace switcher only renders wallpapers if they are in image format (no .xml stuff), so this can turn some wallpapers not to render, which eventually ends up in the background of the switcher being the one defined in GNOME as solid color.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">So the order of TODO&#8217;s for GNOME:Ayatana is pretty much this one:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">1. Implement dependencies and then Unity 2D;<br />
2. Make sure Compiz is well implemented, because Unity will require Compiz at it&#8217;s best shape;<br />
3. Make sure nux and other twisted dependencies are properly implemented;<br />
4. Implement Unity itself;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">This are the latest news for GNOME:Ayatana&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was brought to my attention through I <a href="http://karl-tux-stadt.de/ktuxs/?p=3176" target="_blank">article</a> (german) the existence of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gpick/" target="_blank">gpick</a>, an advanced and high featured color picker. I&#8217;ve taken a quick look at it to make it available for openSUSE as it seems an interesting tool for artists and web designers (maybe GTK3+ themers) and others.</p>
<p>To build this package a few files are generated with the <a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/" target="_blank">Lemon Parser Generator</a> which isn&#8217;t really available. I&#8217;m contacting upstream regarding the possibility of including the generated files in the tarball, or eventually if that fails, I&#8217;ll probably need to include lemon.c, hand compile it and hack scons build to use the local binary to generate those files.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The screenshots have a tiny glitch on an icon, this is mainly because I haven&#8217;t rebuilt the icon cache when I took them. I look forward to explore the possibility of having such a great tool available for openSUSE 12.1.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I&#8217;ve made available a small test package on <strong><a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Aketheriel%3Agpick" target="_blank">home:ketheriel:gpick</a></strong> (needs some work before submitting to factory) which should be working. Any testing/feedback will be most welcomed. Also enabled builds for Fedora 14, since I believe this package isn&#8217;t available for Fedora.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the release of GNOME3 I would assume that people are interested in seeing how YaST2 (suggestion: rename it to YaST3 !!) is going to take form with GTK3. Of course this means eventually writing another application in GTK3, hopefully different from the old gnome-control-panel &#8216;style&#8217; which was actually pretty confusion from the user point of view as it was far too close to gnome-control-center, thus confusing new comers.</p>
<p>My suggestion (unaware if it&#8217;s possible or not) was probably to explore GNOME3 features to serve YaST integrated already with GNOME3. This could be an interesting approach as it would offer integration and some advantages:</p>
<p>* Better integration with GNOME3 without having to write(/maintain another application;<br />
* Take advantage of YaST2 modular structure;<br />
* Present YaST in a prime space in GNOME3, thus offering a openSUSE differentiation point;<br />
* No conflicts with possible KDE existing front-ends for YaST2;<br />
* Improve users experience.</p>
<p>My proposal would be something like (maybe to be served as an extension for gnome-shell). Please neglect my &#8216;lame&#8217; photo manipulation skills:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>For some time I wanted to check out GNOME3 and gnome-shell&#8230; My current chipset is ATI M92 RV710 and while the thermal performance with the proprietary driver is somewhat what I expect, the open source radeon driver does overheat my laptop a lot compared to flgrx. For the time being, fglrx isn&#8217;t really a choice because it just borgs the &#8216;activities&#8217; bar on top&#8230; And until ATI fixes their driver, there&#8217;s no other choice than running with the standard radeon drm driver, which does provide a very pleasant experience with GNOME3 / gnome-shell.</p>
<p>For all that matters, KMS is to be enabled, period, full stop. And from this point&#8230; we have two options regarding power management:</p>
<p>1. Dynamic Frequency switching (not really working for me);<br />
2. Profile based frequency switching (does provide what I need);</p>
<p>For all that matters regarding &#8216;profile based frequency switching&#8217; we have 5 profiles available:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;default&#8221; uses the default clocks and does not change the power state. This is the default behavior.</li>
<li>&#8220;auto&#8221; selects between &#8220;mid&#8221; and &#8220;high&#8221; power states based on the whether the system is on battery power or not. The &#8220;low&#8221; power state are selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.</li>
<li>&#8220;low&#8221; forces the gpu to be in the low power state all the time. Note that &#8220;low&#8221; can cause display problems on some laptops; this is why auto only uses &#8220;low&#8221; when displays are off.</li>
<li>&#8220;mid&#8221; forces the gpu to be in the &#8220;mid&#8221; power state all the time. The &#8220;low&#8221; power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.</li>
<li>&#8220;high&#8221; forces the gpu to be in the &#8220;high&#8221; power state all the time. The &#8220;low&#8221; power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, what I did might not be an option to everyone, but for sure it does provide a nice solution for my problem&#8230; So be mindful of that&#8230; this is a personal preference based on the fact that I don&#8217;t require intensive GPU usage, neither I run intensive GPU requiring applications within GNOME3/gnome-shell (I have a normal openSUSE 11.4 with GNOME 2.32.x with fglrx dual boot config for those apps).</p>
<p>The first thing we might want to do is to switch to profile based frequency switching&#8230; how do we this? As root:</p>
<p>[code] echo profile &gt; /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method[/code]</p>
<p>Now we have to pick one of those 5 profiles&#8230; and since I&#8217;ve already stated&#8230; I want the &#8216;low&#8217; profile since I don&#8217;t really do much intensive GPU work&#8230;</p>
<p>[code] echo low &gt; /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile[/code]</p>
<p>Now&#8230; you might want to check out the different profiles and the different clocks used&#8230; this can be done through:</p>
<p>[code] ﻿cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/radeon_pm_info[/code]</p>
<p>and will report something like this:</p>
<p>[code]﻿linux-331w:~ # cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/radeon_pm_info<br />
default engine clock: 680000 kHz<br />
current engine clock: 299530 kHz<br />
default memory clock: 800000 kHz<br />
current memory clock: 249750 kHz<br />
voltage: 900 mV<br />
PCIE lanes: 16[/code]</p>
<p>This one is using the &#8216;low&#8217; profile&#8230; Feel free to test stuff around and find which one better answers your needs&#8230; Also there&#8217;s far more that can be done&#8230; I hope this helps ATI users with DRM driver to bring out the best of your system and improves your GNOME3 / gnome-shell experience, at so that you can run it with good thermal performance without fglrx.</p>
<p>NM</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<p>Some brief updates about the ongoing work towards bringing Ayatana Project software into openSUSE:</p>
<p><strong>1. Software Updates</strong></p>
<p>Canonical recently released a batch of updates which bring new functionality (Indicators seem to respond faster now) and very nice improvements, some of them contributed by down-streamers. From my humble experience I would risk to claim that Canonical is doing an excellent job as an upstreamer. I&#8217;ve updated all packages to the latest versions. This allowed to remove some patches.</p>
<p><strong>2. Unity</strong></p>
<p>Unity is now one step closer. For Unity I&#8217;ve started to package Compiz git snapshots from the correct branches pointed by Unity documentation. This brought something new to me, cmake. I&#8217;ve done this very slowly, reading some docs meanwhile about cmake. My packaging around Compiz is mainly based on OBS X11:Compiz repository, so pretty much all the credits should be for the original project Packagers which done an awesome job. Currently I&#8217;m missing only 3 packages to test Unity. Recently with kernel and mesa updates some issues around ATI hardware seem to have fixed for openSUSE Factory users, which enabled in my case FireGL, therefore I can test properly Unity now and check for the integration into openSUSE.</p>
<p>Unity by default uses the Ayatana&#8217;s Indicators, and if they are not present, it will fallback to GNOME&#8217;s applets. This is very nice and I&#8217;m thankful Canonical made it this way. This brings non-Ubuntu users the Unity experience at almost no trouble, since there isn&#8217;t actually much patching required to implement Unity.</p>
<p><strong>3. GNOME:Ayatana Repository</strong></p>
<p>GNOME:Ayatana Repository will be populated during the next two weeks with the latest changes and will provide for the time being the Ayatana&#8217;s Indicators and Unity. I am currently working around libappindicator stack and it&#8217;s Indicators. Currently I&#8217;m testing the patches required on the GTK+ stack and this is pretty much the last barrier before going into #STAGE2, polishing and populating GNOME:Ayatana.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not decided yet what packages are going to present on Factory. My wish is to push only Unity into Factory and it&#8217;s dependencies, this might not happen for 11.4 as I&#8217;m not sure about the freeze schedules and it might be too late already, but since we&#8217;re depending on Compiz upstream, we&#8217;ll see what happens. Even if Unity isn&#8217;t going to be available on Factory, I&#8217;m sure we can use KIWI or SUSE Studio to release a small openSUSE Unity Spin.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also decided that I (typo: previously would) <strong>wouldn&#8217;t</strong> like to see Unity available by openSUSE before the official release from Ubuntu, for which I wish all the success.</p>
<p>Since the very early start that I&#8217;ve been using pkg-config as much as I can. According to some information that I collected previously, this would be great for cross-distribution build. Depending on the time and work done, I might make the necessary modifications and enable cross-distribution building on this project, thus, making it available for other RPM distributions supported by OBS. This will require a bit of testing before, so it will be work to be done after 11.4 is released and during it&#8217;s lifecycle. Maybe by the time of openSUSE 12 gets released, we will have this project also available for other RPM based distributions. I have no knowledge on Debian packaging, but Ubuntu ships this software and Debian probably has it also available so&#8230; that won&#8217;t be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>4. Artwork</strong></p>
<p>I am providing on GNOME:Ayatana Ubuntu&#8217;s Light Themes (Ambiance and Radiance) and offering a patched version of Metacity that renders those themes perfectly. I&#8217;m not changing the original colors from the themes or modifying them in any way. So they might be a bit more of orange and not green.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve contacted some people to ask if they would be willing to donate some artwork to make a small package with Wallpapers, some have answered yes, so I will make a small package with a couple of wallpapers for the traditional resolutions and distribute it alongside with this software as optional as always.</p>
<p><strong>5. GTK2, GTK3 and QT</strong></p>
<p>Implementation of GTK3 will be done within the next days, as I am also considering enabling QT support for KDE users (Indicators only for now).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much the result of the last days of work&#8230; more news to come in the nearby future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection will come even more effective action.&#8221; // <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker" target="_blank">Peter F. Drucker</a></p>
<p>This has been one of the guidelines in my life for quite some time&#8230; It started as a curiosity a long time ago with <a href="http://launchpad.net/notify-osd" target="_blank">Notify OSD</a> and evolved to full project in openSUSE. It is important to acknowledge at this point the motivation provided by the openSUSE GNOME Team from which I&#8217;ve been getting plenty of guidance and help, namely from Vincent Untz (vuntz) and Dominique ﻿Leuenberger (Dimstar). Thanks to them, we have now a <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=GNOME:Ayatana" target="_blank">GNOME:Ayatana</a> Project on OBS (<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Build_Service" target="_blank">openSUSE Build Service</a>), currently being populated with the support libraries for Ayatana&#8217;s Unity and Indicators.</p>
<p>Susan Linton has made a small <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/ubuntu-indicators-opensuse" target="_blank">article for Linux Journal</a> about this project in the past. Though some people pointed to me that it was advertising and excelling Ubuntu&#8230; I would like to leave a statement&#8230; We&#8217;re not taking a hike on Ubuntu visibility, and it isn&#8217;t bad at all, on the contrary&#8230; In fact it will help Ubuntu, us and many others&#8230; specially if some Ubuntu patches are accepted faster by upstream. I hope other RPM distributions will follow the way we, openSUSE, proudly seem to pioneering! From my personal point of view&#8230; a distribution &#8216;distributes&#8217;&#8230; and despite this software isn&#8217;t attractive for some openSUSE users, I&#8217;m happy it is available (totally or partially) for all those who want to test it&#8230; Wait&#8230; you don&#8217;t even need to install Ubuntu or changing the platform you run!</p>
<p>Due to several reasons, being the most important of them versioning, this repository will start on the next release of openSUSE in March 16th (World day of Conscience, interesting point). This is also interesting as if <strong>YOU</strong> are willing to improve a package or submit a package you can now do it to this repository.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot-nmarques@magtheridon...ketherielayatana.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-6269 aligncenter" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot-nmarques@magtheridon...ketherielayatana.png" alt="" width="786" height="152" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot-nmarques@magtheridon...ketherielayatana.png 786w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot-nmarques@magtheridon...ketherielayatana-300x58.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px" /></a></p>
<p>This goes with a very huge cookie for Dimstar and Vuntz for taking care of this repository and making sure that everything will comply with the openSUSE Guidelines. You are my personal heroes.</p>
<p>It has been quite an interesting experience to be with openSUSE GNOME team which is full of knowledge and helpful in many ways. I can&#8217;t also forget to mention that last week Luis Medinas has taken tutorship of a Portuguese contributor to openSUSE GNOME, João Matias and will provide him the necessary help to integrate him on the workflow of the GNOME Team. My personal thanks to Luis for stepping into this task, which from my personal point of view is very important.</p>
<p>Regarding to Ayatana it is worth to mention that Dimstar provided some valuable help in fixing the dbusmenu package and taking care of the necessary patch submission in GTK and gdk-pixbuf to allow dbusmenu to build with introspection support and generate properly the Vala files required for other packages. This handicap beaten&#8230; we&#8217;re on the good road for better functionality. This patches also allowed to correct some behavior in some indicators, one fine example of this the &#8216;Me Menu&#8217; which now displays correctly a  &#8216;dot&#8217; on the selected status as the screenshot bellow shows:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot-13.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6270" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot-13.png" alt="" width="500" height="345" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot-13.png 500w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot-13-300x207.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>In the last days, despite it&#8217;s Christmas season and soon new year&#8230;. I&#8217;ve been also working on providing additional extensions to enable some functionality on some indicators. This was the case of indicator-sound, which provides an alternative sound gadget that offers extended functionality with multimedia players. A fine example of this is Novell&#8217;s Banshee player which has astonishing out of the box implementation with the sound indicator from Ayatana by a small extension that can be enabled. I&#8217;m still wondering why so many people toss heavy critics at this indicator calling it &#8216;mac styled&#8217;&#8230; while to be honest I doubt such people have even seen OSX sound applet, which is more or less a direct copy of the one present in GNOME, the vertical switch. Interesting view nevertheless.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot-3.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-6271 aligncenter" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot-3.png" alt="" width="500" height="345" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot-3.png 500w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot-3-300x207.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Indicator-sound has also been fixed and no longer requires the nasty hack in the previous package. Since I&#8217;m not an Ubuntu user, neither I have extensive experience on their Desktop, I&#8217;m not sure if the functionality present so far in the indicators is the one offered by Ubuntu. I plan to run a Open Beta on the Ayatana software repository during the last Milestone of Factory to all Factory users to collect more data and improve the packages, at least the indicators, as in the present since I have ATI hardware I don&#8217;t have FireGL enabled on Factory, so I can&#8217;t really push much on Unity and test it for the time being.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Another subject of plugins was <a href="http://xchat.org" target="_blank">Xchat</a> which is GNOME&#8217;s premier IRC client. Novell&#8217;s Evolution also got it&#8217;s plugin which is found to be partially working. I haven&#8217;t tracked yet if there are patch submissions to Evolution from Ubuntu to enable indicator functionality. That&#8217;s for sure one of the next steps, and since Evolution is a bit of &#8216;in-house&#8217;, would be nice to have them approved upstream if submitted already, as it would serve openSUSE as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Most of this applications, evolution, xchat, gwibber, empathy, pidgin are supported by indicator messages which collects information from several messaging services and places them on a single indicator in a cascade style experience for the user. I personally find it weird as I&#8217;m not used to this, but seems nice. Unfortunalty some applications seem rely on patches to be fully supported, like empathy. I hope upstream accepts the patches from Ubuntu (if submitted) and we can also benefit from such changes in our side.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6273" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot3.png" alt="" width="500" height="343" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot3.png 500w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screenshot3-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Basically to sum up everything in a short review&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">* Indicators are working fully or partially depending on patch level on some applications. If upstream starts accepting Ubuntu patches (some shouldn&#8217;t be much of a problem), it will work out for Ayatana software in openSUSE as well.<br />
* Unity &#8211; Though it builds already with some compiz packaged from git sources (to include glib mainloop patching), I have no way of testing it, neither I have done integration on it. Unfortunately both my systems have ATI hardware and I have no way of testing it on Factory which seems to be too much bleeding edge for ATI to keep up. It&#8217;s stalled a bit, but in the worst scenario will be available a few weeks after the next official release of openSUSE.<br />
* During this wait time&#8230; we might see a new release of compiz with the patches upstreamed by Canonical, which will for sure help us also a lot. No need for hurry in Unity at this time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">My personal experience with this project has given me lots of knowledge about OBS, hacking Makefiles and configure scripts&#8230; debug skills&#8230; and specially I ended up loving the way openSUSE is built and how it works. I would take also this opportunity to make a small statement&#8230; all the development so far has been deployed over GNOME 2.32. Much of the software packaged already supports GTK3 and should be easy to migrate it to GNOME3. At the moment, since the next openSUSE release is still based on GNOME 2.32, I&#8217;m not testing all this software on GNOME3. It might take a few days/weeks to have it available for GNOME3 after it&#8217;s release, though from a personal perspective, what I&#8217;ve seen on GNOME3 seems to be overkill! It&#8217;s damn nice and I have no doubt GNOME3 will succeed as the ultimate Free Desktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I would also like to mention that I&#8217;m not testing this indicators with KDE. In case someone wants to do this, please feel free to nag me on IRC (#opensuse-gnome @ Freenode) and leave feedback. I&#8217;m focused only on GNOME2 and GNOME3 deployment of this software packages, though I will help in whatever way I can if someone wants to work them out for KDE.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I&#8217;m using a patched version of Metacity (patches were submitted upstream) which improves the display of buttons by improving overlaying of images (I think). Look at the sharp corners of the theme in the pic bellow. As always, Faenza Icon theme with Canonical&#8217;s light theme Radiance (not hacked). This is another change I hope that goes upstreamed soon.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">My sincere congratulations to everyone working on the awesome GNOME3, I&#8217;m sure it will be a success and make the delights of many! My faith points that GNOME3 will change Desktop user experience forever!</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Have a lot of fun&#8230;!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The openSUSE GNOME team has launched itself full throttle into preparations for openSUSE 11.4, which will be released with GNOME 2.32 as one of the desktops. Along the way, we <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GNOME_meeting_20100806">decided</a> on our focus points for the upcoming release:-</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New packages: </strong>More applications for a richer desktop experience<br />
While there are a large number of excellent GNOME/Gtk-based apps in openSUSE already, this looked like a great time to start getting more apps catering to a variety of requirements into the GNOME:Apps and GNOME:Factory build service projects. Since deciding on this, several new packages have already been worked on and are now available in the corresponding repositories. The status of new applications is tracked <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GNOME_new_packages">here</a>. Many of these applications will, subject to review, reach Factory and a few might even become part of the default openSUSE GNOME desktop.<br />
You are welcome to request the packaging of applications you have found particularly useful or impressive, and if you are in earnest, why not join us at <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#opensuse-gnome">#opensuse-gnome</a> and start packaging them for yourself? Requests for new applications may be made through comments here, on the mailing-list or at irc, but the best way to do this would be to open a feature request and tag it as &#8220;gnome-wishlist-packages&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The GNOME Pet Peeves Project: </strong>Dealing with minor irritants on the desktop<br />
I bet there have been times when you have come across a little but pesky irritant or a usability issue that left you feeling &#8220;this could have been done so much better&#8230;&#8221; We decided to track down such issues and try to have them fixed before the next release. Thus <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GNOME_Pet_Peeves_Project">the GNOME Pet Peeves Project</a>, where we note and research such issues, their workarounds and solutions. As you can see, we have located a few of these already, and started working on them.<br />
We invite you to report your pet peeve with GNOME through comments here or otherwise. Of course, the good Samaritan is more than welcome to help with the process of solving such problems as well by providing fixes, pointing to existing upstream patches or even nudging upstream developers at <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">bugzilla</a> or irc, to ensure a more polished GNOME desktop on openSUSE.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is <a href="http://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero">much to celebrate about</a>, in GNOME-land <a href="http://www.gnome.org/press/releases/2010-07-gnome-3.0-rescheduled.html">come March 2011</a>&#8230; and we hope to join the party, as well, with an (unofficial) GNOME3 take on openSUSE 11.4 to be released on the GNOME3 release day!</li>
</ul>
<p>That and more&#8230; indeed there is so much to look forward to, with the launch of 11.4, from the GNOME desktop user&#8217;s perspective. With your feedback and other contribution, you can help shape that perspective while also <em>having a lot of fun</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Space, the Final Frontier! This is the tale of one Amateur Astronomer that have found in openSUSE a terrific tool for public outreach, self-learning and teaching platform.</p>
<p>Ok, that was a bit exagerated.</p>
<p>But the truth is that I am enjoying the new SUSE Studio suite. And that&#8217;s because it is facilitating my job as an educator. I work with the Nicaraguan Amateur Astronomers Society (<a href="http://www.anasa.org.ni" target="_blank">ANASA</a>) in teaching basic astronomy to the public. Obviously, my workhorse is an openSUSE laptop, loaded with Stellarium, Celestia, KStars and Xephem (and many other tools for my personal job as an astronomer).</p>
<p><span id="more-3205"></span>For a long time, I&#8217;ve been advocating the use of openSUSE as the reliable, user-friendly and safe Linux distribution that it is, but I face a big barrier: the big majority of people attending our astronomy lessons does not have the needed technical skill and knowledge to install a new operative system, specially one like Linux.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve decided to build a Live CD using SUSE Studio, focused entirely in provide the same basic tools for learning the sky and their basic steps in Amateur Astronomy.</p>
<p>The name of the Project: AstroGarrobo</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3206" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/AstroGarrobo_UngaMan.png" alt="AstroGarrobo_UngaMan" width="286" height="251" /></p>
<p>Garrobo is the Nicaraguan name for a male Iguana. The Nicaraguan Linux community have nicknamed our openSUSE mascot as Garrobo instead of the familiar Chameleon, because a Chameleon is a rare species here in my Nation.</p>
<p>So far, there is a Beta version available for <a href="http://astrogarrobo.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">download at SourceForge</a>. I have received many valuable reports from Beta Testers from different parts o the world.</p>
<p>My goal here is to obtain a stable LiveCD, for free distribution, that may help others to obtain the tools needed to inspire, feed and motivate their love for Space.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a more detailed explanation of this project in my <a href="http://ungaman.wordpress.com/2010/01/15/astrogarrobo/" target="_blank">Blog</a> (in Spanish). I would appreciate any comments, insights and recommendations about AstroGarrobo.</p>
<p>Clear skies!</p>
