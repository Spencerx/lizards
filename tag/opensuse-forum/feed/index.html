				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a review by the openSUSE board and some significant changes in the administration, the openSUSE forums is well placed to provide sterling support to it&#8217;s users. The openSUSE forums team can be seen here: <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Forum_Team">Forum Team</a><br />
A general drawing together of all the openSUSE community (including the forums), will mean better communication over all the areas, this should translate in to improved support for the users. The forum now has language specific areas: <a href="http://forums.opensuse.org/">Forum</a><br />
And a Wiki area too. This will compliment the enormous work being done in the Wiki to improve user support. Both have their compliment of Forum specific Moderators. Here at openSUSE forum we really go the extra mile to help you.<br />
A big thank you goes out to the openSUSE board for their help over recent months. All here in the forum look forward to working along with the rest of the community.</p>
