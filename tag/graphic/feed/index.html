				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you stumble over an application that is really cool and makes your day. Of course when you tell your colleagues everyone knows it &#8211; except you, well&#8230;</p>
<p>Today I had this nice experience with a little tool called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/screenie/">screenie</a>. It helps to arrange screenshots or images in general nicely such as this example where I made boring Hermes screenshots look nice: <img src="http://en.opensuse.org/images/b/be/Screenshot_composition.png" alt="Hermes Screenshot Composition" /></p>
<p>It does it with a perfect simple interface on which you drop three images out of a file manager. A handful of options allow you to adjust the image to your needs and there you are &#8211; your little screenshot composition simply looks amazing, after a few moments of work. Great software.</p>
<p>Btw, iit&#8217;s only around 500 lines of code and a couple of resource files. Amazing, must be based on a quite powerful toolkit utilized by a real smart guy&#8230;</p>
<p>If you also want to look nice, no idea how, but for screenshots and stuff quickly install <strong>screenie </strong> from the KDE::Community repository. </p>
<p>Ah yes, I know,  you know it already, of course <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
