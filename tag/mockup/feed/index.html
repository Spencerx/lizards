				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the release of GNOME3 I would assume that people are interested in seeing how YaST2 (suggestion: rename it to YaST3 !!) is going to take form with GTK3. Of course this means eventually writing another application in GTK3, hopefully different from the old gnome-control-panel &#8216;style&#8217; which was actually pretty confusion from the user point of view as it was far too close to gnome-control-center, thus confusing new comers.</p>
<p>My suggestion (unaware if it&#8217;s possible or not) was probably to explore GNOME3 features to serve YaST integrated already with GNOME3. This could be an interesting approach as it would offer integration and some advantages:</p>
<p>* Better integration with GNOME3 without having to write(/maintain another application;<br />
* Take advantage of YaST2 modular structure;<br />
* Present YaST in a prime space in GNOME3, thus offering a openSUSE differentiation point;<br />
* No conflicts with possible KDE existing front-ends for YaST2;<br />
* Improve users experience.</p>
<p>My proposal would be something like (maybe to be served as an extension for gnome-shell). Please neglect my &#8216;lame&#8217; photo manipulation skills:</p>
