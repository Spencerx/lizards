				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you remember the June 8th 1995 ?<br />
There was a annonce here</p>
<p>http://groups.google.com/group/comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi/msg/cc7d43454d64d133</p>
<p>Announcing the Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0.</p>
<p>These tools are a set of small tight cgi binaries written in C.<br />
They perform a number of functions including:</p>
<p>. Logging accesses to your pages in your own private log files<br />
. Real-time viewing of log information<br />
. Providing a nice interface to this log information<br />
. Displaying last access information right on your pages<br />
. Full daily and total access counters<br />
. Banning access to users based on their domain<br />
. Password protecting pages based on users&#8217; domains<br />
. Tracking accesses ** based on users&#8217; e-mail addresses **<br />
. Tracking referring URL&#8217;s &#8211; HTTP_REFERER support<br />
. Performing server-side includes without needing server support for it<br />
. Ability to not log accesses from certain domains (ie. your own)<br />
. Easily create and display forms<br />
. Ability to use form information in following documents</p>
<p>Here is what you don&#8217;t need to use these tools:</p>
<p>. You do not need root access &#8211; install in your ~/public_html dir<br />
. You do not need server-side includes enabled in your server<br />
. You do not need access to Perl or Tcl or any other script interpreter<br />
. You do not need access to the httpd log files</p>
<p>The only requirement for these tools to work is that you have<br />
the ability to execute your own cgi programs.  Ask your system<br />
administrator if you are not sure what this means.</p>
<p>The tools also allow you to implement a guestbook or any other<br />
form that needs to write information and display it to users<br />
later in about 2 minutes.</p>
<p>The tools are in the public domain distributed under the GNU<br />
Public License.  Yes, that means they are free!</p>
<p>For a complete demonstration of these tools, point your browser<br />
