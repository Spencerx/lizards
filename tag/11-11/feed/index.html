<h3>Quick Résumé about 11.11</h3>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fglrx-8.911-11.11-1.png"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/fglrx-8.911-11.11-1-150x150.png" alt="fglrx direct rendering" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8227" /></a></p>

<p style="font-style:italic">
Okay, now that was a long night for me was. ￼ I&#8217;ve researched intensively since yesterday evening after the problem of GNOME 3.2 and the XvBA hardware acceleration on openSUSE 12.1. Here, a blog reader has pointed out that the direct installation of the AMD Catalyst could solve the problem. However, I think the direct installation of anything since like AMD will move the existing files, and thus endangering the integrity of files. But I had to start somewhere and so did the RPM package and direct install AMD compared. I could detect no difference in principle, except that some files were installed in a different directory, where they had really nothing to be related. I could at first make any sense why the RPM installation failed. To me a very banal story is remembered. A specific search path ld.so.conf could possibly be kicked out in openSUSE 12.1. I have my current openSUSE 11.4 /etc/ld.so.conf compared with that of openSUSE 12.1 and lo and behold some search paths were removed. I have the necessary path to /usr/X11R6/lib/ or created and /usr/X11R6/lib64 in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/fglrx.conf for the fglrx driver, and lo and behold &#8220;vainfo&#8221; tells me that everything is in order. Now comes the interesting question: Is the problem fixed with GNOME 3.2 now? The answer: YES! ￼ So, dear people, you invite the makerpm-ati-down script with the updated packaging script installs the driver as usual and have fun with the new openSUSE 12.1 and the AMD Catalyst driver.</p>
<h4>All rpms are updated now</h4>
<p>The 8.911 version are available from saturday November 19th</p>
<p>My advise is to firstly remove any existing version with zypper rm, then just zypper in the new version</p>
<p>Factory rpms are not available actually, Factory 12.2 has just change it&#8217;s version number in /etc/SuSE-release and thus is not detected for the moment.<br />
The next version should see 12.2 supported (December). Anyway you have to debug radeon on factory please!

<h3>Others things</h3>
<h4>I need you! (remember)</h4>
<p>
Even if today I already change the main ATI wiki page there will have a lot of stuff outside which contain the old server address. If you can fix them each time you saw that error, it will help any potential users to get the right informations.<br />
About the wiki, the page need also your love and contribution, look at the wiki team remark in the header. So if you feel comfortable with wiki syntax, your help in fixing <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=SDB:ATI_drivers">SDB/ATI</a> will be really appreciate.
</p>

<span style="font-size:small">(*) To know which kind of system you have, in a console look at the output of uname -a if you see x86_64 on the line you are running a 64bits, otherwise a 32bits.</span>

<h3>Installation, Caution, Troubles</h3>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Please refer to my <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=6680">previous article</a> where all the installation procedure are explained.</p>
<p>
For a first installation, if you don&#8217;t remove radeon from the initrd, you will get in trouble. Don&#8217;t thanks who removed that from the wiki. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="&#x1f641;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
</p>
<h4>Caution</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wrong (to my point of view) create an xorg.conf file which is unneeded if you work with /etc/xorg.conf.d/50-device.conf and have driver &#8220;fglrx&amp;quot inside</li>
<li>AMD CCLE didn&#8217;t get correctly upgraded if xorg is running during the upgrade my advise, go to console and as root do the following :
<pre>
init 3
rcatievenstd stop
zypper ref
zypper up
init 6
</pre>
<p>let the package rebuild the kernel driver. And for me I always remove the newly xorg.conf file created.<br />
reboot is mandatory!
</li>
</ul>
