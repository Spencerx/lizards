				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hello all, and welcome to this week&#8217;s edition of the PostgreSQL Weekly News, openSUSE-style!</strong></p>
<p>As accustomed, we&#8217;ll start with news picked from the mailing lists, then we&#8217;ll move on with news from the PostgreSQL Planet. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p>-We start off this week with Mark Hills&#8217; announcement of the release of pgnotifyd, which,  if we listen to Mark, &#8221; connects to a PostgreSQL database, listening for the named  asynchronous notification. When notification is received it executes the given command.</p>
<p>It is typically a cleaner and more efficent alternative to polling a PostgreSQL database for changes (using a crontab(5) or similar.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using it successfully to synchronise passwords and mailing lists. This is an initial release in the hope others can benefit from it.&#8221;<br />
You can find out more here : http://www.pogo.org.uk/~mark/pgnotifyd/ .</p>
<p>-Oleg Bartunov announced he posted pictures from PgCon 2010; you can watch here : http://www.flickr.com/photos/obartunov/sets/72157624042768831/ .</p>
<p>-Giuseppe Maxia announced OpenSQL camp 2010; I will try to copy the most relevant stuff from his announcement, in order not to make this article too big :<br />
&#8220;OpenSQL Camp is a free conference of, by, and for the open-source database community of users and developers. The OpenSQLCamp 2010, European Edition (http://opensqlcamp.org/) will take part in parallel to the Free and Open Source Conference 2010 (http://froscon.org/) on Saturday 21st and Sunday 22nd August in St. Augustin, Germany, which is located close to Bonn and Cologne.[&#8230;] We would like to invite your project to participate in this event.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve set up a call for participation (http://opensqlcamp.org/Events/2010/Call_for_Participation) &#8211; the deadline for submitting your proposal is July 11th.</p>
<p>We are seeking talks related to Open Source Databases of all kind, not just relational databases! Submission about tools and technologies related to OSS databases (e.g. connectors/APIs) are also welcome.</p>
<p>Some ideas and for submissions:</p>
<p>* A how to presentation, showing how to solve a common problem in the database field.<br />
* An introduction/overview about a certain database project/product or related tool<br />
* Providing &#8220;best practices&#8221; information for administrators<br />
* A deeply technical and developer-centric session about some project&#8217;s internals or an API used to connect to a database.</p>
<p>We look forward to your contribution! Please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us via IRC (#opensqlcamp on FreeNode) or our Discussion Group (http://groups.google.com/group/opensqlcamp) &#8221;</p>
<p>-Bruce Momijan announced the timetable for the release of 9.0, which would be as  follows : &#8220;Assuming we want a release Postgres 9.0 by mid-August, here is how the timetable would look:</p>
<p>Need RC release to be stable for 1-2 weeks before final<br />
RC must be released by August 1<br />
Beta must be stable for 2-3 weeks before RC<br />
Stable beta must be released by early July</p>
<p>So, we have 5-6 weeks to get a stable beta.  Looking at the open issues: http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_9.0_Open_Items#Resolved_Issues</p>
<p>it looks like we are doing OK, but we must continue progressing.&#8221;</p>
<p>-The ChronicDB release team announced version 2.2.2 ; ChronicDB is a live DB schema update system, allowing DBAs to minimize the downtime of their servers. More on their website, http://chronicdb.com/</p>
<p>-On the Planet , we have Christophe Pettus posting his slides from the Open Bridge 2010 conference, called Introduction to PostgreSQL, here : http://thebuild.com/presentations/intro-to-postgresql-osb2010.pdf.</p>
<p>-The PostgreSQL Weekly News this week offers some local events info, as well as, as usual, the submitted patches list. Check out the news here : http://www.postgresql.org/community/weeklynews/pwn20100531.</p>
<p>There you go, this was the news this week. Enjoy your weekend.</p>
