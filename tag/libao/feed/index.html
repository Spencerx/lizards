				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last time I&#8217;ve took look at <a title="Simple Direct Layer" href="http://www.libsdl.org/">Simple Direct Layer</a> and how to get audio out of it. If SDL still feels little bit too hard to cope with I think I have solutions for you: <a title="libAO" href="http://xiph.org/ao/">libAO</a>. Besides being no brainier with API libAO provides huge list of supported operating systems.<br />
There is so much audio systems supported that you won&#8217;t be dissapointed but as much as I like everyone use <a title="RoarAudio  Modern, multi-OS, networked Sound System" href="http://roaraudio.keep-cool.org/">Roaraudio</a>. I don&#8217;t see it&#8217;s happening really soon (sorry roar you had your time in fame) but supporting RoaraudioÂ  doesn&#8217;t mean that libAO is obsolete. It&#8217;s far from being obsolete. Libao supports OSS, ALSA and Pulseaudio out of the box and only problem is license is GPL 2.0+ so it&#8217;s no-go for proprietary development.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>LibAO is developed under <a title="The Xiph.Org Foundation is a non-profit corporation" href="http://xiph.org/">Xiph</a> umbrella. Xiph is the organization who brought you <a title="Vorbis audio codec" href="http://xiph.org/vorbis/">Ogg/Vorbis</a>, <a title="Flac lossless audio codec" href="http://xiph.org/flac/">FLAC</a>, <a title="Theora" href="http://theora.org/">Theora</a> and currently they are hammering together next generation video codec <a title="Daala video compression" href="http://xiph.org/daala/">Daala</a>. <a title="Opus audio codec" href="https://wiki.xiph.org/OpusFAQ">Opus</a>-audio codec standard is also Xiph project. LibAO rised from Xiph&#8217;s need multi-platform audio output library for Vorbis-audio codec. <em>In this point if you don&#8217;t have any glue what I just said in last sentences I think you should take your spoon and start shovelling about Open Source audio codecs.</em><br />
Becaus of the history libAO only has output mode and doesn&#8217;t use any callbacks. It doesn&#8217;t have fancy Float32 mode (as much as I understood) but that doesn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s bad thing. It works as expected you just feed bytes and after while you hear them from your speakers.</p>
<h2>What about API</h2>
<p><strong>Supported outputs:</strong> Alsa, Oss, Jack, Mac OS X, Windows<br />
<strong>License:</strong> GNU General Public license 2.0+</p>
<p>As said libAO API is difficult to describe since there almost <a title="LibAO docs" href="https://xiph.org/ao/doc/">ain&#8217;t NAN of it</a>. You initialize, ask output device, put in your mode settings and start feeding data. <a title="Pulseaudio simple" href="http://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/doxygen/simple.html">Pulseaudio simple</a> is almost easy as this but it&#8217;s still more difficult if you compare it to libAO. LibAO doesn&#8217;t support recording so only output and there must be a way to use another device than default but it&#8217;s not very easy to find or I was too lazy to dig it out.</p>
<p>So who wants to use libAO? People in hurry and don&#8217;t mind GPL-license, someone with very very tiny need of just getting audio out and people how hate bloat.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> So if you hate bloat and again license doesn&#8217;t make you unhappy please use this library. Still libAO has kind of same problem that ALSA has. It&#8217;s mature, usable and ready for hardcore torturing but is it sexy? No! Is fresh? No, No! Is something that will change it API every week or hour?</p>
<p>After this I have to choose what to bring next. I have FFmpeg, Gstreamer and VLC in row. If you have opinion about next framework let me know.</p>
