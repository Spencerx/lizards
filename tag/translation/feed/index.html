		<description><![CDATA[The Education project - even if currently not very present on the <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-edu/">mailinglist</a> or IRC - is very alive and actively working on many internal and external areas. The openSUSE Conference was a good place to meet some of the members and discuss many possible new topics or improvements.

I like to give a very subjective overview about the current state, so the rumors have something to eat ;-)]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even if the <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/08/15/opensuse-edu-li-f-e-11-4-update-release-announcement/">last news</a> from the Education project is just one month old, many people asked me during the openSUSE Conference why the Education project itself is currently so quiet.</p>
<p>Well, the &#8220;problem&#8221; is, that our Education team is currently more a team of technical specialists and many work is done behind the scenes without communication to &#8220;the outside&#8221;. So even if you did not hear from us for some weeks, we are still alive and coding! </p>
<p>Here are just a few examples, that are going on behind the scenes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translation of the new <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Education">openSUSE Education Portal</a> is work in progress. Many thanks to our contributors <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Guillaume_G">Guillaume</a> for the Fran√ßais, <a href="http://nl.opensuse.org/Gebruiker:Fdekruijf">Freek de Kruijf</a> for the Nederlands, <a href="http://pt.opensuse.org/Utilizador:Sabarth">Sabarth</a> for the Portugu√™s, <a href="http://ru.opensuse.org/–£—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫:Gankov">Gankov</a> for the –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian) Portal translation!</li>
<li>Kirill is currently reviewing all 425(!) packages in the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=Education">Build Service Education project</a> and submitting them to <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Factory">openSUSE Factory</a> afterwards &#8211; so openSUSE 12.1 will come with a huge set of packages directly inside the official repository.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Cyberorg">Cyberorg</a> is working on the next release of the openSUSE Edu Li-f-e DVD with the LTSP integration.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Anubisg1">Anubusg1</a> and many others (the project currently lists 44 maintainers) are doing the &#8220;normal&#8221; packaging stuff like upgrading and fixing packages for 12.1 (aka Factory)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Desktop4Education project from Austria was again present at the Conference and gave a great overview of the current status of the project during <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//contributionDisplay.py?contribId=41&amp;confId=2">their talk</a>. Good to hear that the project is being frequently used as a reference case by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Education, Arts and Culture and as such promoted by them throughout Austria.</p>
<p>Talking with Andre Massing from the <a href="http://www.simula.no/">Simula Research Laboratory</a> during <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/indico//contributionDisplay.py?contribId=108&amp;confId=2">his talk</a> at the conference was quite interesting. Looks like the Science project might see some very interesting new packages in the next months. During the discussion, we agree that the Education and the Science project can share a lot of efforts in their project setups and organization. But they will stay separated (at least in the Build Service) as their audience is very different, even if they share some packages (which is currently done via links inside the Build Service).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog does not add any information to the documentation you can find around. Anyway, it is not too long since someone was able to make Babylon dictionaries usable by software other than the proprietary Babylon application. And they have been trying for years&#8230; so it has not been a trivial step  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If you do not know Stardict, you can get it from Yast. This is <a href="http://stardict.sourceforge.net/index.php"> the official site.</a></p>
<p>A few dictionaries are also linked &#8211; ready and free to use &#8211; at Stardict website. However, I used Babylon when I was a Windows user and i have to admit that their dictionaries remain unbeaten. Matters not what language you want, mono-language or bi-language, technical, general purpose etc etc&#8230; they just rock!</p>
<p>You can get tons of dictionaries for free from <a href="http://www.babylon.com/gloss/">Babylon website</a>: </p>
<p>Now, go to Yast Software Manager and search for <strong>dictconv</strong>. Alternatively, you can install<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=146506&amp;package_id=221578"> from source </a>(which is what I personally did).</p>
<p>Installing is very easy:     <em>./configure </em> and then<em> make all install</em></p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re all set. To <strong>use</strong> it to convert:</p>
<p>cd to the directory where you have the .BGL dictionaries and type:    <strong><em>dictconv INPUT_FILENAME.BGL -o OUTPUT_FILENAME.ifo</em></strong></p>
<p>Pay attention to the extension: must be .ifo. This will generate 3 files for each BGL dictionary: .ifo, .idx, .dict</p>
<p>Place all these 3 files in /usr/share/stardict/dic/  creating a separate folder for each dictionary. Then rebook Stardict and go to Manage Dictionary (bottom right): there you can select what comes first, activate or deactivate etc etc</p>
<p>Nothing difficult but def worth, and not only for non native speakers.. there are lots of technical terminology Babylon dictionaries that may well come handy.</p>
<p>Notice that with Stardict you can also implement Pronunciations of the typed words: see <a href="http://stardict.sourceforge.net/download.php">Stardict site</a>: &#8220;WyabdcRealPeopleTTS package make StarDict pronounce English words. It is just many .wav files. Extract(tar -xjvf) the tarball at /usr/share/&#8221;.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Sooo well&#8230; Have fun ~ Buon divertimento ~ Viel Spa√ü ~ I que te diviertas ~ Maak plezier ~ ha s√• roligt [hmm i&#8217;m just hoping the dictionaries mentioned just above are not making me do some poor figure for these few transations of &#8220;Have Fun&#8221;.. cuz i have no idea for any language except Italian :D]</p>
