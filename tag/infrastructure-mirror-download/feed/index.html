				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, it <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2009-07/msg00014.html">became evident</a> that users in India don&#8217;t get good mirrors. This was <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2009-07/msg00015.html">solved</a> by configuring a few German and US mirrors to serve users from India.</p>
<p>Courtesy of <a class="reference" href="http://lisas.de/%7Eadrian/">Adrian Reber</a> from Esslingen University of Applied Sciences, there is an illustrative screenshot that visualizes the efficacy of this. The world map shows accesses to <a class="reference" href="http://ftp-stud.hs-esslingen.de/info/index.php4">their openSUSE mirror</a> by country (<a class="reference" href="http://ftp-stud.hs-esslingen.de/info/breakdown.php4?details=opensuse">live view</a>). In openSUSE&#8217;s <a href="http://mirrorbrain.org/">MirrorBrain</a> configuration, this mirror is set up to receive German, Danish, Polish, and Indian requests.</p>
<p>The background is that India has bad connectivity to neighbouring countries, but good connection to German and US mirrors. Therefore, now a few German and US mirrors are configured to serve India. The screenshot below demonstrates this for the <a href="http://ftp-stud.fht-esslingen.de/pub/Mirrors/ftp.opensuse.org/">mirror of the Esslingen University of Applied Sciences</a>:</p>
<div style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://mirrorbrain.org/static/images/screenshots/india_sent_to_german_mirrors.gif" alt="world map showing client distribution of accesses to an openSUSE mirror in Germany" width="800" height="425" /><p class="wp-caption-text">world map showing client distribution of accesses to an openSUSE mirror in Germany</p></div>
<p>The world map clearly shows how the mirror gets nearly exclusively German requests, as well as those from India. The same happens for some other German and some US mirrors.</p>
<p>Note that if a mirror in India should become available (would be nice!), it would automatically be preferred, and the other mirrors become fallback mirrors.</p>
<p>While it is not new that we do this, the screenshot of Adrian&#8217;s analysis illustrates the issue very nicely. We have similar configuration for a number of countries, where a mirror selection purely based on countries and regions wouldn&#8217;t work. For this kind of tuning, we depend on user input.</p>
<p>Hints about how to improve serving our downloads are always appreciated. Please write to admin at opensuse dot org with input in this regard. Thanks!</p>
