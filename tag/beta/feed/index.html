				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Yippee Yeah Another Proprietary AMD/ATI Catalyst fglrx 13.11 BETA v9.4 (13.25.18-2) rpm are released for any openSUSE version</h2>
<p><img src="http://support.amd.com/Style%20Library/Images/logo.png" alt="amd logo" style="float:right" /></p>
<p>Welcome in paradise II &#8230; <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
<br />A fresh new version of the FGLRX driver has been released by AMD, and thus packaged and available for all of you.<br />
<br />Next month, AMD promise to release a stable version.
</p>
<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above. All owner of HD2xx and HD4xx are really encouraged to use the free radeon driver (which received a lot of improvement in 3.11)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s 13 and thirteen <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  When I speak about 13.1 it&#8217;s openSUSE version, 13.11 is FGLRX version, don&#8217;t get confused! Oh and 3.11 is the kernel version <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>This is experimental &amp; BETA software, it could fix issues you encountered (FGLRX not working for openSUSE 13.1),<br />
But good reports have been collected around (people having used Sebastian&#8217;s script directly)
</p>
<p>I would like to thanks again Sebastian Siebert for his effort to kept FGLRX in a good shape for all of us.</p>
<h2>Beta Repository</h2>
<p>To make things clear about the status of the drivers, it will not be published under the normal stable repository http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx.<br />
I&#8217;ve created some times ago a beta repository located at <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta">http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta</a>.<br />
The FGLRX 13.11 beta6 and beta 9.4 rpm are released for any openSUSE version from 11.4(Evergreen) to latest 13.1 + Tumbleweed<br />
<br />
Also the signer of package have change and use now the generic builder gpg key at Ioda-Net. (gpg key id 65BE584C)
</p>
<h3>Installing the new repository</h3>
<p>Admitting you&#8217;ve the normal repository named FGLRX, (use zypper lr -d to find the number or name you give it). You have to start by disabling it<br />
so you could fallback to it quickly when new stable version will be published. Open a root console or add sudo at your convenience and issue the following command:</p>
<pre>zypper mr -dR FGLRX</pre>
<p><a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fgrlx-beta/">amd-fglrx-beta</a></p>
<p>To add another repository in the same console as root issue the following command which will install normally the right repository for your distribution</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_`lsb-release -r | awk '{print $2}'` FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p><b>If you are using Tumbleweed</b> use this one</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_Tumbleweed FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Now the update/upgrade process</p>
<pre>zypper dup -r FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Let the system upgrade the package, and try to enjoy the new beta.</p>
<p><span id="more-10174"></span></p>
<h3>Upgrading from the previous beta</h3>
<p>Let the magic of zypper do the work for you</p>
<pre>zypper lu</pre>
<p> will show you the new build -2</p>
<pre>zypper up</pre>
<p> will update to the new version</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Only for the brave, Proprietary AMD/ATI Catalyst fglrx 13.10 BETA2 (13.20.11-1) rpm released</h1>
<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above. And adventurous users who know how to deal with troubles.<br />
The majority could easily wait the final release, expected somewhat later even if it take a long time <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />
</p>
<p>This is experimental &amp; BETA software, it could fix issues you encountered, but also can eat your kittens. You&#8217;ve been warned !<br />
flgrx build for 3.11 series kernel ( Tumbleweed &amp; 13.1 ).<br />
But this time I&#8217;ve to update the Sebastian script myself, so I consider also the package as beta stage.
</p>
<h3>Installing the new repository</h3>
<p>Admitting you&#8217;ve the normal repository named FGLRX, (use zypper lr -d to find the number or name you give it). You have to start by disabling it<br />
so you could fallback to it quickly. Open a root console or add sudo at your convenience and issue the following command:</p>
<pre>zypper mr -dR FGLRX</pre>
<p>The beta driver is available for 11.4 (evergreen kernel), 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 13.1, Tumbleweed (12.3 based + kernel 3.11) at <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fgrlx-beta/">amd-fglrx-beta</a></p>
<p>To add another repository in the same console as root issue the following command which will install normally the right repository for your distribution</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_`lsb-release -r | awk '{print $2}'` FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p><b>If you are using Tumbleweed</b> use this one</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_Tumbleweed FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Now the update/upgrade process</p>
<pre>zypper dup -r FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Let the system upgrade the package, and try to enjoy the new beta</p>

But good reports have been collected around, especially with never 3.10x kernel series.

<h3>Installing the new repository</h3>
<p>Admitting you&#8217;ve the normal repository named FGLRX, (use zypper lr -d to find the number or name you give it). You have to start by disabling it, so you could fallback to it quickly. Open a root console or add sudo at your convenience and issue the following command:</p>
<pre>zypper mr -dR FGLRX</pre>
<p>The beta driver is available for 11.4 (evergreen kernel), 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 13.1, Tumbleweed (12.3 based + kernel 3.10) at <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/amd-fgrlx-beta/">amd-fglrx-beta</a></p>
<p>To add another repository in the same console as root issue the following command which will install normally the right repository for your distribution</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_`lsb-release -r | awk '{print $2}'` FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p><b>If you are using Tumbleweed</b> use this one</p>
<pre>zypper ar -n FGLRX-BETA -cgf http://geeko.ioda.net/amd-fglrx-beta/openSUSE_Tumbleweed FGLRX-BETA</pre>
<p>Now the update/upgrade process</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://kraft.sourceforge.net/index.php?body=&amp;lang=en">Kraft</a> team is happy to announce the first beta version of Kraft version 0.40. This is the first version of Kraft based on the KDE 4 platform. It is the result of a very long porting effort but has now reached a state where we can, after a short beta cycle, release a  stable version of Kraft for KDE 4. It will be nearly feature equal to version <a href="http://kraft.sourceforge.net/index.php?body=releasenotes&amp;lang=en">0.32 for KDE 3</a>.</p>
<p>One of the new features of Kraft 0.40 makes the setup of Kraft easier. The file based sqlite database was added in addition to the mysql backend, so for evaluation no database server setup work is required any more. Furthermore a setup wizard that guides new users through the setup process aims to make it easier for new and unexperienced users.</p>
<p>Please help us by testing the beta version and report bugs back to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=kraft-user">Kraft user mailinglist</a>. The sources can be downloaded from the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/kraft/files/">Sourceforge project page</a>. Binary packages for openSUSE 11.1, openSUSE 11.2 and (K)Ubuntu 9.10 are available from the <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/kfreitag:/Kraft:/Beta/">Kraft Beta repository</a> from the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service">openSUSE Buildservice</a>, see <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Add_package_repositories">here</a> how to add and use it.</p>
