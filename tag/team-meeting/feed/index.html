				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been far too long since the GNOME Team actually put their heads together and talked about what is going on in the garden.  As such regular meetings are re-starting, but with a slight difference &#8211; it will be monthly on the 3rd Tuesday of each month at 1400UTC, for localised times please see <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=18&amp;month=5&amp;year=2010&amp;hour=14&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=0">here</a>.</p>
<p>That means the next meeting will be held this Tuesday, 18th May 2010, in the garden (otherwise known as <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-gnome">#opensuse-gnome</a> on Freenode).  The Agenda is pretty simple and can be added to on the <a href="http://http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME/Meetings/20100518">wiki</a>.  For those curious it will kind of follow the lines of:</p>
<p>1. openSUSE GNOME Status<br />
  1.1 Packaging<br />
  1.2 Bugs<br />
  1.3 Q &amp; A<br />
2. Upstream GNOME Status<br />
  2.1 What&#8217;s New<br />
  2.2 Bugs<br />
  2.3 Q &amp; A<br />
3. General Q &amp; A</p>
<p>So please come buy the garden, pull up a chair and crack a cold one open.  Join in the fun and add anything you need to the agenda.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yet again the guardians of the garden are boogieing.</p>
<p>The <a title="openSUSE GNOME" href="http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME">GNOME Team</a> are holding their meeting tomorrow Thursday 22nd May at 1600GMT/UTC/ZULU (or <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=5&amp;day=22&amp;year=2008&amp;hour=16&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=0">translate</a> it into your local time).  As always you can get sight of the <a title="openSUSE GNOME meeting page" href="http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME/Meetings/">agenda</a>; the main themes for this week are Factory Testing, Bugs &#8211; under prioritised/bug voting/10.3 bug squashing, and a new item to the show Community Clinic.</p>
<p>&#8220;What pray tell is that last item?&#8221; I hear you ask (you did ask didn&#8217;t you?).  It is an item aimed at the code contributing challenged.  Basically we hope to be able to provide means for those that are unable to hack (for whatever reason) a way of helping out.  This could be packaging, documentation, pimping our wares and even <a title="High Altitude Low Opening" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HALO/HAHO">HALO</a> insertions behind enemy lines for guerrilla hit and run attacks.  Okay maybe not the last item but you get the idea.</p>
<p>So please come along and join the party, you don&#8217;t have to <a title="Bring Your Own Beer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byob">BYOB</a> but the more the merrier we become <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="&#x1f600;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
