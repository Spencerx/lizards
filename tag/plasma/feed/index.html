				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last seven days we were hosting the KDE Plasma Team doing their developer meeting called Tokamak4 here in at the Nuremberg offices of Novell. It was great for SUSE to see the twentyfife KDE enthusiasts hacking on one of the most important parts of the KDE software compilation.</p>
<p>On monday we had the pleasure of a public event with four highly interesting talks given by the Plasmas in our allhands area in Maxtorhof. Will Stephenson was sheding some light on the old days where SuSE already was  hosting a sprint for KDE. I guess in that days we still called it &#8220;developer meeting&#8221;, but it was basically the same concept. It happened in an office building called Schanz which was still SuSEs but not in use these days. Will had some cool photos of well known KDE developers, partly with  more hair and less bally than nowadays, hacking on KDE3. I think the meeting was in 2003, so it is great to see how many people are still around in the community.For me that was the first KDE meeting I participated, working on my scan application called Kooka. Fun.</p>
<p>After that Aaron Seigo was talking about <a href="http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Plasma">Plasma</a> as a cross device and cross form factor concept, Marco Martin was presenting very interesting stuff about <a href="http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Plasma/Plasma-Netbook">KDEs Netbook shell</a> and finally Sebastian KÃ¼gler was introducing <a href="http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Silk">Silk</a>, the project to free the web from the browser. It was a very inspiring evening which closed with good discussion over some drinks. I like to thank the KDE guys for giving the presentations and our guests for showing up. </p>
<p>The rest of the week was full of concentrated work for the Plasmas, watch out on <a href="http://planetkde.org">planetkde</a> for various posts. </p>
<p>From the openSUSE perspective it was a pleasure to host the meeting, it was very nice to meet you all again. Thank you all for being our guests. It was fun and as a result we really want to continue the idea. </p>
<p>openSUSE is upstreams friend and we are convinced that  personal meetings are the most effective way to make progress. So if your community is watching out for a place to meet, innovate and hack, let us know, I am sure we can arrange something.</p>
