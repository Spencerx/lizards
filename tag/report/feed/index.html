<p>The 8th Free and Open Source Software Communities Meeting (<a href="http://fosscomm.teiath.gr/" target="_blank">FOSSCOMM</a>) took place in Athens (Greece), November 6-8th 2015 at the <a href="http://www.teiath.gr/articles.php?id=98&amp;lang=el" target="_blank">Technical Educational Institute of Athens</a>.</p>
<p>The Conference started early on Saturday morning welcoming the participants and with the key note. Various presentations about open source software, hardware constructions and some workshops took place. Presentations such as Raspberry Pi arcade, openstack, OSGeo, ownCloud, Bitcoin and many more were quite interested by the visitors.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0716" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/eiosifidis/22316436533/in/album-72157660299594107/"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/670/22316436533_ee99406122_n.jpg" alt="DSC_0716" width="320" height="213" /></a></p>
<p>Greek openSUSE community was there with a booth and some presentations. On Saturday Alex P. Natsios presented “Enlightment on openSUSE”, an alternative GUI, and the other presentation was about “openQA”. Since openSUSE Leap 42.1 was very fresh, Alexandros Vennos took the opportunity to present what are openSUSE Leap 42.1 and Tumbleweed, the differences and what to install on what occasions. Presentation had title “openSUSE – Leaping Ahead”.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0709" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/eiosifidis/22911595656/in/album-72157660299594107/"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5644/22911595656_3e32100290_n.jpg" alt="DSC_0709" width="320" height="213" /></a></p>
<p>The booth was quite crowded. We had some left over DVDs of 13.2 but we proposed the visitors to install Leap 42.1. The question we were asked most was what is the difference between openSUSE Leap and Tubleweed and why to install and on what ocasion. We even created couple of bootable USBs from the ISOs of Leap. We had a Banana Pi running Tumbleweed with MATE playing a video loop of openSUSE Leap 42.1 KDE review. We gave almost all of our promo materials to the visitors since they were interested on openSUSE.</p>
