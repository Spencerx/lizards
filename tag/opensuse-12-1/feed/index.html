				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b> Important </b><br />
If you&#8217;re still using openSUSE 12.1 and you have one day installed the AMD/ATI FGLRX long time ago, you certainly forget to adjust the new location of the repository.</p>
<p>My server indicate that still around 154 Geekos have their FGLRX repository pointing to the old urls :<br />
http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/ati/openSUSE_12.1/</p>
<p>The location changed long time ago, when AMD decide to split the drivers in two part (legacy HD2xxx-HD4xxx and normal HD5xxx or above).<br />
The worst things, is that those are trying to refresh almost every half hour, generating 404 errors on my server, without help them to get the right driver.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a call at that time to help to spread the information. Would be nice, if any of you could spread this reminder to your fellows.<br />
Cause I can decide by a redirection, which gpu you have <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The new location for 12.1 was setup as following :<br />
For HD2xxx-HD4xxxx legacy :<a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-legacy/openSUSE_12.1">http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx-legacy/openSUSE_12.1/</a></p>
<p>For HD5xxx or above : <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx/openSUSE_12.1/">http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx/openSUSE_12.1/</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">I was Inspired by the time  in a remote area, which is absolutely no internet connection, but I have problem when trying to share the DVD installer openSUSE 12.1 to Students and teachers at the vocational school, because the default openSUSE 12.1  distribution does not include Audio &amp; Video codec, the issue of License GPL (General Public License) that embraced by the openSUSE distro. I try to make openSUSE Multimedia is ready for use by the user without having to depend on internet connection because they have to install Codecs Audio &amp; Video.<br />
Nothing is different the official openSUSE 12.1 with openSUSE Multimedia, I just added some applications that do not exist in the original distribution of openSUSE and add <a href="http://opensuse-community.org/Restricted_formats" target="_blank">Restricted_formats</a>  codec, in addition to applications and libraries that were included are up to date of http://download.opensuse.org/update/12.1/.</p>
<p>openSUSE 12.1 Multimedia 32-bit Base on openSUSE  12.1, using the default desktop  Gnome  3 sprinkled with cinnamon.<br />
openSUSE 12.1 Multimedia  built using susestudio.com, and are designed to be ready to use for users who want to feel the openSUSE but trouble Internet connection, because they have to install codecs mp3, mp4, wmv and some other restricted format http://opensuse-community.org/Restricted_formats.</p>
<p>As for some of the packages included in it are:</p>
<p>A. LibreOffice<br />
2. banshe<br />
3. Amarok<br />
4. Brasero<br />
5. Cheese<br />
6. Empathy<br />
7. Xchat<br />
8. flash-player<br />
9. Gmplayer<br />
10.Gimp<br />
11.Imagewriter<br />
12.k3b<br />
13.Smplayer<br />
14.etc &#8230;</p>
<p>If you want to use it please download via http://susestudio.com/a/haHwG8/opensuse-multimedia</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A long awaited feature of the openSUSE update stack is finally here!<br />
Since some time, it has been possible to tell libzypp to not delete old<br />
kernels on update:</p>
<pre>multiversion = provides:multiversion(kernel)</pre>
<p>in <tt>/etc/zypp/zypp.conf</tt>. That way, you don&#8217;t have to worry that a<br />
brand new -rc kernel from Factory makes your system unbootable.  This however<br />
solves one problem and brings another one &#8211; you have to manually delete the<br />
old kernel so that your /boot partition does not fill up. openSUSE 12.1 will<br />
provide a solution to this, you will be able to tell what kernels you want to<br />
keep after an update, other kernels will be deleted. The configuration is the<br />
same file, <tt>/etc/zypp/zypp.conf</tt>:</p>
<pre>## Comma separated list of kernel packages to keep installed in parallel, if the
## above multiversion variable is set. Packages can be specified as
## 2.6.32.12-0.7 - Exact version to keep
## latest        - Keep kernel with the highest version number
## latest-N      - Keep kernel with the Nth highest version number
## running       - Keep the running kernel
## oldest        - Keep kernel with the lowest version number (the GA kernel)
## oldest+N      - Keep kernel with the Nth lowest version number
##
## Default: Do not delete any kernels if multiversion = provides:multiversion(kernel) is set
multiversion.kernels = latest,running
</pre>
<p>If you configure this and the above multiversion variable, then after each<br />
kernel update, during a subsequent reboot, a script will compare the list of<br />
installed kernels with the multiversion.kernels setting and delete those that<br />
are no longer needed. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li> Keep the latest kernel and the running one if it differs. This is similar to<br />
no enabling the multiversion feature at all, except that the old kernel is<br />
removed after reboot and not immediatelly after installation.  BTW, you<br />
probably always want to include &#8220;running&#8221;:</p>
<pre>multiversion.kernels = latest,running</pre>
</li>
<li>Keep last two kernels and the running one:
<pre>multiversion.kernels = latest,latest-1,running</pre>
</li>
<li>Keep the latest kernel, the running and a my test kernel with a fancy<br />
patch:</p>
<pre>multiversion.kernels = latest,running,3.0.rc7-test</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to try it, it&#8217;s all in Factory already. Check if these packages are<br />
recent enough and uncomment the two variables in zypp.conf:</p>
<pre>$ rpm -q --changelog kernel-desktop mkinitrd libzypp | grep -B2 312018
* Fri Jun 17 2011 mmarek@suse.cz
- rpm/post.sh: Touch /boot/do_purge_kernels on package install
    (fate#312018).
--
- Add purge-kernels script to automatically delete old kernel packages
  on boot, based on configuration in /etc/zypp/zypp.conf, variable
  multiversion_kernels (fate#312018).
--
* Tue Jun 21 2011 dmacvicar@suse.de
- Add configuration template for automatic kernel
  purge (feature#312018) to zypp.conf
$ grep ^multiversion /etc/zypp/zypp.conf
multiversion = provides:multiversion(kernel)
multiversion.kernels = latest,running
</pre>
<p>Happy updating!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week saw the <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/06/01/first-step-towards-12-1-with-milestone-1/" target="_blank">release</a> of the first milestone of openSUSE 12.1 and work on factory is continuing, I&#8217;ve found the following changes important:</p>
<h3>GNU C Library (glibc) 2.13</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve updated glibc from version 2.11 to 2.13 which brings many bug fixes and AFAIK no major breakages to packages. The package itself got cleaned up a little bit as well, so please report any problems.</p>
<h3>GO Programming Language</h3>
<p>Factory now contains a compiler for the GO language which is &#8220;is an expressive, concurrent, garbage collected systems programming  language that is type safe and memory safe.&#8221;. More details about GO are available on the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_Go " target="_blank">openSUSE Wiki</a>, the devel project with additional packages is <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=devel%3Alanguages%3Ago" target="_blank">devel:languages:go</a>.</p>
<h3>Packaging: Source Processing</h3>
<p>The usage of <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2011-05/msg00037.html" target="_blank">_service</a> files in Factory confused many packagers and resulted in broken packages so that these will be deprecated. As a replacement, Adrian implemented now a new <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2011-05/msg00359.html" target="_blank">source processing method and asks for testers</a>.</p>
<h3>Packaging: Adding useful Provides to cups drivers</h3>
<p>Vincent &#8220;updated python-cups to a new version, and it is now shipping<br />
files to automatically add Provides tag to packages that are shipping<br />
cups drivers.&#8221;. This allows desktop packages to install the right printer driver &#8211; or users to do it via zypper. Packages with <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-packaging/2011-05/msg00158.html" target="_blank">cups drivers just need to add</a> a &#8220;BuildRequires: python-cups&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Open Build Service Improvement</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/home/my_work" target="_blank">&#8220;My Work&#8221;</a> view has been updated to better show packages that are in review state and need your review. I suggest everybody to check out the page and cleanup your list.</p>
<h3>Multiple Buildroots with osc</h3>
<p>If you like to use more than one build at the same time, there are several options like pointed out on the <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-packaging/2011-06/msg00010.html" target="_blank">opensuse-packaging mailing list</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of the environment variable OSC_BUILD_ROOT to define a build root.</li>
<li>Editing of the osc config file ~/.oscrc and setting build-root to contain the variables %(repo), %(arch),  %(project) or %(package).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Correction on auto-legal build service check</h3>
<p>Jürgen corrected my <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/05/27/factory-progress/" target="_blank">report</a> from last week: He would love to see the checks for auto-legal moved and welcomes any help.</p>
<h3>Thanks</h3>
<p>Thanks for the words of encouragement to my first blog post. I&#8217;ll try to continue this series. If there&#8217;s anything you think should be added to it, please contact me via email at aj at opensuse dot org.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of things are happening in our Factory distribution that will be released in November 2011 as openSUSE 12.1 and I&#8217;d like to point out a few things from the last few weeks that users and developers of factory shouldn&#8217;t miss.</p>
<h3>Roadmap openSUSE 12.1</h3>
<p>Stephan &#8220;Coolo&#8221; Kulow has updated the openSUSE 12.1 <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Roadmap" target="_blank">Roadmap</a>, the next milestone is Milestone 1 which is delayed and targeted now for release on Tuesday, 30th May. The next paragraphs highlight some of the updates for this versions.</p>
<h4>GCC 4.6</h4>
<p>The GNU Compiler Collection has been updated to version 4.6, the list of  <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.6/changes.html" target="_self">changes</a> includes the following new warning that will be visible while compiling packages for openSUSE Factory:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;New <code>-Wunused-but-set-variable</code> and     <code>-Wunused-but-set-parameter</code> warnings were added     for C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++.     These warnings diagnose variables respective parameters which     are only set in the code and never otherwise used.     Usually such variables are useless and often even the value     assigned to them is computed needlessly, sometimes expensively.     The <code>-Wunused-but-set-variable</code> warning is enabled by     default by <code>-Wall</code> flag and <code>-Wunused-but-set-parameter</code> by <code>-Wall -Wextra</code> flags.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Some packages have been failing by the new GCC due to new warnings and new optimizations and most have been fixed already but please double check that your packages are building and running fine.</p>
<h4>RPM 4.9</h4>
<p>Michael Schröder <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-packaging/2011-05/msg00112.html" target="_blank">announced</a> <a href="http://rpm.org/wiki/Releases/4.9.0" target="_blank">RPM 4.9</a> for Factory. He explains the main packager visible changes as:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Besides some bug fixes and an update to a newer BerkeleyDB<br />
library rpm-4.9.0 contains plugin architecture for dependency<br />
generation. In older rpms, the internal dependency generator<br />
was pretty much hardcoded in C, so we always used the old<br />
external one to generate dependencies. With rpm-4.9.0, the<br />
internal generator has become flexible enough so that we<br />
can use it.</p>
<p>This means for you, that rpm will no longer use the %__find_provides and %__find_requires macros. Some packages redefined those macros to be able to filter the generated dependencies.<br />
This will no longer work in rpm-4.9.0. Instead, support for<br />
dependency filtering was added to rpm&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h4>GNOME 3</h4>
<p><a href="http://gnome3.org" target="_blank">GNOME 3</a> has now hit Factory as well and Vincent Untz <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-packaging/2011-05/msg00006.html" target="_blank">explained</a> how to fix failures due to the large push.</p>
<h4>Linux Kernel 2.6.39</h4>
<p>This update was a &#8220;boring&#8221; update &#8211; nothing broke AFAIK ;), so I hope it&#8217;s a solid version. Users will benefit from the<a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Linux-Kernel-2-6-39-Tracking-1219728.html" target="_blank"> new features</a> in it. 2.6.39 is the first kernel without the Big Kernel Lock at all!</p>
<h3>Packaging Changes</h3>
<p>Besides new software, also new ways of handling it get introduced. The following catched my eyes:</p>
<h3>Rpmlint update</h3>
<p>Ludwig Nussel updated rpmlint to version 1.2 and <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-packaging/2011-05/msg00118.html" target="_blank">explained</a> the new warnings about packaging of rpm packages &#8211; and what to do about them.</p>
<h3>Changing the process of Factory submissions with the Open Build Service</h3>
<p>Now with every submission to Factory scripts are run automatically that do two different reviews before the package goes to human check-in review:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &#8220;legal-auto&#8221; review checks the updated package for changes in licenses.</li>
<li>The &#8220;factory-auto&#8221; review checks that the updated package builds actually in the devel project &#8211; and if not, rejects it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The &#8220;legal-auto&#8221; review has quite a long backlog at the moment and Jürgen is working on moving some of the checks to rpmlint or osc checks &#8211; so that the packager notices and fixes them before submission to Factory.</p>
<p>Also, you can now submit packages to Factory even if you are not the maintainer of the package but in this case the maintainer (packager) gets a review request to review that the package really can go to factory and thus a plea to packagers to handle their review requests.</p>
<h3>openSUSE Conference</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/opensuse-conference-2011-to-be-creative-and-open/" target="_blank">openSUSE Conference</a> is this year co-located with the SUSE Labs conference. Join us to present and discuss also Factory related topics. The <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2011/05/16/opensuse-conference-2011-to-be-creative-and-open/" target="_self">Call for papers</a> is open now!</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m interested on feedback on this article &#8211; should I start a series?</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The voting on how to do the versioning is over and the &#8220;old school&#8221; has won by 55 per cent (of 98 participants). Thanks to all that participated in the two votes and the discussion around the topic.</p>
<p>As Coolo said in on the <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2011-03/msg00516.html" target="_self">project list</a>,  we&#8217;d like to make a small change to the numbering:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We will not have a .0 release but only .1, .2, .3 release. Since we have releases in three months, the November<br />
release is always the .1 release, the July release the .2 and the March release the .3.</p>
<p>So, the plan is that the next release will be called openSUSE 12.1 and launched on the 10th of November, 2011! Two years later &#8211; on the 14th of November, 2013 &#8211; we will then have the openSUSE 13.1 release.</p>
<p>So, the next four releases are called:</p>
<ul>
<li> November 2011: openSUSE 12.1</li>
<li> July 2012: openSUSE 12.2</li>
<li> March 2013: openSUSE 12.3</li>
<li> November 2013: openSUSE 13.1</li>
</ul>
<p>Detailed results for logged-in openSUSE members are available at the <a href="https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/polls/read/a_jaeger/12979/opensuse-release-versioning" target="_blank">connect poll page</a> and I have reproduced them here as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: &#8220;old school&#8221;: Like currently but only counting the right number until 3:<br />
55% (54 votes)</li>
<li>B: &#8220;Fedora style&#8221;: Just integers:<br />
29 % (28 votes)</li>
<li>C: &#8220;Ubuntu style&#8221;: YY.MM:<br />
16 % (16 votes)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also consistent with the <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2011/03/28/opensuse-release-versioning-poll-on-last-three-options/" target="_blank">results of the first public voting</a>.</p>
<p><!-- p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; } -->Note that openSUSE does not have a major and minor numbering, even if it seems so. There is right now no difference in any way between what we would do for openSUSE 11.4 or 12.0 or 12.1 – and no sense to speak about openSUSE 11 or openSUSE 11 family. We also had in the past no process on how to name the next release (when to increase which parts of the number).</p>
<p>I think this new versioning is still consistent with the old one but also an improvement since it&#8217;s now clear that we change the first digit every two year. The first poll showed that half of our users prefer a date based versioning and the other a consecutive numbering. So, depending on your point of view, you can see this as a mixture of both or as consecutive numbering <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So, time now to make openSUSE 12.1 a great release!</p>
