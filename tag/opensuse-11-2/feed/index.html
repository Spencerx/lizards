Several Linux Distros like Ubuntu, CAELinux, Fedora, Gentoo, Debian, openSUSE and organizations like CIDETYS and business like ELCONIX did make presence and their users and members gave a Talk for students, academics, users and professionals. Those Talks were transmited simultaneously by video streaming to the Laureate Universities Network to promote opensource software contributions, trainings, certifications and community participation, job opportunities.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The openSUSE Project is pleased to announce the release of openSUSE 11.2. After a couple of month good work towards the 11.2 we&#8217;re enjoying a very nice distribution which I already like very much. It is running on most of my machines for a few weeks now. I have already seen some SUSE Linux distros going gold over the time I spent with SUSE and my personal gut feeling tells me this is one of the more remarkable versions.</p>
<p>As usual it comes with tons of new up to date software and also the installation runs smoothly, please read the <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2009/11/12/opensuse-11-2-released/">announcement</a> for all the details,  but what for me the most remarkable with 11.2 is that  it is a real community openSUSE distro.</p>
<p>There is so much effort visible in 11.2 which was achieved through our growing community rather than just the SUSE people. We had a lots of requests in openFATE suggesting features, we discussed some of them quite heated, others were no-brainer. We again had lots of testers who hammered the alphas and betas and reported big and small bugs. On the openSUSE Conference many discussions about the upcoming distribution took place which were inspiring. We were able to utilize the powerful openSUSE Buildservice to build the distro together with all packagers very effectively. That improved the quality of our packages again. Another very visible thing for me personally is the desktop artwork which was done in best cooperation with upstream &#8211; and it looks so great that I hesitate to start applications which cover the desktop all day <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>It is really exciting to see how things come together on the way to community distribution, and how far we got with openSUSE 11.2. I am happy about that and I am proud to be part of this and like to say <strong>thank you</strong> for every little bit you might have contributed. I believe that the message that openSUSE is your community distribution has arrived.</p>
<p>Of course openSUSE continues to be open for your ideas, the distribution can be the vehicle to power up ideas from a little application to huge software projects. The openSUSE project is the powerful community behind which helps to make ideas reality. And all that based on the principles of free software! I am really happy today and very excited about what future will bring <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
<p>I hope to see you on the release event here in Nürnberg soon <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that 11.2 gets closer and closer to the rc status being able to play mp3 becomes important in order to make the testing experience even nicer.</p>
<p>Here is my workaround to get that mp3 working in amarok. I do not know about the dvd&#8217;s as the only one that I own is to boring to use it for testing purposes</p>
<p>wget http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.1/repo/oss/suse/x86_64/libcdio7-0.80-5.30.x86_64.rpm<br />
zypper in file:&lt;Path-to&gt;libcdio7-0.80-5.30.x86_64.rpm<br />
wget http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.1/repo/oss/suse/x86_64/libiso9660-5-0.80-5.30.x86_64.rpm<br />
zypper in file:&lt;Path-to&gt;libiso9660-5-0.80-5.30.x86_64.rpm<br />
wget http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.1/repo/oss/suse/x86_64/libMagickCore1-6.4.3.6-5.3.x86_64.rpm<br />
zypper in file:&lt;Path-to&gt;libMagickCore1-6.4.3.6-5.3.x86_64.rpm<br />
wget http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.1/repo/oss/suse/x86_64/libMagickWand1-6.4.3.6-5.3.x86_64.rpm<br />
zypper in file:&lt;Path-to&gt;libMagickWand1-6.4.3.6-5.3.x86_64.rpm<br />
zypper in libxine1-codecs</p>
<p>So as you can see I just use the missing libs from 11.1.Of course I assumed that you added the 11.1 packman to your repos already.</p>
