				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Day 3 started off relatively early in comparison to day 2, why? Because I was continuing my <em>ChatWeek</em> with a fairly important chat with a fairly influential person.  The person in question was non other than <a title="Jeff Jaffe's Bio" href="http://www.novell.com/company/bios/jjaffe.html">Jeff Jaffe</a>, <a title="Jeff Jaffe's Blog" href="http://www.novell.com/ctoblog/">Novell&#8217;s CTO</a>.  Fellow Community member <a title="yaloki - the openSUSE jack of all trades" href="http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/">Pascal Blesser</a> and myself were invited to have a relaxed discussion with Jeff about openSUSE and Novell and bring up any issues/comments/etc that we may know of.  We spoke with <a title="AJ, openSUSE Board Chairman" href="http://andreasjaeger.blogspot.com/">Andreas Jaeger</a> and Michael Loeffler yesterday about the impending meeting, and discussed at some length some of the items not just because we hoped to bring them up with Jeff, but because we felt they warranted discussion regardless of who it was in front of.</p>
<p>The meeting with Jeff went well, and we appreciate the opportunity immensely to be able to speak fairly frankly to Jeff (no, neither of us swore or threw any furniture in the style of a Rock Star).  We didn&#8217;t manage to go through <em>all</em> the points we would have liked, but we certainly got through the big burning issues that we had.  After almost 90 minutes Jeff had to leave and do the rounds to see how HackWeek was progressing from the &#8220;shop floor&#8221;.  This meeting wasn&#8217;t a marketing blah blah meeting but a definite participation on all sides; there were times when disagreement happened but as the atmosphere was relaxed it was pretty easy to move on.</p>
<p>Afterwards I tried (relatively unsuccessfully) to get on with my project and edit the footage from the previous day.  Why oh why is video editing not simple?  Either applications are just way way way too difficult or just unbelievably unstable to the point of uselessness.  Hopefully tomorrow will be more successful when I pressgang <a title="digitalthom's blog" href="http://www.digitalflow.de/index.php?seite=blog">Thomas Schmidt</a> into helping me <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>For </strong><strong>ALL participants of HackWeek</strong>: <a title="Linux focused Podcast and Blogcast" href="http://sudowrestling.com">SudoWrestling</a>, a great Linux focused podcast and blogcast (sometimes they can&#8217;t be bothered to talk, strange considering they&#8217;re women <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) would really like to <a title="Contact SudoWrestling about HackWeek" href="http://sudowrestling.com/2008/08/27/sudo-wrestling-nonpodcast-hackweek-opensuse-build-service-maked-windows-a-package-didnt-eated-it.aspx">hear</a> from you about your projects.  Now is the time to blow your own trumpet and chat to these two lovely Linux loving lunatics.</p>
