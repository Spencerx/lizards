				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I work to improve the openSUSE Tumbleweed (GNU/)Linux distribution. Specifically I make sure that all packages can be built twice on different hosts and still produce identical results, which has <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/buy-in/">multiple benefits</a>. This generates <a href="https://reproducible.alioth.debian.org/blog/posts/109/">a lot of patches</a> in a single week.</p>
<p><strong>OBS</strong><br />
Sometimes it is enough to adjust the .spec file &#8211; that is a small text file usually specific to us. Then <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2011/09/27/get-your-package-in-factory-for-12-1/">it is straight-forward</a></p>
<ol>
<li>osc bco</li>
<li>cd $PROJECT/$PACKAGE</li>
<li>optional: spec_add_patch $MY.patch $SOME.spec</li>
<li>edit *.spec</li>
<li>osc build</li>
<li>osc vc</li>
<li>osc ci</li>
<li>osc sr</li>
</ol>
<p>And OBS will even auto-clean the branch when the submit-request is accepted. And it has a &#8216;tasks&#8217; page to see and track SRs in various stages. For the spec_add_patch to work, you need to do once<br />
ln -s /usr/lib/build/spec_add_patch /usr/local/bin/</p>
<p>When you want to contribute patches upstream, so that other distributions benefit from your improvements as well, then you first need to find out, where they collaborate. A good starting point is the URL field in the .spec file, but a google search for &#8216;contribute $PROJECT&#8217; often is better.</p>
<p><strong>github</strong><br />
Then there are those many projects hosted on github, where it is also pretty low effort, because I already have the account and it even remains signed in. But some repos on github are only read-only mirrors.</p>
<ol>
<li>check pull requests, if some have been merged recently</li>
<li>fork the project</li>
<li>git clone git@github.com:&#8230;</li>
<li>cd $REPO</li>
<li>edit $FILES</li>
<li>git commit -a</li>
<li>git push</li>
<li>open pull request</li>
<li>maybe have to sign a CLA for the project</li>
<li>When change is accepted, delete fork to not clutter up repository list too much (on github under settings)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>sourceforge</strong><br />
The older brother of github. They integrate various ways of contributing. The easiest one is to open a Ticket (Patch or Bug) and attach the .patch you want them to merge with a good description. While many developers do not have the time and energy to debug every bug you file, applying patches is much easier, so gets your issue fixed with a higher chance.</p>
<p><strong>devel Mailinglist</strong><br />
Some projects collaborate mainly through their development MLs, then I need to</p>
<ol>
<li>subscribe</li>
<li>confirm the subscription</li>
<li>git format-patch origin/master</li>
<li>git send-email &#8211;to $FOO-devel@&#8230; &#8211;from $MYSUBSCRIBEDEMAIL 000*.patch</li>
<li>wait for replies</li>
<li>if it is a high-volume ML, also add an IMAP folder and an entry to .procmailrc</li>
<li>unsubscribe</li>
<li>confirm</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>project bugtracker</strong><br />
Like https://bugzilla.gnome.org/ https://bugs.python.org/ https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/ https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/</p>
<ol>
<li>create unique email addr</li>
<li>sign up for account</li>
<li>add info to my account list</li>
<li>optional: search for existing bug (90% of the time there is none)</li>
<li>file bug</li>
<li>attach patch</li>
</ol>
<p>So as you can see there is a wide range of ways. And most of them have some initial effort that you would only have once&#8230; But then I only contribute once per project, so I always pay that.</p>
<p>Thus, please make it easy for people to contribute one simple fix.</p>
