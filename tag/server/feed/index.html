				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Easy-LTSP">Easy-LTSP</a>, an easy to use GUI to configure <a href="http://ltsp.org">LTSP</a>&#8216;s lts.conf file was developed as a part of Google Summer of Code &#8217;08 by <a href="http://luckylemon.de">Jan Weber</a>. It was written in C#, it was decided to use C# at that time to accomplish a complex task in a very short period of time given for GSOC. Thanks to it setting up LTSP on openSUSE is just a few mouse clicks.</p>
<p>Easy-LTSP was designed to work on any distribution, but unfortunately it is not integrated anywhere other than openSUSE, discussing with the upstream LTSP developers suggested the slight reservation could be due to it being written in C#. We wanted to add new features to the GUI to take care of all the exciting new development we have in <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Category:LTSP">KIWI-LTSP</a> so it was felt that the rewrite will be much better option than to extend the current code, as it is anyway being written from scratch why not use something like Python which would be easier to attract more contributors and increase possibility that users of all distributions running LTSP server can benefit from it inclusion in their prefered distro.</p>
<p>Here are the screencaps of the &#8220;Next Generation&#8221; Easy-LTSP(click image to see full album):</p>

<p>The code is in very initial stage, many things do not work yet, these screenies would give some idea where the design is going. If you are a developer interested in hacking get the source <a href="https://forgesvn1.novell.com/viewsvn/kiwi-ltsp/branches/easy-ltsp-ng/trunk/">from here</a>, drop us a line if you want SVN commit access. If you are a user and have some suggestions or an idea how this tool should be like file an enhancement request on <a href="http://devzilla.novell.com/kiwi-ltsp/">devzilla here</a>.</p>
