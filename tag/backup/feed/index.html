Dear community, I would like to present and get your feedback about a new project called bareos [<a href="http://www.bareos.org" target="_blank">1</a>]</p>
<p>I discovered it 6 months ago, after starting to be more and more annoyed by the way the bacula&#8217;s community edition was driven and developed. Even if I was using it since version 1.32 &#8230; First of all, I wish to be clear and shout out my respect to all the work done by Kern on Bacula or any other contributor. We have a really nice working software. We even have a nice build packages for it on OBS.<br />
But it&#8217;s stalled &#8230;</p>
<p>My personal frustration started with the creation of Bacula Enterprise, which has until now never (from what I&#8217;ve seen) reversed an Enterprise feature back to the community. Which in my sense would have been a clear statement &amp; commitment from the Bacula Enterprise to the community.<br />
A Free Software is free once it has been paid once. And more the time pass, more the community edition look like abandoned (windows client binary, bweb, &#8230;) Okay I can understand the enterprise&#8217;s edition arguments, the point is not there according to me.</p>
<p>So at the end of last year, I&#8217;ve started looking what else could replace Bacula for my own usage, and the small/medium customers I serve. Digging on github (my favorite source forge) I discovered bareos project. Basically Bareos is a fork of bacula community edition. With active contribution, and look like what I was looking for. Bareos is a compatible (at the time of writing) drop&#8217;in replacement which offers a bunch of nice feature I was waiting for. Especially high quality windows clients. The whole being cooked on a private obs instances, tested with jenkins, travis &#8230;</p>
<p>Okay I was disappointed about the fact it was a fork, but their website explains the why for those who wish to know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve then started to use it (easy to try with the number of supported platforms) and ready to use package. (Thanks to open build service [2]) Some installations were kept in a compatible way, other in native bareos way. The transition was really easy for anybody knowing how bacula works. After 3 months of production, including full restore, virtual machine backup, etc, I qualified it to be really production ready. Hey the base code and the way patches have been handled certainly explain those results. I also appreciate the effort to make bareos almost ready to use after installation. Trying to reduce the entry level ticket.</p>
<p>The remaining concerns I&#8217;ve found:<br />
&#8211; The community behind will have to grow and success in a truly transparent way.<br />
&#8211; Get new contributors (challenge is the same for bacula, but forking and propose request merge on github is really more cool than email patches)<br />
&#8211; The full remake of the documentation (work in progress)<br />
&#8211; Get a perfect web bconsole<br />
My best hope:<br />
&#8211; Make sustainable, the business plan associated with bareos.com and thus continue to produce quality community software</p>
<p>So did some of you already test it?<br />
What&#8217;s your own feedback, your thoughts about it?</p>
<p>Regards.<br />
