				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear fellows, in our moving free world, it&#8217;s not always bienvenue to talk about one of the *kit* software around.<br />
Most of them have bad reputation, (with good or bad reasons) this is the debate of this post.</p>
<p>But in the uni-kit-verse there&#8217;s one you must known, especially if you are the proud owner of a laptop or one of this computer the manufacter deliver its firmware only in DOS exe format.<br />
FirmwareUpdateKit (was introduced in 2008 in openSUSE by <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2008/06/16/firmwareupdatekit/">Steffen Winterfeldt</a></p>
<h1>How that works?</h1>
<p>As the title of the post give you the right command, open a console, then use the cnf (command-not-found) tool to learn what to do</p>
<h2>Install the package</h2>
<pre>
cnf fuk

The program 'fuk' can be found in the following package:
  * FirmwareUpdateKit [ path: /usr/bin/fuk, repository: zypp (repo-oss) ]

Try installing with:
    zypper install FirmwareUpdateKit
</pre>
<p>Pretty clear and cool, let&#8217;s install that stuff!</p>
<pre>sudo zypper install FirmwareUpdateKit
root's password:

The following NEW packages are going to be installed:
  FirmwareUpdateKit syslinux 

2 new packages to install.
Overall download size: 758.0 KiB. After the operation, additional 2.1 MiB will be used.
Continue? [y/n/?] (y): y

<h2>Get your bios</h2>
<p>Nothing easy for that, you will have to surf on boring mfg website, and find an appropriate bios for your computer.</p>
<p>Be serious during that selection, you can screw up totally your computer</p>
<h2>Time to fuk</h2>
<p>As always before running a program, it&#8217;s always good to check if there&#8217;s the fine manual (not the case here) or try a -h &#8211;help</p>
<pre>
fuk --help
Usage: fuk [OPTIONS] FILES
FirmwareUpdateKit version 1.1.

Create bootable DOS system and add FILES to it.
The main purpose is to assist with DOS-based firmware updates.

Options:
  --grub                        Add boot entry to /boot/grub/menu.lst.
  --lilo                        Add boot entry to /etc/lilo.conf.
  --title TITLE                 Use TITLE as label for boot menu entry.
  --iso FILE                    Create bootable CD.
  --floppy FILE                 Create bootable (1440 kB) floppy disk.
  --image FILE                  Create bootable harddisk.
  --run COMMAND                 Run COMMAND after booting DOS.
  --verbose                     Be more verbose.
</pre>
<p>Nothing complicated as a nuclear plan here, everything seems to be self explicit.<br />
Let try it, and install a new grub entry for the new A8 version for my lappy.
</p>
<pre>
fuk --verbose --grub --run M4600A08.exe /home/bruno/src_tmp/HARDWARE/DELL_M4600/M4600A08.exe 
/tmp/fuk.lSVIgS0cMt/fwupdate.img: chs = 186/4/16, size = 11904 blocks
- writing mbr
- writing fat12 boot block
- copying:
    /usr/share/FirmwareUpdateKit/kernel.sys
    /usr/share/FirmwareUpdateKit/command.com
    /tmp/fuk.lSVIgS0cMt/config.sys
    /tmp/fuk.lSVIgS0cMt/autoexec.bat
    /home/bruno/src_tmp/HARDWARE/DELL_M4600/M4600_A08.exe
c-3po:~ # 
</pre>
<p>That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve now a new entry in my grub list</p>
<pre>
title Firmware Update
    kernel /boot/memdisk
    initrd /boot/fwupdate.img
</pre>
<h2>Apply</h2>
<p>Now just reboot and use the grub entry, then upgrade your bios, like you will normally have done with you old complicated build iso, or diskette (I&#8217;m joking)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog entry is a little bit OffTopic. I&#8217;m writing not about an openSUSE Theme, but about<br />
Linux. Last week i&#8217;ve chatted with the guys in #coreboot @ freenode and it was very<br />
interesting. This article based on an collaborative PR Project from <a title="Carl-Daniels Homepage" href="http://www.hailfinger.org">Carl-Daniel Hailfinger</a>. This first Part of the Article presents Flashrom. The next Article presents Coreboot. The web site of that project is:</p>
<p><a title="Coreboot Site" href="http://www.coreboot.org/">http://www.coreboot.org/</a></p>
<p>The flash utility is known as &#8220;Flashrom&#8221;.</p>
<p>Flashrom is a universal flash programming utility used to detect, read, erase, or write BIOS<br />
chips (parallel, LPC, FWH and SPI technologies) in various packages (DIP, PLCC, SOIC).<br />
It can be used to flash firmware images such as traditional BIOS or coreboot or to back up<br />
the existing firmware.</p>
<p>Everybody who does not want to boot DOS or Windows just to perform a BIOS update can use<br />
flashrom. It does not require a graphics card, monitor or keyboard and can even be used<br />
over SSH on a remote machine. You do not have to reboot to run flashrom, but it is recommended<br />
to reboot after a successful update. Many people are using flashrom as a replacement for<br />
the various AMI/Award/Phoenix BIOS flashing tools out there.</p>
<p>Flashrom supports over 100 flash chips and it is really easy to add support for a new chip<br />
if your board happens to have an unsupported chip.</p>
<p>Flashrom has its own home page: <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Flashrom">http://www.coreboot.org/Flashrom<br />
</a><br />
It is free software released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.</p>
<p>Flashrom is a &#8220;normal&#8221; user space application, but it requires superuser privileges.<br />
Some hardened kernels (which deny access to physical memory) do not support flashrom, but<br />
most distributions out there work fine.</p>
<p>Of course, the usual requirements for BIOS updates apply here as well. You should have a<br />
stable power supply. Switching the machine off during flashing will make your machine<br />
unbootable. Since flashrom treats BIOS files as opaque blobs, you usually do not get any<br />
of the failover/dual BIOS features advertised on some boards.</p>
<p>Backup the current BIOS image into a file:</p>
<p>$ flashrom -r backup.bin</p>
<p>For other usage instructions, please refer to the flashrom home page or the man page.</p>
<p>In case something goes wrong, do NOT reboot, but join #coreboot @freenode and tell the<br />
flashrom developers about it. As long as the machine is still running, there is a good<br />
chance that everything can be fixed.</p>
