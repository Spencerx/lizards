Sunny sky, rainy heart today.</p>
<p>Two days ago, I took the decision to not assist the certainly most fabulous openSUSE Conference next July in Thessaloniki.</p>
<p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<p>A conjunction of several factors lead to that decision.<br />
First what I regret was the chosen date. Damn July is the only expensive period to travel to Thessaloniki. The plane ticket never drop below the 800€ (hey! for sure I want to have Françoise with me), especially with the late announce of precise days. May, June, September would have been so cheaper&#8230;<br />
I can understand the choice main sponsor SUSE do, and their need to spread osc and SUSECON at a 6 month delay in the year&#8217;s schedule, but sadly does not work for me this year.<br />
<div id="attachment_9581" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thessaloniki-back-port.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thessaloniki-back-port-300x200.jpg" alt="Thessaloniki port" width="300" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-9581" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thessaloniki-back-port-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thessaloniki-back-port-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/thessaloniki-back-port.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Thessaloniki port</p></div><br />
Secondly after February marketing hack-fest, I missed (I still don&#8217;t know how) the opportunity to get my travel reimbursed by the TSP and then loose half of the budget for osc. Before TSP get improved, and send a bounce email to ask you to send back your forms. So if you are sponsored for osc, fill and send back your expenses quickly after the event. Don&#8217;t believe you do it, check twice you really do it! Don&#8217;t suppose, be sure!</p>
<p>Another side, I already knew that a customer project will happen during that time-frame. As it concerns a lot of partner&#8217;s I&#8217;ve to take in account the availability of each of them. Unfortunately, after believing that it could be doable to free-up time for osc I decide to stop persecuting myself, and make a deal to live in peace and go ahead: no osc this year.</p>
<p>Maths have their say: statistically, more osc will be, more the chance to miss one will increase <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ( I know still not a real excuses)</p>
<p>I would like to share my deep apologizes to the whole Greek Community in charge of OSC13. You all know, how I was and still am a big found of your commitment and really appreciate each of you.<br />
I will all miss you!</p>
<p>I really hope osc13 will stay in history as one of the ever greatest conference organized. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry Thessaloniki, I know how great the place is, kind the people are, etc..<br />
I&#8217;ll be back soon!</p>
