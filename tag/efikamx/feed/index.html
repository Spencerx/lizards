				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I wrote this week, <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2012/01/19/running-opensuse-on-arm/">how I ran openSUSE on my genesi smarttop</a> some people asked for a ready-to-use image. After spending less than 8 hours fiddling with u-boot-scripts, partition tables, tuning ext3 and initrds, it was done&#8230; and is now so easy:</p>
<blockquote><p>wget http://www.zq1.de/efika.img.xz # 83MB<br />
xz -cd efika.img.xz | dd of=/dev/sdX bs=1M</p></blockquote>
<p>with sdX being the device name of your SD-card (e.g. &#8220;mmcblk0&#8221; on the smarttop itself) with at least 1GB (actually 1024000000 bytes) of free space.</p>
<p>When inserted at boot, it should just boot up within 23 seconds and let you login as root with password &#8220;linux&#8221; on SSH, serial and with a USB-keyboard on HDMI. I spent some effort on putting as few packages as possible into it. Still, you have zypper to install packages and nano to edit files.</p>
<p>There is still a known hangup when you try to reboot. Workaround is: init 2 ; sleep 12 ; killall rsyslogd ; umount /boot/ ; mount -o remount,ro / ; reboot</p>
<p>As it still uses the original linux-2.6.31 kernel, it has another bug that also happens with pre-installed Ubuntu: sometimes (in ~40% of cases), boot stopps early, before graphics is initialized, when the last line on serial is &#8220;console handover: boot [ttymxc0] -&gt; real [tty1]&#8221;. Try turning it off and on again.</p>
<p>This should allow you to have a whole lot of fun&#8230;</p>

<p>This week I finally got my <a href="http://www.genesi-usa.com/products/efika">genesi efika MX</a> box. By default it has on old Ubuntu version installed on its internal IDE-attached 8GB SSD. It features 512 MB RAM and a 800 MHz ARMv7 CPU.</p>
<p>Using a HDMI-cable and an HDMI-DVI-Adaptor I got it connected to a monitor, plugged in a USB keyboard+mouse and it pretty much worked out of the box with WLAN,Ethernet,X11 (except for a bug that causes it to force you to change PW on every console login). How boring.</p>
<p>Having read about recent progress with openSUSE onÂ ARM I wanted the excitement of running it on this box.</p>
<p><a href="http://michal.hrusecky.net/2011/10/opensuse-arm-chroot-less-then-alpha/">Michal&#8217;s image and script</a> (now in alpha) was very helpful to get me started within 15 minutes.</p>
<p>If you have any (e.g. x86) openSUSE system running, there is another easy way to create a working ARM chroot-environment:</p>
<blockquote><p>zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/Tools:/Unstable/openSUSE_12.1/openSUSE:Tools:Unstable.repo<br />
zypper install qemu osc<br />
osc co openSUSE:Factory:ARM bash<br />
cd openSUSE:Factory:ARM/bash<br />
edit bash.spec # add lines with your packages like BuildRequires: zypper,vim<br />
osc build &#8211;no-verify &#8211;clean standard armv7l</p></blockquote>
<p>If it worked well, /var/tmp/build-root/ should contain a chroot environment. E.g. you can run</p>
<blockquote><p>file /var/tmp/build-root/bin/bash<br />
/var/tmp/build-root/bin/bash: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.16, BuildID[sha1]=0xed9ca12f44c8591560d780cf807b6b6cf8ca8873, stripped</p></blockquote>
<p>I partitioned my SD-card into two partitions. The first one for /boot with ext2 (needs only 150MB) and the second one for / to contain the rootfs. Be sure to have barrier=0 in your fstab for all ext[34] partitions so that writing to SD will not be as slow. The default U-Boot configuration first checks on the first partition of an SD-card for boot.scr which is a uImage-formatted version of a U-boot script. I copied all of Ubuntu&#8217;s /boot and /lib/modules/, slightly adapted their boot.script file to have root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 and uImage/uInitrd-2.6.31.14.26-efikamx as kernel/initrd, dropped &#8220;quiet splash&#8221; and added &#8220;console=ttymxc0,115200&#8221; to see more of the boot and ran a line from <a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/pandaboard">another helpful site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -a 0 -e 0 -n &#8220;my boot script&#8221; -d boot.script boot.scr<br />
echo mxc0:S12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty -L 115200 ttymxc0 vt102 &gt;&gt; /etc/inittab # for serial console</p></blockquote>
<p>However, this failed to boot. Using the serial debug console, I could see U-boot trying to load the boot.scr but it was thinking it was zero bytes for some strange reason. Re-creating my /boot partition as a raw copy of /dev/sda1 with my adaptions ontop finally gave me an SD-card that <strong>just boots</strong> openSUSE Factory on ARM with framebuffer console on HDMI/DVI.</p>
