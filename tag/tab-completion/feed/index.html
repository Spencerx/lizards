<p>Completion for package-names <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/zypper/pull/66">just made its way into git</a> (thus soon will appear in Factory aka Tumbleweed) after ~6 weeks of back and forth exploring different approaches.</p>

with allowing some vendor changes for libzypp and libsolv</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I spent some hours implementing nice <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/zypper/pull/66">tab-completion for zypper</a>. There was <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2009/02/12/zypper-improved-bash-completion-and-practical-usage/">already a lot done 6 years ago</a>, but the part about installing/removing packages was missing.</p>
<p>Now the thinking part is about the speed. For the tab-completion I needed a list of installed packages and of course we have that in our RPM database (using berkeley DB as a backend). However querying the list with rpm -qa already took over a second on a modern and fast system. On my poor netbook with a cold cache, it took 25 seconds (5 secs on second try with hot cache)&#8230; And the point is that you probably do not want to wait 5 seconds for your tab-completion to react.</p>
<p>So to avoid this problem, I used caching via make to produce a better format (plain text). This is then post-processed with sed in a fraction of a second &#8211; a speedup factor somewhere between 15 and 150. This makes a big difference.</p>
<p>In the end, I still wonder why plain text is so much faster than a DB. I guess, one reason is that the DB is optimized for retrieval of single values &#8211; e.g. rpm -q bash &#8211; this is very fast (but even there an egrep &#8220;^bash-[^-]+-[^-]+$&#8221; is more than twice as fast).</p>
<p>I still want to optimize zypper for better speed, so that a search might some day return in under 2 seconds. One idea for that is to not parse all those config+repo files every time, but only when they change. It could use mmaped files under /var/cache/zypp* as memory to store the binary representations. Though it might become complicated, if dynamic structures such as linked lists are involved.</p>
<p>The future will be interesting&#8230;</p>
