				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>the <a href="http://software.opensuse.org">openSUSE distribution</a> is the perfect base for specialized projects focusing on a certain area of application. Today, I am happy to announce the start of the <strong>openSUSE Beego</strong> project and ask you to join in and help to bring it to a success, because we rely on your support and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>What is <strong>openSUSE Beego</strong> about? Beego is the perfect customized linux distribution for beekeepers who want to manage their bees on a by today never unreached level. With <strong>openSUSE Beego</strong> we focus on key features like <em>KHive</em>, the management software for the beeyard, the bluetooth based <em>Weightwatch</em> to monitor the hive weigt and of course <em>GHoney</em>, which takes its users to a new level of honey blending by the latest <strong>C</strong>omputer <strong>A</strong>ided <strong>H</strong>oney <strong>B</strong>lending <strong>T</strong>echnology (CAHBT). The latest release of <em>Queen on Rails</em>, a web based bee queen marking and scheduling software is preinstalled and -configured.</p>
<p>All that relies on a perfectly customized kernel to meet the tough requirements of beekeeping. With solid real time capabilities the Beego kernel is able to process all incoming bees at the hives gate for up to 25,000 bee colonies, which is an outstanding high volume no other system ever reached. Both nectar and pollen of each incoming bee are measured and stored into <em>MyBeeSQL</em>, a tuned MySQL variant. Moreover the kernel needed a huge sting proof patch to give it the needed robustness. We could convince a well known openSUSE kernel developer to work on it, discussions on the kernel lists are ongoing under the subject &#8220;Sting Proof Patch&#8221;.</p>
<p>This project has a bright future for both <a href="http://www.opensuse.org">openSUSE</a> and the world of beekeeping. Again I like to ask for your help and contribution. Please spread the word, join our mailinglists,  test and use openSUSE Beego. </p>
<p>That will make the honey even sweeter this year <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
