				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;Welcome to Central Industrial, &#8220;We are the future&#8221;&#8216; is a quote from Blade Runner and now we are entering at last to future with anual <a href="http://www.eu-robotics.net/eurobotics-week/" title="European Robotics Week " target="_blank">European Robotics Week</a>. When Blade Runner world is just around the corner it&#8217;s time to reveal small Robotics pet project with openSUSE and <a href="http://opencv.org/" title="OpenCV">OpenCV</a>.<span id="more-10181"></span></p>
<h2>Starting project</h2>
<p>After reading articles <a href="http://www.einfach-cnc.de/bf20_cnc-umbau.html" title="BF20 CNC-Umbau">like this</a> and <a href="http://www.students.tut.fi/~kontkant/bf20.php.html" title="Optimum BF20 Vario CNC conversion">this</a> I&#8217;ve get idea to turn our mill also to CNC-machine. You can read from those good articles how to make it.They&#8217;ll tell it better than me. If you don&#8217;t read Germany I can let you know neater do I.<br />
I&#8217;ve just took <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno" title="Arduino Uno">Arduino Uno</a> (That was laying around in office), <a href="https://www.synthetos.com/project/grblshield/" title="The Arduino grblShield">grblShield</a> and couple of <a href="http://www.trinamic.com/" title="Trinamic">Trinamic NEMA-17 stepper motor</a> (Not cheapest but they work ok with grblShield). So I was ready to rock.</p>
<h2>Loooooong IDLE</h2>
<p>Then I&#8217;ve take</p>
<pre>
WHILE(1)
  IF HAVE_TIME != YES THEN
    PRINT "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"
    SLEEP MONTH
  ELSE
    PRINT "Hello Doctor Falken, Do you want to play?"
    BREAK
  FI
ELIHW</pre>
<p>Long IDLE and then I  had little spare time so I started project and formulated CNC machine. It&#8217;s not as beautiful as those examples but it works good and it&#8217;s very accurate.</p>
<h2>CNC machine ain&#8217;t robot</h2>
<p>You are correct I just kind of robot. It does what GRBL (G-Code) says but it doesn&#8217;t function by itself. So next when I have more free R&amp;D slots I&#8217;ll take webcam and OpenCV and start converting it to real robot that can function without me.</p>
<h2>But but you didn&#8217;t tell how to get GRBL into Arduino UNO</h2>
<p>Okay I&#8217;ll share this with you and just with you. Download HEX file <a href="https://github.com/grbl/grbl" title="GRBL">from https://github.com/grbl/grbl</a>. Then download Arduino RPMs and avr-dude from <a href="http://build.opensuse.org" title="OBS">http://build.opensuse.org</a>. You got to be on dialout-group in openSUSE to do this (Tune it from YaST2 groups &amp; users position and re-login to it take effect). If you don&#8217;t have any other ACM (probably Modem or GPS device) devices in you machine you device location is probably &#8216;<em>/dev/ttyACM0</em>&#8216; and you also have to know which arduino programming version you have (Mine is <strong>1.0.5</strong>). After that HEX goes in and Arduino blinks light and your robot is alive..</p>
<pre>
avrdude -C/usr/share/arduino-1.0.5/hardware/tools/avrdude.conf -pm328p -carduino -P/your/ACM/device/here -D -U flash:w:your_grbl_hex_here.hex</pre>
<p>Now is time to listen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXa9tXcMhXQ" title="We are the robots">Kraftwerks: We are the robots</a> for few times..</p>
