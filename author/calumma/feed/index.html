				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.muktware.com/2013/12/nvidia-drivers-now-available-opensuse-13-1/17381"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Nvidia-300x168.jpg" alt="Nvidia pic from Muktware" width="300" height="168" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10405" /></a><br />
The NVIDIA drivers for openSUSE 13.1 took a while to appear. Many users have asked why this was and we&#8217;d like to explain what happened and what we plan to do to prevent this in the future. This post was written with input from the openSUSE developers who maintain these drivers at SUSE and work with NVIDIA to make them available for our users.</p>
<h2>How it should work</h2>
<p>Legally, the Linux kernel GPLv2 license leaves proprietary binary drivers in a bit of a tangle. While some claim it should be OK, others say not &#8211; and that is what most distributions currently assume: one can not ship a Linux distribution with proprietary, binary drivers. NVIDIA has agreed that our users can grab their drivers from the official NVIDIA servers. They are packaged by SUSE engineers however. They take care of both SLE and openSUSE proprietary driver packaging for NVIDIA hardware, and have contacts at NVIDIA who get the drivers up on their ftp mirrors.<br />
<a href="http://opensuse-community.org/nvidia.ymp"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Nvidia-1click.png" alt="Nvidia-1click" width="160" height="40" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10406" /></a><br />
The packages are build on a dedicated system, but the package spec (skeleton for building) is in OBS &#8211; for example, <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/X11:Drivers:Video/nvidia-gfxG03">G03 is here</a>. Anybody could use these to build the nvidia driver locally (the nvidia binary driver is grabbed from the nvidia driver during building). The command sequence for local building can be found in <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/X11:Drivers:Video/nvidia-gfxG03/README?expand=1">the README</a>.</p>
<p>Once the packages are build, they are send to NVIDIA, which signs the packages with their key and generates and signs repositories, making them available to the public.</p>
<p>To note is the fact that this is all manual and takes a while on NVIDIA&#8217;s side (and ours). This of course is part of the reason why we don&#8217;t offer NVIDIA packages for Factory, our fast-rolling development repository.</p>
<h2>What happened</h2>
<p>What occurred for 13.1 is a typical case of &#8220;everything went wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>Up until a few weeks before the release, the driver did not build against the Linux Kernel version 3.11. NVIDIA warned against the use of a patch for this problem created by third parties so the driver team did not have a running build. Due to a holiday, it took a while to get the packages build and pushed to NVIDIA. Unfortunately, by the time this was done, the holiday period at NVIDIA blocked progress for another week. Once the package was signed, it took the webteam at NVIDIA another week to get the repository published. It all added up to almost a month and brought quite some inconvenience for users eager to use their latest NVIDIA cards with the latest openSUSE.</p>
<p>About a week later, the openSUSE 13.1 NVIDIA drivers disappeared again from the nvidia servers for a day or so. We don&#8217;t know exactly what happened there, it might have simply been a server issue.</p>
<h2>What we will do</h2>
<p>The first and  most obvious thing to change would be to improve coordination. The developers taking care of the NVIDIA packages should be made aware as early as possible about the release planning and a replacement in case for holidays should be available. We noted this in our 13.1 release report and will make sure that there will be a <a href="http://progress.opensuse.org">task in our task tracker</a> for this for the next release. We also need to talk to NVIDIA about this to make sure that there, too, somebody can fill in for SUSE&#8217;s contacts.</p>
<p>But there are also thoughts on how to improve further. Some of the current ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>To get drivers for Factory the process needs more automation as the driver may break on kernel or X changes</li>
<li>We could try to open the process and work with community members to secure the process in case the SUSE folks are unavailalbe</li>
<li>It would be nice if we could make NVidia to see benefit of working more on the driver in openSUSE, e.g. by doing some testing</li>
<li>We could write some scripts that check regularly whether repo and packages are still available and in a valid state (meta data matches available RPMs)</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to see which of these we can implement, when and how. But rest assured that we will do what we can to prevent this in the future!</p>

<h2>And the stats!</h2>
<p>After a bit of a hiatus, we&#8217;re back with the numbers. Development has slowed down around new year and isn&#8217;t back to speed yet so the 10th spot is shared by quite a big group of people&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, the openSUSE team blog is written by Agustin, talking about the proposals the team has done for openSUSE development.</p>
<p>A few months ago the openSUSE Team started a journey that achieved an important milestone last Tuesday, Nov 26th 2013. We have worked on creating a picture of relevant areas of the project in 2016 together with some of the actions we think should be taken during the following months to achieve it. To stop working and raise your head once in a while to analyze what is around you and setting a direction is a very good exercise.</p>
<h2>The process we followed</h2>
<p>The first step was working on data mining. After many hours of analysis, we identified some clear trends that helped us to establish a solid starting point to begin to work with. Once that phase was over (this is an ongoing process, in fact), we worked for a few weeks/months in trying to define that future picture interviewing several dozens of people. We refined that first attempt through several iterations, including many of those who participated in the original round and others who didn&#8217;t. Susanne Oberhauser-Hirschoff was the person who drove that process with Agustin.</p>
<p>We soon realized that discussing high level ideas in a community used to &#8220;Get shit done&#8221; was going to be easier if we complement them with some more down to earth proposals, specially in technical aspects. We cannot forget that, after all, openSUSE is a technical (and very pragmatic) focused community.</p>
<p>So, in parallel with the already mentioned refinement of the big picture, we started discussing within the team the actions needed to take to make the big picture a reality, the openSUSE development version a.k.a Enhanced/New Factory. After many hours of (sometimes never ending) discussions, we agreed on the ideas we are currently being published, together with the motivations behind them.</p>
<p>Another aspect we tried to bring to the discussion has been a strong dose of realism, trying to ensure that whatever we came up to was compatible with the nature of the project. We have also put focus on making sure that the initial proposal is achievable. So as part of community, we understand very well we cannot succeed alone. We need to work with you. So we just opened with the community a process analogous to what we went through within the team. It might be different in form but similar in principles and goals.</p>
<h2>What are we going through these days?</h2>
<p>These days the proposals are being discussed in different mailing lists. We are collecting feedback, discussing it, summarizing it, adapting the proposal to it &#8230; trying to reach agreements before defining what to do next.</p>
<h2>What the proposal looks like?</h2>
<p>We divided the proposal in a series of smaller proposals we are publishing in the project mailing list, where the general community topics in openSUSE are discussed, and/or factory ML, where the more technical discussions take place.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2013-11/msg00094.html">openSUSE 2016: taking a picture of openSUSE today</a><br />
This mail summarizes the analysis phase we went through. We have tried to provide a simple picture of openSUSE today so the following articles can be justified to some extend.</li>
<li><a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2013-11/msg00118.html">openSUSE 2016 picture</a><br />
This text summarizes the proposed picture for the end of 2016 (in three years). The goal is to set a direction for openSUSE</li>

openSUSE Development Workflow</span></p>
<li><a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2013-11/msg00920.html">O Factory &#8211; Where art Thou?</a><br />
Stephan Kulow summarizes the Action Plan for the first aspect pointed in the previous picture: the new Development process (Factory).</li>
</ol>
<p>The following articles describe in more detail some relevant (also new) elements pointed in the previous article, since they are new or modify the current process significantly. Some of the articles are in the queue to be published.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2013-12/msg00044.html">One of the options for staging projects</a><br />
In this mail Michal Hrusecky provides some details and examples on how the new staging projects might work in the future.</li>
<li><a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2013-12/msg00132.html">openQA in the new proposal</a><br />
This text, written by Ludwig Nussel, explains the principles that should drive the inclusion of openQA in the Factory development process, according with the proposed workflow.</li>
<li><a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2013-12/msg00147.html">Karma for all</a><br />
This mail, written by Ancor González, summarizes our ideas to include a social feature in the process to help achieving Factory goals.</li>
<li><a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2013-12/msg00318.html">Policies, or why it&#8217;s good to know how to change things</a><br />
The new process needs to be adaptive. Antonio Larrosa proposed a way, taking what other projects do in this regard as reference.</li>
</ol>
<p>There might be an eighth article describing some smaller, still relevant, ideas. After publishing the &#8220;content&#8221;, we will release one last article providing a information about how to achieve these ideas, describing also our compromise in terms of effort and pointing out the challenges we perceive in the plan from the execution point of view.</p>
<p>We would like to invite you to the debate if you haven&#8217;t raised your opinions yet.</p>

Finally, openSUSE Linux 13.1 <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2013/11/19/opensuse-13-1-ready-for-action/" title="release announcement on news.o.o" target="_blank">has been released</a>. It has been 8 months since the release of 12.3 in which we&#8217;ve been working in a lot of things, but specially in the last weeks, all the geekos have been quite busy trying to make it our best release ever. And we hope it shows.</p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;re wondering what exactly we&#8217;ve been doing in these weeks previous to the release, well, that&#8217;s what Antonio Larossa is going to talk about in this post.<span id="more-10164"></span></p>
<h2>Testing, testing and more testing</h2>
<p>The main task we have been doing at the openSUSE team during this time has been testing different configurations with different hardware and different installation options. In total, we tested openSUSE 13.1 in aproximately 32.000 ways!</p>
<p>Obviously, putting people to work on such a large amount of tests would be impractical, so even though we also did manual tests (and a lot of them!), most of them were done by openQA, our automated QA testing tool. With openQA, we can automate the installation of openSUSE (or any other distro, every OS, in fact) checking without human intervention that everything works as expected and that a fix in one place doesn&#8217;t break something else in some other place.</p>
<p>During the last months, we worked on some improvements to openQA that have made it much more suitable for testing more things more easily.</p>
<p>Aside from finding problems by testing the distribution, someone also has to fix issues, so on the 27th of September, we did a <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2013/09/16/beta-pizza-and-hackaton/" target="_blank">BetaPizza hackaton</a> which was quite a success, with 121 people contributing to get over 580 bugs closed with 140 fixed and 440 screened. Here is the <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2013/10/15/betapizza-hackaton-results/" target="_blank">blog post with the results of that event</a>.<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/factory-tested.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/factory-tested.png" alt="factory-tested" width="217" height="232" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9447" /></a></p>
<h2>The release candidates</h2>
<p>After RC1 was released, we did several things in order to improve the testing. First, on the 25th of October, we created a shared spreadsheet with a list of things to test in each row, and people names in each column. This way, everyone would know what to test and if there&#8217;s anything that hasn&#8217;t been tested by anybody. Even if some test was already done, we encouraged everyone to repeat it in order to try different hardware configurations. 13 persons in total tested everything that was listed in that spreadsheet. We would like to thank specially the people from the community that joined us in that task (in order of appearance): pluskalm, oholecek, pier_andreit, pearson45j, Andrei Amuraritei, Olivn and dcw.</p>
<p>Doing those tests we already observed that most things were working as expected, so that gave us confidence that 13.1 would be a great release. But still there was work to do. For each problem found, it was either fixed if it was a minor issue, or a report was created in bugzilla so that they could be assigned to the right persons to look into it and fix it.</p>
<p>At the SUSE offices, some of us also burned lots of DVDs with the RC to spread around and get as many people as possible to test it and report issues.<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/what-I-think-I-do-marketing.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/what-I-think-I-do-marketing-300x221.png" alt="what I think I do marketing" width="300" height="221" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9832" /></a></p>
<h2>Final testing and release marketing</h2>
<p>Then came RC2 and with it, the final round of tasks previous to the release. On one hand, we did a list with the most grave bugs in bugzilla that were still open for 13.1 and created another shared spreadsheet with that information. We decided that for each issue, we would analyze it and try to either fix it or find a workaround that we could specify in the release notes. This resulted in very complete <a href="http://doc.opensuse.org/release-notes/x86_64/openSUSE/13.1/" target="_blank">Release Notes</a>.</p>
<p>During all this time, we also prepared lots of marketing material like the release announcement on <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2013/11/19/opensuse-13-1-ready-for-action/">news.openSUSE.org</a>, the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Features" target="_blank">feature guide on the wiki</a>, front- and portal pages, nice images (like the wolf-geeko) and created a press kit with this and more to inform journalists about the release.</p>
<p>We also worked on media messages suited for most social networks, in order to use them on the release day. Many texts and social media messages were translated by volunteers to Greek, Italian, Chinese, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, etc.</p>
<p>All this resulted in great coverage by the press &#8211; a selection you can find on <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/In_the_press">our wiki page with press clips</a> (if reviews or mentions are missing &#8211; go ahead, add it!).</p>

<h2>Introducing Linuxdays 2013</h2>
<p>Of course you remember the openSUSE Conference 2012: <a href="http://bootstrapping-awesome.org/">bootstrapping awesome</a>, the four-for-the-price-of-one event? The one in Prague? We had the combination of the openSUSE Conference, SUSE Labs, a Gentoo miniconf and the local LinuxDays conference. The last two for the first time ever. While Gentoo miniconf didn&#8217;t have continuation, LinuxDays conference has been bootstrapped successfully and this year in the beginning of October, the conference took place for the second time. And Amazing it was.</p>
<h2>Visitors and talks</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with some numbers. Before the conference started, there were 650 registrations. On Saturday about 400 people went through registration and on Sunday about 300 joined the event. A little geeky number &#8211; about 600 different Mac addresses connected to the WiFi. The event featured 31 talks and 6 workshops for these visitors.<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/building-a-3D-printer.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/building-a-3D-printer-300x200.jpg" alt="building a 3D printer at Linuxdays 2013" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10044" /></a></p>
<p>Presentations were for both beginners and advanced geeks. There were talks describing Gnome 3 evolution, news in Libre Office or how openSUSE gets created. On the other hand, there were talks about MySQL fine tunning, an introduction to Autotools and a session about TCP Multipath.</p>
<h2>Workshops and booths</h2>
<p>Another interesting part of the conference was the 3D printing workshop. It ran through the whole Saturday and a part of Sunday. People could order parts for 3D printers with delivery to the conference and there was a team of experienced 3D printer builders in the workshop helping people build their own printer. There was huge interest in this workshop, but due to the limited capacity, only the first nine registrations were accepted. In the end all nine 3D printers were successfully built and many people saw and learned how to build their own!<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Geeko-popular.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Geeko-popular-200x300.jpg" alt="Geeko popular at Linuxdays 2013" width="200" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10047" /></a></p>
<p>Like last year, there were booths with various interesting open source projects.  Mainly distributions &#8211; Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, openSUSE, Slax and Ubuntu &#8211; but there were also XFCE and Geany booths, an OpenMobility booth and a booth with some geeky stuff to buy, like mugs, T-shirts or Raspberry-Pi&#8217;s with various shields.</p>
<p>As far as the openSUSE stand goes, people liked our DVDs, both the ones with openSUSE and SLE (we had some evaluation versions to give away), but as always Geeko got the most attention. People just <em>looooove</em> this lizard. We had plenty of questions regarding where can they get one.</p>
<p>Overall, the conference was quite a success and there will definitely be a LinuxDays 2014!</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>

As part of the openSUSE community efforts gearing up for openSUSE 13.1, the openSUSE team has been hard at work on a variety of things. Ludwig Nussel, in his role of <em>controller</em> in the team, keeps an eye on progress of the tasks we have been assigned. He gives an overview of some of the things we have been doing.</p>
<h2>For beta 1</h2>
<p>For beta 1 the focus was on testing and of course practical changes in a variety of areas. Here&#8217;s a list of the tasks on <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/opensuse-13-1-release/issues?c[]=project&amp;c[]=tracker&amp;c[]=priority&amp;c[]=status&amp;c[]=subject&amp;c[]=author&amp;c[]=assigned_to&amp;c[]=fixed_version&amp;c[]=due_date&amp;c[]=relations&amp;f[]=status_id&amp;f[]=fixed_version_id&amp;f[]=&amp;group_by=&amp;op[fixed_version_id]==&amp;op[status_id]=c&amp;per_page=50&amp;set_filter=1&amp;utf8=✓&amp;v[fixed_version_id][]=43">progress.opensuse.org</a>.</p>
<p>After the btrfs discussion we checked out how often it is used and did some recommendations to give it extra testing. The result was that it was clearly mentioned in the Beta announcement and that during the installation YaST2 would ask if you could test btrfs.</p>
<p><a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/opensuse-13-1-release/issues/gantt?f[]=status_id&amp;f[]=&amp;month=3&amp;months=8&amp;op[status_id]=*&amp;set_filter=1&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;year=2013&amp;zoom=3"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/gantt-chart-1024x517.png" alt="gantt chart" width="700" height="357" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-10038" /></a></p>
<p>We organized the Beta Pizza Hackaton, getting internal help from the SLE team on fixing openSUSE bugs. The idea came up to make it a contest. We went over the bugs that were reported, putting them in categories (bronze/silver/gold) to signify importance for the release. We developed an IRC bot to announce changes and a script to record who-did-what to help a committee of &#8216;wise men&#8217; to decide who would win.</p>
<p>In the technical area, we agreed with the documentation team to move the manuals into activedoc. That way they are easier to maintain and always up to date. And Greek was included as primary language on the dvd! We also had to work with MS to get the bootloader and kernel signed properly for UEFI systems, we documented the development process, hacked further on testing tools, and of course there was a lot of writing of articles for news.opensuse.org.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we&#8217;ve been talking to Open Source press and helping them to ensure we have a boxed version of openSUSE 13.1 in Germany. We (and the openSUSE Board, as it is their decision) are still looking for providers in other countries!<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/13.1_openSUSE_3D_400px.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/13.1_openSUSE_3D_400px-264x300.png" alt="13.1 openSUSE 3D box" width="264" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10030" /></a></p>
<h2>RC1</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of the tasks on <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/opensuse-13-1-release/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;set_filter=1&amp;f[]=status_id&amp;op[status_id]=c&amp;f[]=fixed_version_id&amp;op[fixed_version_id]=%3D&amp;v[fixed_version_id][]=44&amp;f[]=&amp;c[]=project&amp;c[]=tracker&amp;c[]=priority&amp;c[]=status&amp;c[]=subject&amp;c[]=author&amp;c[]=assigned_to&amp;c[]=fixed_version&amp;c[]=due_date&amp;c[]=relations&amp;group_by=">progress.opensuse.org</a>. And the summary:</p>
<p>To help the marketing team, we made and ran a script to remind packagers to tell marketing about their features. Based on this and help from the community, we made a start with the feature guide, writing about KDE, GNOME and the Linux kernel. A second goal was to get the &#8216;promote openSUSE 13.1&#8242; article out, for which we had to kick people for artwork and we had to update countdown.opensuse.org. We also updated software.opensuse.org with information about the USB stick installation.</p>
<p>On the technical side, we did a lot of testing work and of course pick fixes to go into Factory. There was also work with Legal for a new EULA (End User License Agreement) which does not mention Novell anymore (will be included in the final); and we added openSUSE 13.1 to bugzilla, pinged our translators about the release and kicked people about the community repos.</p>
<h2>A lot</h2>
<p>As you can see, there are a lot of tasks we have to juggle. <a href="http://progress.opensuse.org">progress.opensuse.org</a> with it&#8217;s <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/opensuse-13-1-release/issues/gantt?f[]=status_id&amp;f[]=&amp;month=3&amp;months=8&amp;op[status_id]=*&amp;set_filter=1&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;year=2013&amp;zoom=3">useful Gantt chart</a> is a big help for that, but it also simply requires work: checking what is done, what is not done, kicking people to do their thing. We&#8217;re hoping to get more community members involved with progress.opensuse.org &#8211; a few are already helping out via this tool and you&#8217;re welcome to check out how we do it!</p>
<p>The end result is that we can release a quality product, on time &#8211; something to be proud of!</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re back with weekly statistics (the stats from last week were in the <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2013/10/11/opensuse-13-1-rc-1-available-time-to-test/">RC1 announcement</a>. Here are the top-10 contributors to openSUSE Factory of the last week:</p>

<h2>openQA and testing openSUSE</h2>
<p>Our work on openQA <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/06/06/openqa-in-opensuse/">was introduced a few months ago</a> on this blog. To recap, the major improvements we made were related to the detection of failed and succeeded tests by introducing the &#8216;needles&#8217; (PNG files with metadata associated in JSON format) and using openCV to determine test results; and a host of changes to speed up the testing process and improve the webUI a bit. The work is currently <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/openQA">residing in a branch by the openSUSE team on github</a> but the original author, Bernhard Wiedemann, <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/projects/49">plans to test, integrate and deploy openQA</a> during hackweek.</p>
<p>The fact that the new code isn&#8217;t running on <a href="http://openqa.opensuse.org">openqa.opensuse.org</a> yet is unfortunate but not a huge issue. Right now, to contribute test cases, you have to install and run openQA yourself. And with the packages available for openSUSE this is not a huge deal.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s talk about using openQA and creating test cases!</p>
<h3>Installing openQA</h3>
<p>Installing openQA is easy. Add a repository in zypper, install some packages and run some scripts. You can find a full description of the installation process in the <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst/raw/master/doc/tutorial.pdf">openQA Tutorial</a>. In summary, you have to go through these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Install the repository and the packages and reboot</strong><br />
<code>% zypper ar <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:openQA/openSUSE_12.3">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:openQA/openSUSE_12.3</a> devel:openQA</code><br />
<code>% zypper in openQA kvm OVMF</code><br />
<code>% reboot</code></p>
<p><strong>Install needles and fix ownership</strong><br />
<code>% /usr/lib/os-autoinst/tools/fetchneedles</code><br />
<code>% cd /var/lib/os-autoinst/needles</code><br />
<code>% sudo chown -R wwwrun distri</code></p>
<div id="attachment_9476" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/factory.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9476 " title="testing in progress!" alt="testing in progress!" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/factory_crop-300x169.png" width="300" height="169" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">testing in progress!</p></div>
<p>After that we need to make some adjustment in the apache configuration before we can run the service. See the <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst/raw/master/doc/tutorial.pdf">openQA Tutorial</a> for the details.</p>
<h3>Get testing</h3>
<p>openQA testing works on the base of ISO images which we have to provide to openQA. So the next logical step is to download the last development ISO image from <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/developer/">software.opensuse.org/developer</a> and copy it to /var/lib/openqa/factory/iso. Now we can create the jobs (different test sets) and launch the server:</p>
<p><code>% rpc.pl --host localhost iso_new /var/lib/openqa/factory/iso/*.iso </code></p>
<p>If we have systemd running, the workers will take the jobs, create a virtual machine, and run the tests in order.</p>
<h3>Look Ma, my first test!</h3>
<p>Once openQA is installed we can start creating and running tests. Tests are written in Perl, and use an API exported by openQA to the applications. The internal logic of a test is something like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The test sends a set of events (keystrokes) to the virtual machine</li>
<li>openQA takes screenshots of the consequences of these events</li>
<li>The test compares the resulting images with a database of images (or needles, see the <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/06/06/openqa-in-opensuse/">previous openQA article</a> for details)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/stopwatch.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9448 alignright" alt="stopwatch" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/stopwatch-227x300.png" width="113" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>We can move through the installation process using this cycle multiple times. For example, in the test 051_installation_mode.pm we can find this:</p>
<p><code>sendkey $cmd{"next"};</code><br />
<code>waitforneedle("inst-timezone", 30) || die 'no timezone';</code></p>
<p>In the first command we send a keystroke to the system, in this case alt-n because the dictionary $cmd maps the “next” key to this keystroke. After that we wait 30 seconds and check if we find an image compatible with the “inst-timezone” needle.</p>
<p>Inside a test, the main function that can be used to send events is sendkey(), and sendautotype() when we want to send a full string. When we want to assert the current image we can use waitforneedle(), which launches an exception if the needle is not found, and checkneedle(), which returns the result in case that we have a match between the current image and a needle.</p>
<h3>More complicated tests</h3>
<p>Using this basic functionally we can build higher levels of abstraction to simplify the interaction between the test and the system. For example, we can build a function that writes the password when we execute a sudo command. One of the problems when we execute a program as a root inside a test is that the system not always asks for the root password when we call the sudo program. We can work around this as follows:</p>
<p><code>sub sudo() {</code><br />
<code>my $passwd = shift;</code><br />
<code>my $prog = shift;</code><br />
<code>sendautotype("sudo $prog\n");</code><br />
<code>if (checkneedle("sudo-passwordprompt", 2)) {</code><br />
<code>sendautotype(passwd);</code><br />
<code>sendkey "ret";</code><br />
<code>}</code><br />
<code>}</code></p>
<p>We use checkneedle() instead of waitforneedle() to make a decision inside the test instead of making an assert and marking the test as failed.</p>
<p>An openQA test is in fact an instance of an object. We usually inherit from a base class an overwrite one of the methods to run the test. The basic structure of a test is:<br />
<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/63567936@N00/4210167891/" title="Headless Horse by Perry McKenna, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2632/4210167891_dbfe5d540f_n.jpg" width="320" height="192" class="alignright" alt="Finding the needle"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Horsies looking for needles</p></div></p>
<p><code>use base "basetest";</code><br />
<code>use strict;</code><br />
<code>use bmwqemu;</code><br />
<code># Determine if the test can run.</code><br />
<code>sub is_applicable() {</code><br />
<code>}</code><br />
<code># Main code of the test</code><br />
<code>sub run() {</code><br />
<code>}</code><br />
<code># Return a map of flags to decide if the fail</code><br />
<code># of this test is important, or to decide a</code><br />
<code># rollback of the VM status.</code><br />
<code>sub test_flags() {</code><br />
<code>}</code><br />
<code>1;</code></p>
<p>The method is_applicable() is called to check if the test can run for a given configuration (more about this later). If the function returns true, openQA will call the run() method. It is in this function that we need to put the test code.</p>
<p>The test_flags() is used to decide what to do when the test fails. Depending on what this function returns, openQA can decide to mark the ISO as a wrong ISO if the test fails, or mark only this tests as failed and continue with the next test. There is one more interesting feature here. OpenQA makes snapshots of the CPU, the memory and the hard disk (using a QEMU option). If the test goes well openQA creates a snapshot labeled &#8216;lastgood&#8217; that can be recovered if the next test fails. This feature is useful to guarantee that every test can be started from a stable system (and failing tests can put the system in an non stable state).</p>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>When openQA creates a new test job, what is really doing is setting a specific combination of environment variables that need to be checked by the test in order to adjust the test&#8217;s behavior or to discard itself (through the is_applicable() method).</p>
<p>For example, when we want to test the KDE Desktop Environment, openQA create a new variable named DESKTOP with value “KDE”. This variable can be checked in the test code using $ENV{DESKTOP}. As another example, say we want to create a test to check if Firefox is working properly on two desktops. We can use:</p>
<p><code>sub is_applicable() {</code><br />
<code>return $ENV{DESKTOP}=~/kde|gnome/;</code><br />
<code>}</code></p>
<p>If the variable DESKTOP is not KDE or GNOME, the test will not be executed.</p>
<h3>I want to learn more</h3>
<p>If you want to dig into openQA, you can check the source code and the different tests that are now running every day in our deployed instance. You can find the source code of V1 in Bernhard Wiederman&#8217;s repository <a href="https://github.com/bmwiedemann/os-autoinst">github.com/bmwiedemann/os-autoinst</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bmwiedemann/openQA">github.com/bmwiedemann/openQA</a>, V2 is currently in the openSUSE Github account at <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst">github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/openQA">github.com/openSUSE-Team/openQA</a> with here the <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst-needles">needles</a>. As mentioned before, Bernhard plans on integrating the V1- and V2 code during <a href="http://hackweek.suse.com">hackweek</a>.</p>
<p>You can grab the code to learn by checking other tests, like for example the ones in x11test.d and inst.d.</p>
<h2>Contribute!</h2>
<p>There is a simple way to start contributing to openSUSE through openQA:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install openQA</li>
<li>Create a new test in x11test.d to test your application</li>
<li>Send a pull request to the project with the test and the needles</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, these tests would then be used by the openSUSE team (running internally) to keep the quality of the upcoming release up, but once V1 and V2 are merged and deployed, you can see and act on the results on <a href="http://openqa.opensuse.org">openqa.opensuse.org</a>.<br />

<h2>The weekly statistics</h2>
<p>And as every week, here&#8217;s the top-10 contributors to openSUSE Factory of last week. We&#8217;re pretty much in bug fixing mode now so a big thanks to each of the contributors for helping make openSUSE 13.1 stable!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com">Jos Poortvliet</a> wrote shortly before the conference <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2013/07/11/merchandising/">about merchandising</a>. Today, he updates us on the status.</p>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>As a quick recap from the earlier blog, note that the goal of the merchandising program is to support openSUSE ambassadors in visiting events and representing openSUSE there. The old program suffered from some issues, including bad planning, bad materials and very expensive shipping. It was simply not very efficient and we didn&#8217;t know how much good it did (or not).</p>
<h2>The plans</h2>
<p>What we want to do can be best summarized as emphasizing quality over quantity and having a proper process. That means making a decent plan for supplying important events with a big box of quality materials and making sure we get a good return on the efforts we put in. And, as started with the <a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2012/02/opensuse-travel-support-program.html" target="_blank">Travel Support Program</a>, we&#8217;d like the community to be in charge of it all, not SUSE.</p>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>A simplified process picture would look somewhat like this:<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Booth-materials-process.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Booth-materials-process-888x1024.jpg" alt="Booth materials process" width="500" height="600" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9857" /></a></p>
<p>The ambassador/local coordinator/TSP teams make an event plan every six months or every year, looking at what events are coming. They classify them, determining what level of support each gets and who is going. This is of course coordinated with the individual ambassadors. The team then asks the openSUSE Team at SUSE to send the materials to the ambassadors, who in turn go and visit the event. At the end of every month we can let the wider community know about the events we visited!</p>
<h3>Where we are</h3>
<p>Right now, we&#8217;ve assembled a list of events, based on ambassador feedback and earlier event plans. I&#8217;ve also figured out what shipping options we have and what they would cost and made a plan for the contents of the box. I&#8217;d like to start with two different boxes, a big and a small one, and I have selected about 20 events which would get a box. 7 events will have visitors from the openSUSE team, so we&#8217;d be supporting 27 events with materials and people. Of course, the Travel Support Team can support other events &#8211; and we have the ability to locally produce materials as well. And after the first year, all this can be changed, with more and cheaper boxes (or fewer and bigger), different event selections and improved content.</p>
<h3>Issues</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re aware that this plan is not perfect: quite a few people who received materials in the last years won&#8217;t with this plan. But that&#8217;s what happens when you decide to focus on a smaller number of events&#8230; And we have and can think about solutions for that; for example, create a 1-kg event box with very reasonable shipping costs. Second, planning is hard and harsh, and we want to be flexible in that regard, and open for feedback.</p>
<h2>Current status</h2>
<p>So where are we now? Unfortunately, there has not been as much progress since the openSUSE conference as we hoped. A blocking issue is the availability of an artist handling the creation of materials we decided on. This will have to be done at SUSE with only a limiting role (for now) by the community artists. We are of course working on hiring somebody for this task but unfortunately one doesn&#8217;t <em>just</em> hire somebody.</p>
<p>However, what we do have is a good idea of shipping, a decent event plan and we not only determined mostly what we&#8217;d like to ship in each box (and how heavy they will be) but also have already started talking to suppliers. So as soon as we can get the artwork situation resolved, we should be able to get up and running in relatively short order &#8211; hopefully before the end of this year.</p>
<p>To give you a bit of an idea of what we have, see the image below.<br />
<img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/openSUSE-Booth-styled_numbers.png" alt="openSUSE Booth styled" width="700" height="550" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9858" /></p>
<ul>
<ol><strong>1.</strong> There is about 2 kg of basic tools like duct tape, colored markers, a network and a vga cable, a dozen openSUSE pens and some trash bags (only in the big box)</ol>
<ol><strong>2.</strong> There is stuff for the table: a table cloth, flyer holder, table display (cube) and we&#8217;d like to have caps or bandana&#8217;s for the team</ol>
<ol><strong>3.</strong> Of course we have a cool and lightweight X-banner (if we can make it fit, they&#8217;re either big, heavy or both)</ol>
<ol><strong>4.</strong> We include some posters with information and for putting up a schedule</ol>
<ol><strong>5.</strong> And then there are some give-aways like stickers, flyers and perhaps cool posters with Unix Cheat Sheets or other info on them</ol>
</ul>
<p>A big thanks for Anditosan for making the images that make the example booth picture here look good. He&#8217;s already gathering potential artwork for the booths and if you have any input &#8211; direct it to the <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-artwork/">openSUSE artwork mailing list</a>.</p>
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>So, the plan now is that once we have a designer, we create and print the materials, assemble the boxes, make appointments with the ambassadors for the events we&#8217;ve planned and start shipping.</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>While merchandising seems to be on ice, development is still very active. Factory is now frozen with the Beta out, so we&#8217;re going to focus on bugfixing. The top contributors last week were:</p>

This week, the openSUSE Team Blog is written by <a href="http://toscalix.blogspot.de/" title="Agustin's blog" target="_blank">Agustin Benito</a> who talks about how we&#8217;ve been documenting our work around openSUSE.</p>
<p>Development a GNU/Linux based distribution like openSUSE can be divided in two major phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>openSUSE Development process: creation and integration of the different packages. Milestones (alphas) and Beta.</li>
<li>openSUSE Release process: stabilization, QA and task related with the availability of the different images. Update process. From Beta to the Release.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also three major continuous actions throughout the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management of the process.</li>
<li>Communication and marketing related tasks.</li>
<li>Development of new features</li>
</ul>
<p>The development of new features usually happens upstream or within SUSE (in collaboration with community members) before it is added to the distribution. This phase takes place before or in parallel with the Development process (of packages and integration).</p>
<h2>Focus: the openSUSE Team</h2>
<p>The decision taken by SUSE during 12.2 to concentrate the SUSE employees working on openSUSE in a single department by creating the openSUSE Team had as consequence that new people has joined us to work in openSUSE. One of the early decisions within the openSUSE Team at SUSE was to put more focus on the distribution. The Release Team was created as a subset of the openSUSE Team, formed by Coolo and Tomas (Ismail Dönmez and Michal Hrušecký were also part of it in the past) to take care of the Development process. It was also decided that the whole Team would have as major goal to drive the Release process.<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/documentation.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/documentation.png" alt="documentation icon" width="161" height="176" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9928" /></a></p>
<h2>Documenting the process</h2>
<p>Starting in July 2012, the openSUSE Team at SUSE has put effort in documenting the Development + Release process. Throughout the years, the process has evolved and some of those changes were not documented or the documentation was not up to date. We have taken the opportunity to analyze the the Dev+Release process, so we could learn from it and being able to design and execute changes to improve it.</p>
<h3>The release process</h3>
<p>As Team, we focused first on the Release process. We made an initial effort during the last few weeks of the 12.2 Release process, and we improved it during the first milestones of the 12.3 Release. For this 13.1 Release, only minor updates have been required.</p>
<p>Increasing the efficiency of the management side of things and structuring our work as a formal project has been another aspect of this. We set up a management tool that now is used together with the openSUSE sysadmin team. Ludwig Nussel is the controller of our efforts as team in the Release, planned through <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/opensuse-13-1-release">progress.opensuse.org</a>. The combination of this planning and the improved release documentation has helped us to increase our efficiency despite new people joining our team.</p>
<h3>The development process</h3>
<p>During the past few weeks we have concentrated our efforts in analyzing and documenting the Development process. Our goal has been to analyze it, providing a high level view and just the minimum amount of details required to understand it by people with some knowledge of these kind of software integration processes.</p>
<p>We have recently published a <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2013-09/msg00086.html">draft of the Development process</a> on the openSUSE Factory mailing list and are open for feedback.</p>
<h4>Writing process</h4>
<p>How was this document done?</p>
<ul>
<ol>1.- The first action was to analyze existing documentation about the Development process. We took as sources several articles from openSUSE wiki and some previous analysis done by the former Boosters Team in this area.</ol>
<ol>2.- We organized two sessions in which different people described the different steps of the process. These sessions were taped.</ol>
<ol>3.- We transcribed the sessions and created a first document containing all the information about the process. </ol>
<ol>4.- We processed that &#8220;story&#8221; in order to get the high level view of the process.</ol>
<ol>5.- Using the ETVX methodology, we elaborated a first draft of the document.</ol>
<ol>6.- We analyzed the result within the openSUSE Team and, after introducing some changes, we opened the discussion about it to other SUSE employees involved in the Development process.</ol>
<ol>7.- Finally, in order to make the document easier to read (it is a complex process, so the documentation needs time to digest), we introduced improvements in the format and published in the openSUSE wiki, together with the .pdf version.</ol>
</ul>
<p>This process has allowed us to analyze and discuss the process as a team, learning not just about the hows but the whys. It has also worked as a test for documenting future changes in how openSUSE is developed. We also hope that the effort can be worth it to contributors that want to get a high level view of how openSUSE works, since some of the tasks are done in house. This document has to be seen also as an exercise of transparency.</p>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<p>At openSUSE Team, we are strong believers of the principle &#8220;<em>no data -&gt; no analysis -&gt; no improvements</em>&#8220;. We think we are better prepare now to propose to the community improvements in factory to make it more usable for a wider range of contributors.<br />

Our team blog this week is written by <a href="https://plus.google.com/111216911194600408657" target="_blank">Stephan &#8216;coolo&#8217; Kulow</a> and he talks about work in the team done on the Open Build Service.</p>
<h2>Search</h2>
<p>For years one of the biggest complaint about the webUI was that it is impossible to find packages. The <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/search" target="_blank">search ability</a> has been part of the interface from the beginning, but with over 200.000 packages being build today it is crucial to get the <strong>right</strong> package.</p>
<h3>Where is my kernel?</h3>
<p>Especially for developers new to openSUSE and the build service it is common to have to search for the package to fix for a specific bug. So you find yourself looking for <em>kernel</em> in the webUI and you are prompted with tons of results that are displayed in a rather random order and the notion that your search resulted in more than 200 hits and is basically invalid. Huh? home:foobar:latest-experiments:kernel is surely <em>not</em> the openSUSE kernel to fix, but then what is?</p>
<p>Now if you ask google about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kernel+site%3Abuild.opensuse.org&amp;hl=en">&#8220;kernel site:build.opensuse.org&#8221;</a> you get closer to the problem at hand: &#8220;About 16,800 results&#8221; &#8211; that is a lot to pick the first 20 results to display from. The OBS webUI tried to find a good pick with an algorithm that might have been clever when build.opensuse.org had 100 projects. Today, it can only be called old and useless.<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/obs-in-action.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/obs-in-action-300x199.jpg" alt="obs in the dark" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9864" /></a></p>
<h2>Ancor for world fame</h2>
<p>So I tricked <a href="https://plus.google.com/114260811841185028896/about">Ancor</a> to look into the problem by claiming he would get all the praises in the OBS world for implementing a sane search.</p>
<p>The problem is far from trivial, but there are good tools to get a better result than what we had now and Ancor has a lot of experience with these (and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails" target="_blank">Rails</a> in general). So it seemed like he could attain a great balance between effort and outcome.</p>
<p>But as always the devil lay in the details, so this post is also about getting feedback about the actual result.</p>
<h3>What we did</h3>
<p>Ancor integrated <a href="http://pat.github.io/thinking-sphinx/">Thinking Sphinx</a> into the OBS, so the name, title and description can be combined with other attributes into one big index that allows page ranking.</p>
<p>Additionally there is no limit of 200 results anymore, the webUI will display all results now, but only 20 at a time as you might have seen in larger sites offering search results display&#8230;</p>
<p>We collected attributes which are most likely relevant for people searching for packages. For example, we gather the linkcount of a package into the database (so far only the backend knows what is a link and what is a plain package). The idea is to move links down in the source results.</p>
<p>Coming back to the kernel example, the kernel-source package is the <em>real</em> package, while kernel-default, kernel-desktop, kernel-xen, &#8230;. exist too but are all links to kernel-source. So it is fair to present kernel-source first.</p>
<p>Problem is: there are still 228 kernel-source packages in the build service (yes, people like branching the kernel &#8211; a lot), so the number of links pointing <strong>to</strong> the package is another attribute. Packages that other packages branch go up in the list while the resulting branches move down. What also plays a role in the calculation: is a package the devel package of another? (which is the final punch to have Kernel:HEAD/kernel-source as <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;search_text=kernel&amp;commit=Senden&amp;issue_tracker=bnc&amp;issue=&amp;project=0&amp;project=1&amp;package=0&amp;package=1&amp;name=0&amp;name=1&amp;title=0&amp;description=0&amp;attrib_type_id=" target="_blank">first result displayed</a>, as opposed to the old searching algorithm displaying a discontinued &#8220;linux-kernel-nutshell&#8221; as shown in the screen shots).<br />
<a href="https://build.opensuse.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;search_text=kernel&amp;commit=Senden&amp;issue_tracker=bnc&amp;issue=&amp;project=0&amp;project=1&amp;package=0&amp;package=1&amp;name=0&amp;name=1&amp;title=0&amp;description=0&amp;attrib_type_id="><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/search-kernel.gif" alt="search for kernel on OBS" width="688" height="406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9872" /></a></p>
<p>To sort the vast majority of results that are all _links, not linked to and not devel packages, we take the activity index. This is a number the OBS tracks for every package, but is nowhere displayed. It goes from 0 to 100 and goes down with time and goes up with regular commits. So if you look for kde, you will actually see KDE:Unstable:Playground as first project to match. This is because of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>kde is indeed a very bad search term</li>
<li>the unstable playground sees a lot of commits, so your chance of getting something fresh there is the highest</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your feedback wanted</h2>
<p>Of course nobody is perfect, and while the code of Ancor is close to, the weights given to the attributes were my choice, so all problems in the sorting you see are my fault. Please take some time and redo some <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/search" target="_blank">searches</a> you might have done in the past and report if the results are sane to your experienced eye. Within the HTML of the search results is a hidden span with the raw attributes used in the calculation, so if you find something strange, look for weight, linked_count, activity_index, is_devel and co. Possibly the package that looks bogus to you in the top results is just very active.</p>
<p>Depending on the feedback we get, we might need to change the weights or add yet more attributes in the search and ranking. Do your own experiments on <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/search" target="_blank">build.opensuse.org</a> today!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://michal.hrusecky.net/" target="_blank">Michal &#8220;|Miska|&#8221; Hrusecky</a> writes this week about the openSUSE release process. He gave a <a href="https://conference.opensuse.org/osem/conference/osc2013/proposal/77">talk about this subject</a> at the openSUSE conference this year and the content of this talk is reproduced below (the marketing section, just like with the presentation, is by <a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com" target="_blank">Jos Poortvliet</a>).</p>
<h2>Release Process</h2>
<p>To get openSUSE out is a lot of work. We already shared part of what we are doing to <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/06/13/keeping-factory-in-shape/">keep Factory rolling</a>. But as you can guess, there is much more to it. But let&#8217;s pretend it is a simple three-step process:</p>
<h3>Step one: developing Factory</h3>
<p>When release openSUSE, we immediately start working on the next version: a never ending story. First thing that happens during a new release cycle is coolo announcing the road map. This is the schedule of the release and important checkpoints that we have to reach on our way. After the release Factory (our development version) is not frozen anymore and people can start submitting new stuff. Usually they go crazy and submit a lot of bleeding edge and experimental packages and quite some parts of Factory will get broken.</p>
<p>Now comes the time for <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2013/06/13/keeping-factory-in-shape/">keeping Factory rolling</a>. As one picture can say more than thousand words, take a look at how packages get into factory:</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/factory.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/factory-1024x462.png" alt="factory" width="700" height="350" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9834" /></a></p>
<p>A developer creates a package in his home repository and then sends it to the devel project where it get&#8217;s some basic review (depends on how the team is setup there). From there, package goes to the factory, where are several automatic checks (will mention them later) and manual review by review team. Once the package passes all these checks, it gets into Factory. And breaks something else there. So somebody has to branch it, fix it, and go through the same process now with a different package&#8230;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re working on documenting the Factory development process in a little more detail so you can expect a blog on that subject in the coming months!</p>
<h4>Checking up on you&#8230;</h4>
<p>There are several bots that check packages send to Factory. First is <i>factory-auto</i>, which does some basic checks regarding you spec file, rpmlint warnings and similar. If you pass this quick test, it&#8217;s time for more thorough testing. A bot named <i>factory-repo-checker</i> tries to actually install your package in a testing environment to make sure it is possible and it also looks for possible file conflicts, so you wouldn&#8217;t overwrite somebody elses package. Last check before a package gets in front of the review team is <i>legal-auto</i>. This one checks the licence (did it change? is it a new package?) and if needed calls in our legal team to take a look at the package. The final step is manual review by members of review team which will try to spot mistakes that automatic checks overlook.</p>
<h3>Step two: freezing</h3>
<p>We could be breaking and fixing stuff forever, but as we have to release at some point we have to do some freezes. First one is the <i>Toolchain Freeze</i>. When we reach that, no new version of compilers will get in, only fixes. This way the rest can fix all the new compiler warning and errors without fear of getting new ones. Next in the line is <i>Base System Freeze</i> which means frozen kernel, KDE, Gnome, X11 and bellow&#8230; All these are core components with many packages depending on them. The rest of packages (after getting fixed/upgraded) gets frozen last with release of Beta 1 when we reach <i>Full Feature Freeze</i>. At that point only fixes go in, no new versions and features or anything else that could break anything.</p>
<h3>Step three: branching and selecting an ISO</h3>
<p>As we get close to the release, Factory gets branched into separate repository, currently 13.1. Factory then gets unfrozen and starts to live it own life again. The newly born release goes through the last stabilization and deep testing phase (both manual and through <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2013/06/06/openqa-in-opensuse/" target="_blank">openQA</a>). Every automatically build iso gets tested until the <i>Gold Master</i> is selected. Gold Master has to be installable andcannot contain any critical <em>ship stopper bugs</em>. It still can contain known bugs, we would never release if we would wait for bug free release. But all these bugs can be fixed via updates and some of them will even get fixed before official release date. After selecting <i>Gold Master</i> it takes us usually about a week to get it synchronized to our mirrors and to get everything ready for the big day. In that time, developers keeps fixing bugs and when you get our fresh release, we already have many fixes ready and waiting.</p>

<h2>Marketing process</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk release marketing now. We&#8217;ve got a HUGE list of things we work on in the marketing team.</p>
<h3>Building excitement</h3>
<p>There is preparation for the release, stuff we do usually in the 2 months before the release. Think about material like the release counters, posters and badges for on websites or at conferences; writing the sneak peek articles and organizing release parties.</p>
<h3>Releasing openSUSE</h3>
<p>Then there is the release marketing itself. We write a feature guide, extract feature highlights, create screen shots, write announcements for our news site and for the press. Then we put all of the above, combined with a list of people to be interviewed and a link to the gold master into a press kit we send one week before the release to journalists. This way we can have reviews published on the release date.<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/braindump.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/braindump-300x162.png" alt="the braindumptruck" width="300" height="162" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9831" /></a></p>
<h3>How it all comes about</h3>
<p>All that is essentially build upon the list of new features for openSUSE. We gather the developers&#8217; brain dumps at <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Major_features">this wiki page</a>. They share with us a bullet list of what changed <em>since the previous release</em> and <em>how important it is for their users</em>.</p>
<h4>Pirates</h4>
<p>We take these features to a pirate pad and start looking for everything that is missing (which, usually, is a lot: much of the features we don&#8217;t know about because developers don&#8217;t tell us). We gather info from the sites of projects like KDE and GNOME about their new versions and put it in. We work on the bullet points to make pretty text and we try to bring in some structure.</p>
<p>Once it is reasonably complete, we move it to a wiki page where we start to polish it up and add screenshots, links and video&#8217;s if we have em. The end result you are probably familiar with: <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Features">the Features page</a>. Note that most of this does not really need much experience, almost anybody can help!<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Featureguide.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Featureguide-300x198.png" alt="Feature guide writing process" width="300" height="198" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9837" /></a></p>
<h4>Highlighting</h4>
<p>Then the next step is to look at that draft and the structure it has gotten and put in some deep thinking to pick the major features for the highlights. There is a lot of whiteboarding in this step: figuring out what the message of our release is, the theme, that is not easy.</p>
<p>These are the main part of the announcement and everything else, which is then &#8216;just&#8217; hard work &#8211; a lot of it. This step needs the most experienced writing and a lot of feedback-improvement-feedback-improvement cycles.</p>
<h3>Timeline: work gets crazy at Beta</h3>
<p>The biggest problem with all this is that it can&#8217;t be done in a very relaxed way because we&#8217;re in a hurry. Beta 1 is about 6 weeks before we have the Goldmaster! When the Goldmaster is done, we need to send our stuff out to the press. At that point we can make only VERY minor changes. After all &#8211; just a week later we do the release. In that week, we only write social media messages (and translations) and get our websites, servers and everything else in order. Marketing is ready for the release!</p>
<h2>Releasing a conclusion</h2>
<p>We hope the above gives some sense of how the openSUSE release process works. Yes, it is long, laborious, but also <em>a lot of fun</em>! And of course it results in the awesome operating system which is <a href="http://software.opensuse.org">openSUSE</a>!</p>
