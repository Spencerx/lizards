				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently decided to do all my work in emacs and even though the learning speed is a bit slow, I thought I would share what I discoverd regarding editing the KIWI config files. Kiwi has the schema file for the elements and their attributes but unfortunately by default Emacs is unaware of it&#8217;s schema location. So first create a schema location file as below and save it.<br />
<code><br />
&lt;locatingRules xmlns="http://thaiopensource.com/ns/locating-rules/1.0"&gt;<br />
&lt;transformURI fromPattern="*.xml" toPattern="*.rnc"/&gt;</code></p>
<p>&lt;uri pattern=&#8221;*.kiwi&#8221; typeId=&#8221;KIWI&#8221;/&gt;<br />
&lt;typeId id=&#8221;KIWI&#8221; uri=&#8221;/usr/share/kiwi/modules/KIWISchema.rnc&#8221;/&gt;<br />
&lt;/locatingRules&gt;</p>
<p>I saved it as $HOME/.emacs.d/data/myschemas.xml. Now add this to your Emac&#8217;s init file for autoloading the nxml mode for kiwi files in addition to the xml files<br />
<code><br />
(setq auto-mode-alist<br />
(cons '("\\.\\(xml\\|kiwi\\|xsl\\|rng\\|xhtml\\)\\'" . nxml-mode)<br />
auto-mode-alist))<br />
</code><br />
and add this code for nxml mode to locate the kiwi schema file when you edit a kiwi config file<br />
<code><br />
(eval-after-load 'rng-loc<br />
'(add-to-list 'rng-schema-locating-files (concat user-emacs-directory "data/myschemas.xml")))<br />
</code><br />
Now have fun with Emacs, Kiwi and your openSUSE</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <strong>matryoshka doll</strong>, also known as a <strong>Russian nesting doll</strong> or a <strong>babushka doll</strong>, is a set of dolls of decreasing sizes placed one inside the other. A set of matryoshkas consists of a wooden figure which separates, top  from bottom, to reveal a smaller figure of the same sort inside, which  has, in turn, another figure inside of it, and so on. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll"><img class="alignright" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/First_matryoshka_museum_doll_open.jpg" alt="Matryoshka Doll" width="500" height="352" /></a></p>
<p>Virtualization is a concept similar to the Matryoshka analogy. There is another system running inside the host machine. So it is box in a box. There are many virtualization techniques available at the disposal of the user; <a href="http://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank">vmware</a>,<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank"> virtualbox</a>, <a href="http://www.xen.org/" target="_blank">xen</a> to name a few which requires lots of resources. Another alternative which is <a href="http://wiki.openvz.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">OpenVZ</a> , container-based virtualization for Linux. Each container performs and executes exactly like a stand-alone server;  a container can be rebooted independently and have root access, users,  IP addresses, memory, processes, files, applications, system libraries  and configuration files.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from <a title="Introducing Linux Virtual Containers" href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/opensource/?p=1289&amp;tag=leftCol;post-1299" target="_blank">TechRepublic Blog :</a></p>
<blockquote><p>In the past we have looked at using <a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/opensource/?p=615" target="_blank">OpenVZ for container virtualization</a> on Linux. OpenVZ is great as it allows you to run compartmentalized  “servers” within an operating system so you can separate systems, much  like running virtual machines on a host system. With OpenVZ, you can get  the benefits of virtualization without the overhead.</p>
<p>The downside of OpenVZ is that it isn’t in the mainline kernel. This  means you need to run a kernel provided by the OpenVZ project. By itself  this isn’t necessarily a problem, unless you are running an unsupported  Linux distribution, and also if you don’t mind a bit of lag from  upstream security fixes</p></blockquote>
<p>So what is an alternative; well maybe lxc is the answer.According to <a title="Linux Containers" href="http://lxc.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://lxc.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The  container  technology  is actively being pushed into the mainstream  linux kernel. It provides the resource management through the control  groups aka process containers and resource isolation through the  namespaces.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is very little information regarding LXC in the opensuse wiki and the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/LXC" target="_blank">only one available</a> is still draft, yet provides enough information to start rolling up your containers.  Here is the preamble of the above mentioned page:</p>
<blockquote><p>LXC is a form of paravirtualization. Being a sort of super duper  chroot jail, it is limited to running linux binaries, but offers  essentially native perfomance as if those binaries were running as  normal processes right in the host kernel. Which in fact, they are.</p>
<p>LXC is interesting primarily in that:</p>
<ul>
<li> It can be used to run a mere application, service, or a full operating system.</li>
<li> It offers essentially native performance. A binary running as  an LXC guest is actually running as a normal process directly in the  host os kernel just like any other process. In particular this means  that cpu and i/o scheduling are a lot more fair and tunable, and you get  native disk i/o performance which you can not have with real  virtualization (even Xen, even in paravirt mode) This means you can  containerize disk i/o heavy database apps. It also means that you can  only run binaries that the host kernel can execute. (ie: you can run  Linux binaries, not another OS like Solaris or Windows)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The same page also states there is not another HOWTO or documentation explaining how to use lxc with opensuse even though the lxc package has been part of the main oss repo since 11.2 version. Furthermore there are no scripts like lxc-fedora or lxc-debian  that will automate the creation or installation of opensuse. Now while it may be true that there are no opensuse specific scripts are available (at least I could not find through a Google search), though there is an interesting video on<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4S2_SaK9Bg0" target="_blank"> youtube showing the lxc with opensuse 11.2. </a></p>
<p>Based on the the information on the<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/LXC" target="_blank"> LXC</a> wiki page, using the  <a href="http://susestudio.com/" target="_blank">SUSEStudio</a> , I built an appliance which  is almost ready to use lxc. In order to create a container image, a very primitive lxc_opensuse script that will do a fairly basic job is also included. Once the script is issued,it will download opensuse 11.3 base system and the user can start playing with the wonders of lxc. For the impatient, who wants do discover Matryoshka, <a href="http://susegallery.com/a/4dMNWp/matryoshka" target="_blank">here is the link for  the appliance</a> .</p>
<p>Have fun with <strong><em>Matryoshka</em></strong> !</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For long I had been using my old laptop for everything; building images with KIWI, writing documents using LaTeX and Docbook XML, sorting my photos with Digikam. I have been upgrading since version 9.0 and at the moment opensuse 11.1 was the release ( OK with lots of new software thanks to the Build server. However, for some odd reason I wanted to have something new. Dangerous word, new is.</p>
<p>I have 2 Intel Atom&#8217;s running for my mail and web servers and I was quite happy with their performances, (by the way I am still happy). Hence I decided to ride the change train and bought the Intel D510 board</p>
<p>opensuse 11.3 Kde LiveCd worked fine and using Susestudio I designed my image. So far was really good. Booting the usb brought my feet back to earth. A frozen screen. So I tried the failsafe option and I had a 800X600 display. Reboot and this time trying &#8220;nomodeset&#8221; option same thing. Nevertheless I decided to give it a go ( I can always use it at run level 3).</p>
<p>Last night I have decided to include the Kernel:HEAD repo so I am using kernel-default-2.6.36-rc6.25.1.x86_64 along with the X11:XOrg repos using X.Org 1.9.0.901 (1.9.1 RC 1) so now I have &#8220;1366&#215;768 (the max my monitor can give) and I do not need to set &#8220;nomodeset&#8221; in the boot options anymore.</p>
<p>I have not tweaked everything yet, like my Logitech keyboard&#8217;s multimedia keys are useless in KDE at the moment.  At the end they will work one way or the other, I am sure.</p>
<p>Lesson Learned: do your homework well before jumping the change train or enjoy the adventures</p>
