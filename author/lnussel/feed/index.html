				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When starting a WSL distribution for the first time, a text prompt for user name and password appears:</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wsl-u.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14137" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wsl-u-300x52.png" alt="" width="300" height="52" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wsl-u-300x52.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wsl-u-768x133.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wsl-u.png 769w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The code for that is partially in the Windows launcher. The Windows side actually prompts for the user name:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL-DistroLauncher/blob/master/DistroLauncher/DistroLauncher.cpp#L44">https://github.com/microsoft/WSL-DistroLauncher/blob/master/DistroLauncher/DistroLauncher.cpp#L44</a></p>
<p>and passes it to &#8216;adduser&#8217;:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL-DistroLauncher/blob/1f8551f7e2ea22bba2e6fb02f01e7a5f7fb757f3/DistroLauncher/DistributionInfo.cpp#L14">https://github.com/microsoft/WSL-DistroLauncher/blob/1f8551f7e2ea22bba2e6fb02f01e7a5f7fb757f3/DistroLauncher/DistributionInfo.cpp#L14</a></p>
<p>That seems to be a Debian specific tool that also prompts for a password. We don&#8217;t have it in openSUSE. When done, the Windows part actually calls into the Linux environment again with &#8216;id -u&#8217; to get the uid of the added user:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL-DistroLauncher/blob/1f8551f7e2ea22bba2e6fb02f01e7a5f7fb757f3/DistroLauncher/DistributionInfo.cpp#L44">https://github.com/microsoft/WSL-DistroLauncher/blob/1f8551f7e2ea22bba2e6fb02f01e7a5f7fb757f3/DistroLauncher/DistributionInfo.cpp#L44</a></p>
<p>So in order to also prompt for the password we&#8217;d have to write a wrapper like the Debian one or implement another prompt in the launcher. Implementing such a prompt in Windows code seems boring to me. When writing a wrapper, I&#8217;d do something dialog based to make it look more fancy. There&#8217;s already <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/jeos-firstboot">jeos-firstboot</a> that does something similar already and more. But then the WSL image doesn&#8217;t have to be really minimal, which means we have YaST!</p>
<p>So even though WSL doesn&#8217;t really boot as it has no systemd it would be still possible to run the YaST firstboot wizard on first start. What modules it launches is configurable via xml file. So leaving out hardware/VM specific things like network configuration it works pretty well:</p>

<p>For the launcher to know the name of the created user a small <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/Virtualization:WSL/yast2-firstboot-wsl/firstboot_write_wsl.rb?expand=1">YaST module</a> was needed to write the name into /run/wsl_firstboot_uid. The launcher fetches it from there.</p>
<p>Using the YaST firstboot wizard also allows to use e.g. the existing registration dialogs on SLE or add other useful configuration steps. One feature I have in mind would be for example is the role selection screen to offer some pre defined package selections for WSL use cases.</p>
<p>Tumbleweed and Leap appx files to test this are available from <a href="https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/WSL/">download.opensuse.org</a>. Keep in mind that one needs to <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/WSL/Manual_Installation">import the certificates</a> used by OBS for signing first.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fundamental concept of all openSUSE packages as well as any image offered for download is a fully transparent, reproducible and automatic build and development process based on sources.</p>
<p>In openSUSE developers do not perform manual builds on some specially crafted machine in their basement and then upload the result somewhere. Instead all sources are stored in a version control system inside the <a href="https://openbuildservice.org/">open build service</a> (OBS) instance at <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/">build.opensuse.org</a>. OBS then automatically builds the sources including all dependencies according to defined build instructions (eg spec files for rpms). OBS also automatically adds cryptographic signatures to files that support it to make sure nobody can tamper with those files.</p>
<p>The WSL appx files are basically zip files that contain a tarball of a Linux system (like a container) and a Windows exe file, the so called launcher. Building a container is something OBS can already do fully automatic by means of <a href="http://osinside.github.io/kiwi/">Kiwi</a>. The launcher as well as the final appx however is typically built on a Windows machine using Visual Studio by the developer.</p>
<p>Since the goal of the openSUSE WSL offering is to have the appx files officially and automatically be produced along with other images such as the DVD installer, Live images or containers, the appx files have to be built from sources in OBS.</p>
<p>Fortunately there&#8217;s already a <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> cross toolchain <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/windows:mingw:win64">packaged as rpms OBS</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/facebook/fb-util-for-appx">tool to generate appx files on Linux</a>.</p>
<p>Combining that all together OBS can actually build the WSL appx from sources. The current state of development can be found in the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Virtualization:WSL">Virtualization:WSL</a> project in OBS. The generated appx files are published on <a href="https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/WSL/">download.opensuse.org</a>.<br />
The current images for <a href="https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/WSL/openSUSE_Leap_15.2/openSUSE-Leap-15.2-Alpha.appx">Leap 15.2 Alpha</a> and <a href="https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization:/WSL/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/openSUSE-Tumbleweed.appx">Tumbleweed</a> there are good enough for some testing already so please go ahead and do so, feedback welcome!<br />
Note that since the appx files are signed by OBS rather than Microsoft, there are a <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/WSL/Manual_Installation">few steps required</a> to install them.</p>
<p>Going forward there is still quite some work needed to polish this up. Kiwi for example can&#8217;t build the appx directly itself but rather the fb-util-for-appx is called by a spec file. That requires some hacks with the OBS project config to work. On Linux side there&#8217;s currently no password set for the root user, so we need a better &#8220;first boot&#8221; solution. More details on that in a later article. Meanwhile, remember to have a lot of fun&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day Richard described in his <a title="Richard's blog" href="https://sysrich.co.uk/?p=303">blog</a> how how he used openQA to test drive Fedora. Around the same time I read about <a href="http://www.android-x86.org/">Android x86</a> and saw that they offer iso images for download. So I wondered how hard it would be to get that one tested in openQA.<br />
<span id="more-11153"></span><br />
To find out I <a href="http://www.suse.de/~lnussel/setupgrubfornfsinstall.html">installed</a> a current <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</a> snapshot in qemu. Installing openQA in the VM is straight forward with the provided packages, following the instrucutions at <a href="https://github.com/os-autoinst/openQA">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that nested virtualization needs to be turned on to be able to run the openQA worker inside qemu (pass nested=1 to kvm_intel resp kvm_amd). To conveniently access the web interface, vnc and ssh I added &#8220;-net&#8221; &#8220;user,hostfwd=tcp::8888-:80,hostfwd=tcp::5091-:5091,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22&#8221; to the qemu command line.</p>
<p>As soon as openQA is up and running the remaining steps are easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>add the sample Android test cases I created:
<pre>
# cd /var/lib/openqa/tests
# git clone -b android-4.4 git://github.com/lnussel/os-autoinst-distri-android.git android-4.4
# chown geekotest android-4.4/needles
</pre>
</li>
<li>import the job templates so openQA learns what to do with Android iso images
<pre>
# android-4.4/templates
</pre>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.android-x86.org/download">Download android-x86-4.4-r2.iso</a> and store it in /var/lib/openQA/factory/iso</li>
<li>register the iso image with openQA:
<pre>
# /usr/share/openqa/script/client isos post \
    ISO=android-x86-4.4-r2.iso \
    DISTRI=android VERSION=4.4 ARCH=i586 \
    FLAVOR=live BUILD=0002
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Voilà! If everything went right openQA should now have created a job and the worker should start processing it.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots and a video of my test run:<br />
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openqa-android-02.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openqa-android-02-300x169.png" alt="openqa-android-02" width="300" height="169" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11155" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openqa-android-02-300x169.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openqa-android-02-1024x578.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openqa-android-02.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openqa-android-01.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openqa-android-01-300x183.png" alt="openqa-android-01" width="300" height="183" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11154" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openqa-android-01-300x183.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openqa-android-01-1024x625.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openqa-android-01.png 1126w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><br />
<div style="width: 640px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-11153-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/ogg" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openqa-android.ogv?_=1" /><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openqa-android.ogv">//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/openqa-android.ogv</a></video></div></p>
<p>Looks like the emulator in the Android SDK is also qemu based. So theoretically it shouldn&#8217;t be hard to integrate that one into openQA in order to actually test on emulated phones as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The German company rh-tec offers free IPv6 internet connections for people that already have T-DSL. Configuring such a connection on openSUSE 11.3 is not as straight forward as with IPv4. It&#8217;s not hard either if you know where to put the settings though.</p>
<ol>
<li>start the yast2 DSL module</li>
<li>follow the instructions of the wizard to set up a new PPPoE device. Enter your user name and password at the provider screen.</li>
<li>At the &#8220;Connection Parameters&#8221; screen uncheck &#8220;Automatically Retrieve DNS&#8221;. Enter an arbitrary IPv4 address as first DNS server (yast doesn&#8217;t accept IPv6 there yet, bug 665516).</li>
<li>finish the wizard and leave yast</li>
<li>open /etc/sysconfig/network/providers/provider0 (or whatever name was chosen by yast) in an editor</li>
<li>change DNS1 and DNS2 to the actual IPv6 addresses of your provider&#8217;s name servers</li>
<li>add the following line to the file:<br />
	<code>PPPD_OPTIONS="noip +ipv6 ipv6cp-accept-local"</code>
	</li>
<li>save and quit</li>
<li>Done! You may now use cinternet or qinternet to dial in and enjoy the (rather empty) IPv6 internet.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In addition to supporting file system capabilities (<a href="https://features.opensuse.org/307254">fate#307254</a>) I&#8217;ve also updated the permissions handling in 11.4 slightly.</p>
<p>There have been complaints that every SuSEconfig run also calls SuSEconfig.permissions which leads to changed file permissions at unexpected times. Therefore I&#8217;ve modified SuSEconfig.permissions to only actually set permissions when called explicitly (ie SuSEconfig &#8211;module permissions). When called by a generic SuSEconfig run SuSEconfig.permissions now only shows files with wrong permissions but doesn&#8217;t actually fix them anymore.</p>
<p>Since packages that have files with special permission handling do call SuSEconfig.permissions explicitly via %run_permissions in %post the change above alone isn&#8217;t sufficient to avoid surprises. Therefore I&#8217;ve introduced the new macro <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_Conventions_RPM_Macros#.25set_permissions">%set_permissions</a>. This macro expects file names as arguments. Only permissions of those files are adjusted then. To notify packagers of that new method an rpmlint check now issues an informal message if %run_permissions is used.</p>

I couldn&#8217;t resist to try the script he was using myself. It turned<br />
out that the script was extremly slow, it took about 15 minutes for<br />
the calculation on my computer. The script was originally written a<br />
long time ago for the old autobuild with a much lower number of<br />
packages and dependencies to take care of. The ad-hoc method used<br />
for the &#8216;rebuild simulation&#8217; just didn&#8217;t scale well. Hackweek was a<br />
good opportunity to improve the performance and to add some more<br />
options.<br />
<span id="more-4447"></span><br />
The improved script now simply uses a boring, standard depth first<br />
search to prepare the dense dependency graph for the simulation run.<br />
After that step running simulations on the data is a piece of cake.<br />
Overall the improved script now takes about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Originally the script assumed an infinite number of build hosts ie<br />
maximal parallelism. That&#8217;s a good method for visualizing the<br />
bottlenecks. In reality the number of build hosts is limited though.<br />
So I&#8217;ve added options to run the simulation with a fixed number of<br />
build hosts and different algorithms to choose which package needs<br />
to be built next. By using the script in a loop it&#8217;s even possible<br />
to produce an animation:<br />
<img width="1000" height="450" src="http://www.suse.de/~lnussel/rebuild_factory.gif" alt="rebuild animation" /><br />
The image shows the amount of blocked, scheduled and currently<br />
building packages at each point in time</p>
<p>Source code is available at <a href="http://gitorious.org/opensuse/mkdiststats">gitorious</a> if you want to try it out yourself.<br />
You need an account in the openSUSE build service as mkdiststats<br />
uses osc to download dependency information.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you have to enter user name and password to establish a link with<br />
your wireless network? If so chances are good that WPA2 Enterprise<br />
with EAP-TTLS or PEAP are used. Sounds familiar? Better check your<br />
setup then. An attacker might easily impersonate your access point<br />
and steal your password if the client you are using isn&#8217;t configured<br />
properly.<br />
You are likely vulnerable if you&#8217;ve disabled certificate checks<br />
or you&#8217;ve checked some button to use a public CA but didn&#8217;t specify<br />
any &#8220;Subject&#8221; or &#8220;Common Name&#8221; that has to match. NetworkManager for<br />
example doesn&#8217;t even allow to enter the latter.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday i noticed that openal-soft on 11.2 is broken, it just locks up with current pulseaudio. It&#8217;s not surprising noone noticed as there are no packages in Factory that use it anymore. Even Chromium BSU which roughly has a 0% chance that it will ever need maintenance, security or otherwise was dropped from Factory and moved to the build service games dumpsi^Wrepo. Please, put your packages back to Factory. Chances that people find and use the software are much bigger if the distro has it rather than some random build service repo. Yes, there are some rules you have to follow then but that&#8217;s also a sign of quality for our users. Yes, it won&#8217;t be the latest and greatest version always but that doesn&#8217;t matter for most packages. So please put your packages back to Factory [unless they are full of security bugs ;-)], a distro without packages is not useful.</p>

It now starts with a main window by default instead of<br />
directly going to the system tray. There&#8217;s a settings dialog that<br />
allows to enable the system tray icon and optionally also enables<br />
starting the applet on log-in. Furthermore the daemon now uses<br />
PolicyKit for access control and the applet supports i18n.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you got that shiny new Netbook, installed Linux on it and carry<br />
it along everywhere you go. The default enabled Firewall blocks<br />
incoming traffic so you feel safe when connecting to that anonymous<br />
WiFi network at your favorite fastfood restaurant. Unfortunately the<br />
very same Firewall becomes quite annoying at home where it prevents<br />
your system from discovering printers or blocks ssh.<br />
<span id="more-1453"></span><br />
You have the choice of either opening the ports permanently,<br />
exposing your system in hostile networks, or having to use sudo to<br />
enable or disable the Firewall. Well, not anymore with Firewall Zone<br />
Switcher! With that little applet you can now switch the zone of<br />
your network interface to &#8216;internal&#8217; with only two mouse clicks when<br />
you are at home. In an untrusted Network you just set the zone to<br />
&#8216;external&#8217;. And if you need some custom configuration you could set<br />
the zone &#8216;dmz&#8217; to have some open some ports or create a custom zone.</p>
<p>Firewall Zone Switcher is *not* meant to be some kind of &#8216;Personal<br />
Firewall&#8217; that confuses the user with all kinds of low level stuff.<br />
It&#8217;s neither a Firewall configuration tool. That job is still left<br />
to Admin tools like YaST. Firewall Zone Switcher settings are<br />
temporary and are reset to the system defaults on reboot.</p>
<p>Firewall Zone Switcher consist of a DBus service and a system<br />
tray applet. Both are written in python currently to have proof of<br />
concept program quickly. Packages are available from the <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/ymp/home:lnussel:fwzs/openSUSE_11.1/fwzs.ymp">openSUSE<br />
build service</a>. You also need to update SuSEfirewall2 from that<br />
repo. Source code repo is available at <a href="http://gitorious.org/opensuse/fwzs">gitorious</a>.<br />
Keep in mind that the app as well as the patch to SuSEfirewall2 are just proof<br />
of concept ie experimental so there will be bugs. Feedback welcome nevertheless<br />
