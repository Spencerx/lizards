				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our call to apply for the openSUSE Core Test Team end of July attract a great deal of attention. So we got applications from nearly 50 members out of the openSUSE community, much more than expected.</p>
<p>Caused by that large number of offers to move testing of openSUSE forward, we decided to increase the number of members for the new openSUSE Core Test Team from 15 to 25. A number that enables even more areas to be covered by the openSUSE Core Test Team.</p>
<p>Six weeks later &#8211; with the release of Milestone 7 of openSUSE 11.2 &#8211; the team is formed and already started his work to ensure that openSUSE will also be a rock-solid Linux distro in the future. First discussion about prioritizing tasks is already started and members of the team are planing their first real time meeting on IRC.<br />
<span id="more-2091"></span><br />
But everybody that is not (yet) part of the team is also able to take part in discussions of the openSUSE Core Test Team and contribute. The communication platform for the new team is the public opensuse-testing@opensuse.org mailing list (further information at <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Testing">http://en.opensuse.org/Testing</a>). And of course you don&#8217;t have to be part of the Core Test Team to help the openSUSE project with testing of Milestone 7 and later releases (which are available at <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/developer">http://software.opensuse.org/developer</a>).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m exited to see the team to carry the world before one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In addition to well-developed code, testing is a major part of ensuring a rock-solid openSUSE Linux distro. To make sure testing of openSUSE 11.2 (and beyond) are done in a well-organized way, we&#8217;re improving the way the openSUSE Core Test Team works together to ensure top quality for openSUSE.</p>
<p>In the next couple of days Milestone 4 of openSUSE 11.2 will be available. This is a very good moment to have a closer look into the next openSUSE release: some new features are already implemented and there is enough time to fix reported problems.</p>
<p>Thus we are looking for 15 members of the openSUSE Community that are willing to contribute to the openSUSE project by joining the openSUSE Core Test Team and operate in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if new features are implemented and working as requested</li>
<li>Have a deeper look into the install and update system of openSUSE and ensure a broad hardware coverage</li>
<li>Creating, improving and executing test cases for various areas of the distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>Repository for test cases and tracking system for all test results will be Testopia, the test case management extension of Novell&#8217;s Bugzilla. Members of the Core Test Team will get access to the openSUSE test plans and will so be able to contribute. Beside storing test results they are also able to create or modify test cases.</p>
<p>If you are really interested in joining the openSUSE Core Test Team and willing to spend a reasonable amount of time to move the openSUSE project forward please get in contact with Holger Sickenberg &lt;holgi at suse.de&gt; providing following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Linux experience</li>
<li>Previous testing experience, if any</li>
<li>Areas you are interested in testing</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of members is limited to 15 at the moment to ensure we are able to adequate support everyone of them. We will add more once we&#8217;ve figured out in the smaller group whether everything works.</p>
<p>Of course everybody is still able to contribute to the openSUSE project by testing parts of the distribution. Enabling the openSUSE Core Test Team will not have any impact on that. Further information on testing is available at <a href="http://www.opensuse.org/Testing">www.opensuse.org/Testing</a>.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to your application. Deadline for applications is August, 15th 2009.</p>
