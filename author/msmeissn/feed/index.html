		<description><![CDATA[Brief report on the Wine talk at LinuxTag 2011 in Berlin, by Christian Boltz and Marcus Meissner. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Christian Boltz and myself held a quite successful talk on Wine on the 2010 openSUSE conference, we decided to again hold a talk at Germanys largest Linux fair, Linux Tag 2011 in Berlin.</p>
<p>We again ran the pun talk &#8220;Wine&#8221; (not) the Emulator vs &#8220;Wine&#8221; the beverage, with Christian talking about life and work at a vineyard and his wine grower community at Deutsches Weintor.</p>
<p>Included in this talk was a Wine tasting of 4 different kinds of Wine, as grown in the area were Christian lives.</p>
<p>His stories on Vineyard activities and the processing from grape to wine interluded with myself talking about Wine the Emulator, its historical and statistical parts, game support and futures.</p>
<p>Around 70 people  enjoyed our light hearted wrap up talk of this Linux Tag conference.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I guess everyone notice, <a href="http://google.com/chrome/">Google</a> has released their own Browser called Chrome. Based on Webkit (based on KHTML of KDE fame) it is a small, fast and foremost secure webbrowser. And if you are reading this, you likely know that it does not work on Linux, but only on Windows.</p>
<p>But wait &#8230; we have the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Wine">Windows Emulator Wine</a> and I am one of its developers&#8230;</p>
<p>This also explains the first comment from a colleague on Wednesday morning was: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you have fixed Wine to run it yet?!?&#8221; We tried together to get the online installer to run, but not successful.</p>
<p>Over night however some other folks found out how to do it by using the offline installer.</p>
<p>So how to install Chrome:</p>
<p>1. Get the Wine 1.1.3 from the openSUSE buildservice Emulators:Wine repository.</p>
<p>   Its available via the Community Repositories Module in YAST2 on openSUSE 10.3 and 11.0,<br />
   after adding this repository upgrade the <i>wine</i> package.</p>
<p>   This piece of code run as root will do it on openSUSE 11.0:<br />
   <code>zypper sa http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine/openSUSE_11.0/ Wine<br />
   zypper in wine</code></p>
<p>   All other steps are done as desktop user from a regular shell.</p>
<p>2. Download the Chrome Offline Installer</p>
<p>    <code>wget http://gpdl.google.com/chrome/install/149.27/chrome_installer.exe</code></p>
<p>3. Install richedit native libraries.</p>
<p>    While Wine contains richedit libraries they are not yet up to the task to help Chrome yet.<br />
    (This is likely to be fixed soon.)</p>
<p>    To install them run:<br />
    <code>winetricks riched20 riched30</code></p>
<p>3. Run Chrome Installer</p>
<p>   <code>wine chrome_installer.exe</code></p>
<p>   This will popup a dialog where you can press return until Chrome itself starts. </p>
<p>   Since we need to supply Chrome with some Options to make it work with current Wine, you need<br />
   to close it again. Click anyway any crash messageboxes.</p>
<p>4. Run Chrome itself</p>
<p>   We need to supply Chrome with some additional commandline options to make it run with Wine,<br />
   so we need to do start it by hand (instead of clicking on the convenient Desktop Icon already there).</p>
<p>   <code>cd ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/profiles/*/*/*/Google/Chrome/Application<br />
   wine chrome.exe --new-http --in-process-plugins</code></p>
<p>5. Surf!</p>
<p>And of course the obligatory screenshot:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcusmeissner/2828814626/" title="chrome wine opensuse by Marcus Meissner, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3005/2828814626_f7a1ef106d_m.jpg" width="240" height="229" alt="chrome wine opensuse" /></a></p>
<p>Most of the funny workarounds above will actually vanish in the next Wine releases, now that the Wine developers can actively debug it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=13635">WineHQ Application database entry</a> has the ongoing discussion of getting it to work and links to the Wine bugzilla entries.</p>
