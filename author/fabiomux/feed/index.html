				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am happy to announce that i succeded in compiling wxRuby 2.0.1 on my Buildservice account and it is available to be installed in just one click for openSUSE 12.2 and 12.3.</p>
<p>wxRuby is an old but working library based on wxWidgets toolkit, till some day ago the dependency from SWIG 1.3.38 and some small errors raised during the manual compilation, made the use of this library the worst nightmare for beginners who was looking for a fast approach to GUI based programming in Ruby.</p>
<p>After some day spent to investigate about a possible upgrade of the SWIG dependency to the current 2.0 version, i produced some patches to fix this and the other annoying compiling errors, and finally, thanks to the Buildservice infrastructure, a wxRuby RPM compiled from sources with the relative patches are now availables for all openSUSE users!</p>
<p>As far i googled this should be the first distro to have a precompiled and working wxruby gem among its repositories (being compiled from sources the gem is generated for 32 and 64 bits architecture from Buildservice itself), so Rubyists take a look on software.opensuse.org, select the package coming from my home project account and enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who uses Ruby might be interested to try this interesting multiplatform library that allows the development of GUI (Graphic User Interface) with a considerable visual impact and compatible with the three most popular Operating Systems: Linux (via GTK) Windows (with Native controls) and OSX (via Aqua). (<a href="http://italiafreeware.byethost4.com/?q=node/145">This article is also available for italian users</a>)<br />
<span id="more-4532"></span></p>
<p>Usually need install the wxGTK libraries and the gem wxruby (or wxruby-ruby19 if using ruby 1.9) and start creating your own scripts.</p>
<p><code>$ sudo zypper in wxGTK wxGTK-gl<br />
$ sudo gem install wxruby</code></p>
<p>But sometimes we could find an Error for a wrong compatibilty between the installed version of the wxGTK libraries and the wrapper library included in the gem.</p>
<p><code>/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/wxruby-2.0.1-x86-linux/lib/wxruby2.so:<br />
symbol _ZN13wxAuiNotebook14ShowWindowMenuEv, version WXU_2.8.5 not defined in file libwx_gtk2u_aui-2.8.so.0 with link time reference -<br />
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/wxruby-2.0.1-x86-linux/lib/wxruby2.so</code></p>
<p>When an error like this appear, the unique solution is recompile the gem.</p>
<p>What we need:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>rubygems</strong>: Tool for manage the ruby&#8217;s gems;</li>
<li><strong>rake</strong>: the Ruby&#8217;s version of the popular <strong>make</strong>, will help us to compile wxRuby;</li>
<li><strong>wxGTK, wxGTK-gl, wxGTK-devel</strong>: Library and headers needed for run our scripts and produce the object&#8217;s file;</li>
<li><strong>SWIG</strong>: Build the wrapper classes in Ruby from the C++ sources, wxRuby 2.0.1 need the version 1.3.8;</li>
<li><strong>gcc-c++</strong>: The C++ compiler used for build the wrapper library;</li>
<li><strong>wxRuby</strong>: We have to download the source&#8217;s package directly from Rubyforge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Added the repository which contains the Ruby extensions (warning to the portion of the address that refers the version of openSUSE), we can proceed with the installation confirming the request of the dependent packages:</p>
<p><code>$ sudo zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/ruby:/extensions/openSUSE_11.3/ RubyExtensions<br />
$ sudo zypper ref<br />
$ sudo zypper install rubygems rubygem-rake gcc-c++ wxGTK-devel rubygem-ffi-swig-generator make</code></p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to download the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/swig/swig-1.3.38/swig-1.3.38.tar.gz/download">sources of SWIG version 1.3.38</a> from sourceforge, then uncompress and install it:</p>
<p><code>tar -xvf swig-1.3.38.tar.gz<br />
cd swig-1.3.38<br />
./configure &amp;&amp; make<br />
sudo make install</code></p>
<p>All the packages are ready, we have to set some environment variables before continue:</p>
<p><code>export SWIG_CMD=/usr/local/bin/swig<br />
export WXRUBY_EXCLUDED=GLCanvas<br />
export WXRUBY_VERSION=2.0.1</code></p>
<p>The second instruction is important for ignore all the references to the openGL library, which are not availables in unicode version.</p>
<p>The next step is download the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=35">wxRuby&#8217;s source</a> from Rubyforge and start to compile</p>
<p><code>tar -xvf wxruby-2.0.1.tar.gz<br />
cd wxruby-2.0.1<br />
rake</code></p>
<p>After this procedure end you can remove the old gem and build &amp; install the new:</p>
<p><code>rake gem<br />
sudo gem install wxruby-2.0.1-x86-linux.gem</code></p>
<p>Personally, I needed recompile wxRuby in openSUSE 11.2; with the new version (11.3) standard packages work fine, anyway i wished share my experience for someone could meet the same trouble in the future <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> )</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KDE 4 is definitively my daily desktop environment, although it&#8217;s not yet mature like the 3.5.x branch i consider it enough stable and usable, but sometime the default settings and the few time available, don&#8217;t help us to appreciate it, so let&#8217;s resume some little tip for beginners that feel lost with everything new and don&#8217;t want waste their time.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://italiafreeware.byethost4.com/?q=node/144" target="_blank">This article is also available for italian users</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want<strong> Delete/Move items over the panel</strong> click the Plasma icon in the right edge: a second panel will help you to insert other plasmoids, resize the panel, align it, activate the auto-hide, and plus will be enabled the drag&#8217;n drop over any item for change their positions</li>
<li>The <strong>Show Desktop icon</strong> is one of the most feature i use, unfortunately it&#8217;s hide between the other plasmoids and his place is taken from the <strong>Show Dashboard</strong>. If you need see quickly your desktop then right click over the panel and select <em>Panel Settings &gt; Add Object</em> then select <em>Windows and Tasks</em> and drag <em>Show Desktop</em> plasmoid over the panel. Add a key shortuct is easy: right click over the icon submitted and select <em>Show Desktop Settings</em> then click over the button and insert it (if <em>Win + D</em> sound more familiar you can use it too)</li>
<li><strong>Link your software over the main Panel or the Desktop</strong> with few steps: just search it into the main menu (<em>Alt + F1</em>) and drag&#8217;n drop over the Panel/Desktop. If a folder is dragged from Dolphin/Konqueror over the Desktop you may create, through the popup menu, a <em>Folder View</em>, a <em>Lancelot menu</em> or just an icon that will start a dolphin&#8217;s session</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t like the Plasma Desktop? Switch back to the old style just selecting the <strong>Folder View</strong> under <em>Desktop Settings &gt; Type</em></li>
<li>Everyone has just installed KDE 4 want see the <strong>Cube</strong> and probabily this effect it&#8217;s already activated through KWin, then press <em>CTRL + F11</em>, switch the faces with the <em>arrow keys</em> and select your desktop pressing <em>Return</em></li>
<li><strong>KSnapshot doesn&#8217;t popup with PrtScr</strong>? If you miss this feature<em>, </em> then fix it: launch <em>systemsettings</em>, select <em>Input Actions</em> and create a new global shortcut (Command/URL) into the tree list through the contextual menu, fill the multiline text field with a comment, set <em>PrtScr</em> as key, and insert the command <em>ksnapshot</em>, then save. With the  same system you can associate  your favorite software with  a combo key (think on it if you want launch<strong> dolphin</strong> with <em>Win + E</em> or <strong>kfind</strong> with <em>Win + F</em>)</li>
<li>The <strong>Grid View</strong> is something useful for watch and select any window opened in your desktop, try it with <em>Ctrl + F9</em> or <em>Ctrl + F10</em> if you want see the windows opened in every Desktop. This feature is also available for align the Desktops in the same view (<em>Ctrl + F8</em>)</li>
<li><strong>KDE 4 seem slow</strong>? Before say it try to disable some effect under <em>systemsettings &gt;</em> <em>Desktop</em>. Usually i disable the effects related to the windows minimization (slow redesign) and move (transparence), but if your system is very old, before to leave KDE 4 disable them completely</li>
<li><strong>How to show/hide the </strong><strong>invisible files</strong>? Both in Dolphin or Konqueror switch their visualization with <em>Alt + .</em></li>
<li><strong>Klipper</strong> improve the <strong>clipboard&#8217;s system</strong>: use <em>Ctrl + Alt + V</em> for paste one of the last ten, twenty,&#8230; items already copied, it support also the <em>actions</em> (<em>Ctrl + Alt + X</em> for enable/disable) configurables through regular expressions, they allow to open the string selected with a particular program. Try this feature selecting this: http://www.opensuse.org</li>
<li>Tired to navigate the main menu? <strong>Krunner</strong> can help you: call it with <em>Alt + F2</em> and begin to write in the text box a part of the application&#8217;s name you would like start and it will search the string between the whole menu. Krunner can also open a folder, search between contacts or bookmarks, convert units or execute little math operations, look <a href="http://userbase.kde.org/Tutorials/Krunner" target="_blank">the official page on KDE.org</a> for more details.</li>
<li>Some <strong>plasmoid</strong> look very useful, not only gadgets for fill your Desktop: webmaster should love the <strong>Color Picker</strong> and keep it fix in the main panel; the <strong>Timer</strong> will help us to manage our time counting down a configurable interval; <strong>Notes</strong> is a post-it system; <strong>Quick Access</strong> is another way to reach our files and folder and navigate between them directly from the main panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now, hope it help to enjoy a bit more this fantastic Desktop Environment, any new hint is welcome, just leave a comment below <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
