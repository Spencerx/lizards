				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>openSUSE 12.1 is on its way, and recently LXDE got some major updates.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m personally always been really satisfied of how LXDE works and is integrated into the openSUSE user experience, one defect though , that I&#8217;m really sorry about, is that i was never able to provide a very nice look&amp;feel.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not a graphic, and i realized I&#8217;m failing, i decide to ask your help now.</p>
<p>Here is what we need:</p>
<p>1) A gtk2 + openbox theme (including lxpanel background and icon theme)</p>
<p>2) A theme for lxdm (you can use /usr/share/lxdm/themes/Industrial as template), and eventually a background too</p>
<p>Also, i would like to open a contest. Your goal is create a logo for openSUSE-LXDE project.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have more information as soon as possible about this contest on the opensuse-lxde@o.o mailing list and here on lizards, please keep in mind that we want to print the winning logo on t-shirts too.</p>
<p>Up to date info about the contest will be available in the wiki <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:LXDE_Logo_Contest" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>I hope lot&#8217;s of you will help.</p>
<p>Andrea</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GTK3 will slowly replace the &#8220;old&#8221; gtk2, and of course, if we don&#8217;t want to be left behind we have to move to gtk3 eventually.</p>
<p>Even if <em>slowly </em>(we need horse power! &#8211;&gt; yes we need you too!!) LXDE is being ported too. Nothing has been released yet, but a good deal of work is actually into git repositories.</p>
<h3>X11:lxde:gtk3 project</h3>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://build.opensuse.org" target="_blank">openSUSE Build Service</a> (public instance of the <a href="http://openbuildservice.org/" target="_blank">Open Build Service</a>) we are currently able to get git code and build it auto-magically (thanks god you created obs _services <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />  )</p>
<p>Right now, only five packages don&#8217;t want to build with gtk3 and they are: <strong>gpicview, libfm, lxmusic, lxpanel, pcmanfm</strong>. Everything else builds fine. As a side note, lxdm gtk greeter build but seems to crasch.</p>
<p>Please test those packages and report in our mailing list or even better upstream your issues.</p>
<p>To conclude, right now i don&#8217;t feel comfortable to push into factory gtk3 packages, so 12.1 most probably will stuck with the well know stable gtk2 packages.</p>
<p>Also, i&#8217;m actually working to use obs, to provide gtk3 enabled git nightly build not only to openSUSE (actually only &gt;= 11.4) but also to<strong> Fedora 15</strong> (already building with many successful packages) and <strong>Ubuntu/Debian</strong>. So if you are .deb packagers, please let me know, i need your help. Contact me and the lxde team using our mailing list <strong>opensue-lxde@opensuse.org</strong></p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Andrea</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After announcing <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/07/23/opensuse-lxde-11-3-live-cd/" target="_blank">few days ago</a> the first beta of the openSUSE-LXDE live CD based on openSUSE 11.3, the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:LXDE" target="_blank">openSUSE-LXDE</a> <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:LXDE_team" target="_blank">team</a> is proud to announce the <strong>openSUSE-LXDE 11.3 RC1 Live-CD</strong>.</p>
<p>The isos finally fit into a CD, the sizes are 666MB for the 32bit version and 680MB for the 64bit version.</p>
<p>While the betas versions was into the 0.0.x series (0.0.1, 0.0.2, ecc), this RC and the next ones (if needed) will be into the 0.x.y series (0.1.0, 0.1.1, 0.2.0, ecc)</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide as soon as possible a stable release that will be 1.0.0.</p>
<p>Please help us, test this iso, report any missing/un-needed package you find, any bug or issue.</p>
<p>If none will be reported, most probably this configuration will be rebuilt as 1.0.0 and released to the public as STABLE.</p>
<p>Rember users <strong>root </strong>and <strong>linux </strong>has NO password.</p>
<p>The iso, as usal is hybrid and persistent, so if copied into a USB pendrive, at the first boot it will expand and create a read-write folder were you can save your datas.</p>
<p>Download as usual, is available under X11:lxde project here:</p>
<p><a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/lxde/images/iso/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/lxde/images/iso/</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi people,</p>
<p>I know lots of you was waiting for that, and i am really sorry if it took some time, but i can finally announce the first beta release for our 11.3 live cd.</p>
<p>It is still a beta and such as it have some flaws, like for example it doesn&#8217;t fit into a CD yet. The good news is that this is an hybrid and permanent iso, so you can use dd to copy the iso into your usb pendrive.</p>
<p>Please help us testing and reporting bugs and issues you find.</p>
<p>To download the isos, as usual browse here!</p>
<p><a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/lxde/images/iso/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/lxde/images/iso/</a></p>
<p>i believe i should be able to release new isos soon, i need to at least provide you isos able to fit into a cd!</p>
<p>Andrea</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am sure that most of you know and like <a href="http://www.acetoneteam.org/" target="_blank">acetoneiso2</a>, a nice tool to menage isos and lots of other things. Latest release, 2.2.1 support only kde, gnome and xfce as DE and allow to open their file managers to browse files and mounted stuffs&#8230;</p>
<p>So, you know, FLOSS is our world.. i took the code, and improved it, just a trivial change, but really nice. I added LXDE/PcmanFM support, as you can see from the picture:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/acetoneiso-lxde.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4251" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/acetoneiso-lxde-300x223.png" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>Now you can have acetoneiso2 run pcmanfm too.</p>
<p>The patched package is already into <a href="http://packman.links2linux.org/package/acetoneiso2" target="_blank">Packman</a> repository and a submit-request (<a href="https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/41069" target="_blank">#41069</a>) has been submitted to KDE:KDE4:Community repository, so hopefully, it would be available even there quite soon.</p>
<p>So people.. enjoy it <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
