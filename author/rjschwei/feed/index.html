				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, oSC13 has come and gone and what a great event to look back on. Starting with the pre-registration party on Thursday night all the way to the end on Monday the program was jam packed with interesting talks and workshops. All sessions were well attended and some were hopelessly over flowing.</p>
<p>The millions of thank you&#8217;s directed toward Kostas and Stella, the driving forces for the organization, are probably not enough. In addition to having a great event we also had the opportunity to learn a lot about what it takes to pull off oSC. Until oSC13 a lot of knowledge about the oSC organization was locked up within SUSE as the primary driving force of the conference organization in previous years. The &#8220;locking up&#8221; of information was just something that happened due to the nature of the organization of previous conferences. Information inside companies just gets lost, that&#8217;s the nature of the beast and this is certainly not intentional. Additionally, at least for me, having the community organized event this year made me think more about what it takes to pull off the organization. I guess with SUSE standing behind the event not just as a sponsor, but also as the lead organizer, it somewhat made the individuals that worked on the organization anonymous. We certainly had great conferences previously and many of us like to think back and reminisce about previous events when we meet. Another point is probably that one thinks that many more resources are brought to bare when a company is behind the organization of an event, although that is not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>Having the community drive the organization for oSC13 is just a completely different feeling, and I think I am not alone with this sentiment. The people that were involved in the organization of previous conferences were always happy to help and share information, and some were intimately involved in pulling things together, thank you.</p>
<p>The knowledge accumulated will certainly spread through the community and a number of meetings and many discussions at oSC13 started this process already. During the live project meeting, a.k.a. Town Hall meeting, it was my pleasure to announce that oSC14 will take place in Dubrovnik in April 2014. Svebor, the lead for the oSC14 organization endured a number of brain dumps and got bombarded with ideas and suggestions.</p>
<p>This conference paves the way for oSC to grow as a community organized event and I know that Stella and Kostas had to swallow more lumps, as the prime movers, than others in the future will have to. Thank you.</p>
<p>With somewhere around 250 attendees we all can be very proud of the first community organized oSC. For impressions check out some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/osc13">pictures of oSC13</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/openSUSEtv">the video recordings</a> of the sessions. Now is also a good time to seriously start thinking about your travel plans for April 2014. See you in Dubrovnik</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the risk of stepping on other people&#8217;s toes let me apologize before I start. I am certain we have many members in the community that have gone out of their way to overcome hurdles placed in their way by our &#8220;organization&#8221; or others. I was inspired by this story because it shows how dedicated our community members are and it really fits well with some of the issues we are still struggling with in the transition from Boosters to SUSE team and the transition between initiatives, Ambassadors to Coordinators and shipping of DVDs to boxes of promo material for designated events.</p>
<p>Peter Czanik was caught in the middle of all of this at a recent FSF conference where he and others had an openSUSE booth. With no DVDs being shipped, due to the transition in the promo material shipping procedure (this has been announced) and no money available through TSP for local production of marketing materials due to a snafu (a temporary solution is in the works) there was basically no help from the resources where help should be coming from, sorry about that Peter.</p>
<p>Despite these obstacles Peter and the team showed up and made due with what was available to have great success. In Peter&#8217;s words:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;"&#8221;<br />
<em>- distributed the last few remaining openSUSE 12.2 DVDs. Many people complained, that it&#8217;s not the latest and greatest, but also many were happy, as they have an old machine and older Linux versions usually have lower resource requirements.</em><br />
<em>- reused the posters we printed last autumn to decorate the booth (at the end of the day they were in a sorry state, so can&#8217;t be reused any more&#8230;)</em><br />
<em>- used the few remaining openSUSE brochures, stickers we printed last year (printing was contributed last year by somebody working at a printing company and our company printer&#8230;)</em></p>
<p><em>- used my ARM machines and a few borrowed mini PCs to demo openSUSE and make the booth eye catching (people asked about the machines and went away with openSUSE DVDs and brochures )</em></p>
<p><em>So, in short: last autumn we had local contributions from community members, this year we used what was last few bits of it and some creativity.</em></p>
<p><em>The good thing is, that I was told from multiple directions, that openSUSE had the best booth among software projects at the conference (and they did not know, that it was from a ZERO budget&#8230;).</em></p>
<p><em>The bad thing is, that we don&#8217;t have any marketing materials left. No DVDs, posters or brochures.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;"&#8221;"</p>
<p>There is no need to rose color the situation, leaving community members trying to represent openSUSE at a conference stranded like this should not happen and there is no excuse for creating this situation in the first place. Work is proceeding to address these issue. However, I want to focus on the positive, and that is undoubtedly how determined Peter and the team were to make the conference a success and how they overcame the obstacles presented to them.</p>
<p>Thank you Peter and team fro being such dedicated representatives of our community and project. Also thank you for pointing out the shortcomings in our current transition period. This will allow us to address these, hopefully in short order.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, am am certain many of you have similar stories to tell. Thanks for your efforts as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well openSUSE 12.3 is about to go live  and we are all pretty excited. It is, as far as I can tell a rock solid release and we have outdone ourselves. Considering the short release cycle makes this even more impressive.</p>
<p>One can only thank everyone in the community for pulling together, getting a lot of stuff done and delivering a great release.</p>
<p>Yet, there&#8217;s one sprinkle that rains on our parade. While we completed the switch to systemd we somewhere along the lines forgot to check the status of NetworkManager on an installed system. Thus, when you upgrade from a previous release and NetworkManager is disabled, it will be enabled and running after the upgrade is complete, sorry. If you happen to be running a network bridge your bridge will not be working and you&#8217;ll end up in some weird network state where <em>ifconfig</em> will tell you that both your bridge and your Ethernet card have an IP address. Your routing table will also be messed up. Addressing the issue is easy.</p>
<p>Login as root, which you will have to do at the login manager if you happen to run NIS, disable NetworkManager, stop the NetworkManager service, and restart your network. You are now back to your original configuration, no sweat <img src='http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  . Below is a list of commands you want to run as the root user to make this happen:</p>
<p># systemctl &#8211;force disable NetworkManager.service</p>
<p># systemctl stop NetworkManager.service</p>
<p># rcnetwork restart</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe it is just me, but lately it appears that there is a lot brewing on our lists. Generally I try to stay out of the fray, but of course we, as members of our community, are all in the middle of it in one way or another. With a very recent endless thread on the opensuse list fresh in memory, not that I read all or even most of the messages it generated, and the follow on thread of the original poster bidding his farewell to the list, supposedly because the poster didn&#8217;t like the responses, I feel compelled to share some of my own thoughts on the topic.</p>
<p>My feeling is that a good number of people that complain about the noise on our lists are also those that contribute to that noise at a good rate. Thus, I can only say that sometimes it is nice to exercise some restraint and not hit that &#8220;Send&#8221; button; who hasn&#8217;t had the &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have sent this&#8221; thought? The bottom line is, that it is almost impossible to write anything that does not step on somebody&#8217;s toes somewhere along the way and if everyone that feels the least bit uneasy about some comment would respond all the time we would really be in an endless loop. I am certain, this post will make someone uneasy, upset, angry or worse. If that&#8217;s the way you feel right now, I am sorry, I am not trying to make you angry or upset on purpose. Please accept my apology.</p>
<p>That said, who hasn&#8217;t been frustrated out of their mind by some perceived dumb software problem or other issue? Even worse when it is our own hurdle we cannot cross. In the end we just wanted to yell and scream and the result is too often a message with: pick your &#8220;Emotional state appropriate inflamatory subject&#8230;&#8221; and rant your question to the list. Everyone gets emotional, and frustration happens to be a very strong reaction. However, the question that should come to mind before hitting that &#8220;Send&#8221; button to a list of volunteers is this, &#8220;Will an emotional reaction with moaning, groaning, whining, and complaining, that hides the real problem, give me the feedback needed to resolve my issue?&#8221; The answer is simple; No it will not. A post charged with negative energy will, and there is plenty of proof on our lists, solicit emotional, mostly negative, responses. These do not contribute to resolving the problem at hand. However, once this storm is set in motion there is, for better or worse no stopping it and it just has to run its course, i.e. eventually people will be tired of feeding the storm that should have never happened and things will go back to &#8220;normal&#8221;, whatever that may be.</p>
<p>I believe that the people, volunteers, on the opensuse mailing lists are generally willing to help solve problems others encounter. Yes, there will be the occasional cynical remark here and there, but I do not believe these remarks are ushered in a mean spirited way, and in the end we do not really have to nit-pick everything to death. It is one thing to yell at someone because the product or service you purchased from them does not meet your expectations, it is another thing to go bananas on a list where answers are provided by people with generally good intentions that volunteer their time. As posters of questions we all have a responsibility to keep this in mind before we go down the emotionally charged road to the abyss of not getting our questions answered.</p>
<p>However, putting the onus completely on the question poster is a bit too easy, isn&#8217;t it. While we as helpers would all love to get the &#8220;perfect&#8221; problem description, that is completely factual and contains no mistakes in description and actions to reproduce the problem, we have to realize that this is just not going to happen. By the time an issue hits the list the person posting probably is charged up in one way or another and ready to get rid of some of that stored energy, some more than others. Thus, as helpers we have to develop a bit more tolerance and let things roll off our backs a bit more. As potential helper we can just ignore the ranting posters. If you have it within you to provide the answer to the hidden problem and can rise above the fray, fantastic! help and do a good deed. However, if you know the answer to the hidden problem but feel the urge to feed the emotional storm it may be best to just ignore the message and not respond. In the end a raging answer hides the kind deed of help just as the raging question hides the problem.</p>
<p>No we do not have to have boring and no fun lists, but in the end flame wars or endless bickering threads are not fun and having people leave the lists or even not using openSUSE because of silly things is just not helpful to anyone. If we as posters, seekers of answers and providers thereof can just tone it down a bit things will probably work better for everyone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Towards the end of last year there was an article in openSUSE news &#8220;announcing&#8221; the cloud efforts in the openSUSE project and on OBS. Well, cloud is still all the rage (see Jos&#8217; contribution to openSUSE News issue 180) and people just cannot stop talking about cloud computing.</p>
<p>Using openSUSE as a host for your cloud infrastructure is also making great progress. We have 3 cloud projects in OBS and hopefully these cover your favorite cloud infrastructure code, Virtualization:Cloud:Eucalyptus, Virtualization:Cloud:OpenNebula, and Virtualization:Cloud:OpenStack. The projects provide repositories for Eucalyptus, OpenNebula, and OpenStack, respectively.</p>
<p>We attempt to make it relatively easy to get a cloud up and running. In this process OpenNebula and OpenStack have progressed the most. Eucalyptus is working, but due to an issue with Eucalyptus and openSSL 1.0 and later (the version in openSUSE) automation has to wait until these issues are resolved.</p>
<p>For OpenNebula we now have a <a href="http://kiwi.berlios.de">KIWI</a> <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI_Cookbook_ONebula_Cloud">example</a> that shows how one can get a cloud setup from scratch in less than 2 hours, including the image build. The example contains a firstboot workflow for the head node, and self configuration of cloud nodes.</p>
<p>For OpenStack <a href="http://susegallery.com/browse">SUSE Gallery</a> images are in the works and will be published in the near future.</p>
<p>All repositories provide packages you can install on running openSUSE systems. If you are interested in using openSUSE as the underlying OS for your cloud or if you want to contribute to the cloud projects, subscribe to the cloud mailing list opensuse-cloud@opensuse.org</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It all started when my daughter discovered the <a href="http://www.wacom.com/bamboo/bamboo_pen.php">Bamboo Pen</a>. Naturally the tablet quickly turned into a must have accessory to her computer. After a bit of Googling I came to the conclusion that making the beast work with Linux should be possible. The prize for the effort would be a very happy young lady.</p>
<p>In order to avoid any potential hassle with shipping etc. we went to the local Best Buy to buy the tablet. As the store had the hardware at the same price as online retailers that decision was easy.</p>
<p>Once I actually had my fingers on the tablet it was time to make it work. Doing a bit more detailed research now, I found various openSUSE forum posts and various other links. Some of these were not quite consistent, others appeared to address only half the solution. Therefore, I decided to cast away most of what I had found and just concentrate on the information found on the <a href="http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/">Linux Wacom Project</a>. The <a href="http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/index.php/howto/main">HOWTO</a> is informative and provides all information needed to get everything working. The HOWTO does not provide the information in the linear fashion I like, when I try to get something new to work. With a bit of hoping back and forth and some pocking around I got the tablet to work.</p>
<p>Now to the linear summary on how to get the tablet working.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install openSUSE 11.3</li>
<li>Install the necessary packages to build the code provided by the Wacom project (root access required)</li>
<ul>
<li>kernel-source</li>
<li>kernel-syms</li>
<li>xorg-x11-server-sdk</li>
<li>plus <strong>make</strong> and <strong>standard build infrastructure</strong></li>
</ul>
<li>Get the sources from the <a href="http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/index.php/dl">Wacom download</a> page (0.8.8 at the time of this writing). This is the kernel driver code. The included X utilities and driver code in this version will not work on openSUSE 11.3 and will not build either, that&#8217;s OK.</li>
<li>Get the X utils and driver code from the <a href="http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/index.php/main">Wacom main page</a>. The link at the time of this writing is near the top of the page and links to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/xf86-input-wacom/xf86-input-wacom-0.10.8.tar.bz2/download">version 0.10.8</a></li>
<li>Build the kernel driver</li>
<ul>
<li>Unpack the kernel driver code <code>tar -xjvf linuxwacom-0.8.8-8.tar.bz2</code></li>
<li><code>cd linuxwacom-0.8.8-8</code></li>
<li>Configure the build <code>./configure --enable-wacom</code></li>
<li>Build the driver <code>make</code></li>
</ul>
<li>Copy the newly built driver over the driver supplied by the openSUSE kernel (root access required) <code>cp src/2.6.30/wacom.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/input/tablet/</code></li>
<ul>
If you want to make a backup copy of the project provided driver make sure you store the copy outside of the modules tree, i.e. outside of <code>/lib/modules/`uname -r`</code></ul>
<li>Remove any updates for the driver <code>rm /lib/modules/`uname -r`/weak-updates/updates/wacom.ko</code></li>
<li>Build the X11 utils and driver</li>
<ul>
<li>Unpack the sources <code>tar -xjvf xf86-input-wacom-0.10.8.tar.bz2</code></li>
<li><code>cd xf86-input-wacom-0.10.8</code></li>
<li>Configure the build <code>./configure</code></li>
<li>Build <code>make</code></li>
<li>Install (root access required)<code>make install</code></li>
</ul>
<li>Create a udev rule (root access required)</li>
<ul>
<li>With your favorite editor open <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/60-wacom.rules</code></li>
<li>Add the following code <code><br />
# udev rules for wacom tablets.<br />
KERNEL!="event[0-9]*", GOTO="wacom_end"<br />
# Multiple interface support for stylus and touch devices.<br />
DRIVERS=="wacom", ATTRS{bInterfaceNumber}=="00", ENV{WACOM_TYPE}="stylus"<br />
DRIVERS=="wacom", ATTRS{bInterfaceNumber}=="01", ENV{WACOM_TYPE}="touch"<br />
# Convenience links for the common case of a single tablet.  We could do just this:<br />
#ATTRS{idVendor}=="056a", SYMLINK+="input/wacom-$env{WACOM_TYPE}"<br />
# but for legacy reasons, we keep the input/wacom link as the generic stylus device.<br />
ATTRS{idVendor}=="056a", ENV{WACOM_TYPE}!="touch", SYMLINK+="input/wacom"<br />
ATTRS{idVendor}=="056a", ENV{WACOM_TYPE}=="touch", SYMLINK+="input/wacom-touch"<br />
# Check and repossess the device if a module other than the wacom one<br />
# is already bound to it.<br />
ATTRS{idVendor}=="056a", ACTION=="add", RUN+="check_driver wacom $devpath $env{ID_BUS}"<br />
LABEL="wacom_end"<br />
</code></li>
</ul>
<li>Regenerate the module dependencies <code>depmod -e</code></li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are multiple options to set up a slide show screen saver that shows the pictures of your choosing when the screen saver kicks in. The following shows the various options and works with the gnome-screensaver.</p>
<p><strong>Easy does it</strong></p>
<p>The most direct way to get a slide show screen saver going is to place your pictures in the $HOME/Pictures directory, then start the GNOME screen saver settings dialog by using gnome-screensaver-preferences from the command line or by selecting the Screensaver icon in the Control Center (gnome-control-center). In the screen saver settings dialog select &#8220;Pictures folder&#8221; and click &#8220;Close&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>One step of customization (not the preferred option)</strong></p>
<p>If you do not want to use the Pictures directory as the location for the pictures to be shown you can customize the location by making a few simple edits. As the root user edit the file /usr/share/applications/screensavers/personal-slideshow.desktop. At the end of the line that starts with &#8220;Exec&#8221; add &#8220;&#8211;location=PATH_TO_PICTURE_DIRECTORY&#8221;, without the quotes and with PATH_TO_PICTURE_DIRECTORY being a real path. For example if my pictures were in /opt/slideshow the modified line would look as follows:</p>
<p>Exec=/usr/lib/gnome-screensaver/gnome-screensaver/slideshow &#8211;location=/opt/slideshow</p>
<p>Save the file and select the &#8220;Pictures folder&#8221; in the screen saver preferences dialog to select the slide show as your screen saver.</p>
<p>While this is a straight forward modification this is not really a good solution. The reason being that this modifies a file that is part of a package and when the package gets updated you will loose your changes.</p>
<p><strong>A second step of customization<br />
</strong><br />
The better solution to accomplish the task of customizing the picture location is to create a new .desktop file in /usr/share/applications/screensavers. You should use the personal-slideshow.desktop file as your starting point. </p>
<p>As root copy the personal-slideshow.desktop file to a file with a name of your choice, then edit the file. Change the value of &#8220;Name&#8221;, &#8220;Comment&#8221;, and add the &#8220;&#8211;location&#8221; option at the end of the &#8220;Exec&#8221; value as previously. Save the file and start the GNOME screen saver preferences dialog. In the list to the left search for the value you assigned to the &#8220;Name&#8221; variable when you edited the new .desktop file. Select it and your all set.</p>
<p><strong>Getting fancy</strong></p>
<p>If the animation of the pictures in the previous slide show setup is not sufficiently fancy for you, the GLSlideshow screen saver maybe the ticket for you. Unfortunately you cannot just simply configure the location of the images you would like to use in the GNOME screen saver preferences dialog or via command line arguments to the glslideshow screen saver. In order to configure the location of the images to be used it is necessary to run the xscreensaver settings dialog (don&#8217;t worry, in the end gnome-screensaver will be running again). </p>
<p>Just starting xscreensaver will fail as only one screen saver daemon per display is allowed. Therefore, it is necessary to first kill the gnome-screensaver; use the following commands:</p>
<p>-&gt; ps -A | grep gnome-screens</p>
<p>At the beginning of the line this produces you will find a number, this is the process ID (PID). Use this number in the next command</p>
<p>-&gt; kill -9 PID</p>
<p>Now fire up xscreensaver and select &#8220;Settings&#8221;. In the settings dialog select &#8220;GLSlideshow&#8221; and then switch to the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; tab. In the &#8220;Image Manipulation&#8221; frame select &#8220;Choose Random Image&#8221; and then enter the path of the directory containing your image files in the text box below the check button text. If you click the &#8220;Settings&#8221; button on the &#8220;Display Modes&#8221; tab you can set various parameters for the slide show.</p>
<p>With the slide show configured you can switch back to the GNOME screen saver if you so desire. In the settings dialog select File-&gt;Kill Daemon, then File-&gt;Quit. Now in a terminal window restart the GNOME screen saver by using the &#8220;gnome-screensaver&#8221; command. The process is a daemon and it will background itself. That&#8217;s it, now if you select the GLSlideshow in the GNOME screen saver preferences dialog you will see your images being selected.</p>
<p>With this you can have a slide show as your screen saver in no time.</p>
<p>Happy Hacking.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Locking down the desktop may be an important functionality for you or it may be a major annoyance. This depends on your point of view and on which side of the administration fence you are. There are certainly many use cases where the restriction of desktop functionality is very important. One such use case may be the configuration of machines in a teaching environment.</p>
<p>For GNOME, <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Sabayon">Sabayon</a> is a GUI tool that allows you to set up the desktop to your liking and store the configuration as a profile. Profiles can be deployed to any system allowing the machine to display the desired desktop based on who logs into the machine. Further you may also use <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Pessulus">Pessulus</a> to lock down the GNOME desktop. Additional information may also be found in the <a href="http://library.gnome.org/admin/deployment-guide/">GNOME Admin Guide</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the options mentioned above there is a command line tool (gconftool-2) you may use to create customizations from the command line. The <b>gconftool-2</b> tool creates entries in the configuration tree for gconfd, the GNOME configuration daemon. The GNOME configuration is stored in XML files named <b>%gconf.xml</b> in a directory structure where directory names indicate the part of the desktop or GNOME application to which the features set in the XML file apply. For example options set in apps/nautilus/desktop/%gconf.xml determine the behavior of <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Nautilus">Nautilus</a> when the desktop is drawn. </p>
<p>For users the configuration tree is stored in $HOME/.gconf allowing users to configure the desktop appearance and application behavior to their liking. For system wide configuration, configuration trees exist in /etc/gconf. Within the <b>/etc/gconf</b> directory structure the <b>gconf.xml.mandatory</b> directory tree represents the configuration tree that is used to lock down the system. Options specified in the /etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory configuration tree cannot be altered by the user.</p>
<p>For example if we want to disable icons for mounted volumes to be displayed on the desktop and we would not want users to be able to enable this feature the following command will do the trick:</p>
<pre>
gconftool-2 --direct --config-source \
 xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory \
 --type boolean --set /apps/nautilus/desktop/volumes_visible "false"
</pre>
<p>The path of the parameter to be set can be determined by using the <b>gconf-editor</b> tool. The gconf-editor is an editor/browser for the GNOME configuration tree and is very helpful when trying to find features to be manipulated within the GNOME configuration directory. Detailed information about the gconf-editor can be found <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gconf">here</a>. Knowing the path for the option to be set and the location of the configuration tree that contains the locked down configuration (/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory) it is easy enough to create a script that can be executed when a machine is set up to configure the desktop appearance as desired.</p>
<p>If you are using KIWI to create system images the gconftool-2 commands can easily be added to the config.sh script to configure the desktop behavior in the image. Creating a self installing CD/DVD or USB stick with KIWI allows you to deploy your pre-configured desktop image when ever a new system needs to be commissioned.</p>
<p>As a final option to locking down GNOME there is the well trusted route of editing the configuration files. Important when creating a GNOME configuration tree manually is that a %gconf.xml file needs to exist at every level. Considering our previous example one will need to create a %gconf.xml file as shown in the directory tree layout below:</p>
<pre>
apps
   |__ %gconf.xml
   |
   |__ nautilus
              |__ %gconf.xml
              |
              |__ desktop
                       |__ %gconf.xml
</pre>
<p>The XML files at the apps and nautilus directory levels are empty but must exist. The %gconf.xml file at the desktop level contains the following entry:</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;gconf&gt;
    &lt;entry name="volumes_visible" mtime="1260052996" type="bool" value="false"/&gt;
&lt;/gconf&gt;
</pre>
<p>The XML is simple enough and self explanatory. Further as you explore the configuration in the gconf-editor tool the types to be entered in the XML are fairly obvious. One caveate applies for entries of type string. Rather than having the value of a string configuration option be an attribute of the entry element like other types the string is special. For a string you will need to use the &lt;stringvalue&gt; child element of the &lt;entry&gt; element. For example if you wanted to disable the panel completely you would have the following entry</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;gconf&gt;
    &lt;entry name="panel" mtime="1263563592" type="string"&gt;
        &lt;stringvalue&gt;&lt;/stringvalue&gt;
    &lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;/gconf&gt;
</pre>
<p>in /etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory/desktop/gnome/session/required_components/%gconf.xml</p>
<p>The gconftool-2 command creates the tree in the location specified with the &#8211;config-source command line option. Thus you can switch between manual edits and using a tool very easily. Once you have your tree you can package it up as an RPM and also add it to your auto YaST deployment if you are using this methodology.</p>
<p>With the available tools and/or by editing the configuration files directly locking down the GNOME desktop is relatively straight forward. The tricky part often is to find the correct file or the correct button to push for the desired behavior. This is where gconf-editor is the very valuable browser you are looking for.</p>
<p>Happy Hacking.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dell Mini 10v is nothing special from a hardware perspective for a Netbook, and follows along the specs of most other Netbook models on the market today. The integrated buttons in the track-pad take some time getting used to, and IMHO separate buttons are more user friendly. For my recently acquired new toy I increased the RAM to 2 GB and added the larger battery. On the software side the Dell Mini 10v is something special as it is one of few Netbooks available with Linux pre-installed. Other Netbook brands either have no Linux option or charge extra when straying of the beaten hardware and OS combination path, at what I consider to be outrages rates. While as a devoted SUSE user I&#8217;d rather see openSUSE than Ubuntu pre-installed getting Linux on the machine and not having any of my hard earned money diverted to the monopolist from Redmond was a key purchasing decision.</p>
<p>Once unpacked and the battery charged I played with the Ubuntu distribution pre-installed by Dell for a while. Network configuration was easy enough and I could probably get used to the Desktop interface if I used it for a while. Next up was Moblin, more out of curiosity than for &#8220;serious&#8221; evaluation purposes. Having read some concerns about openSUSE 11.2 on Netbooks in some mailing list thread or review I decided to give it a try, knowing that I might be in for an unpleasant surprise. At the same time I was setting up the machine a thread about the Broadcom wireless card used in the Dell Mini appeared on the openSUSE mailing list,very timely indeed. As it turns out my concerns were unfounded.</p>
<p>I downloaded the GNOME Live CD from http://www.opensuse.org/en/, then used the information provided on the openSUSE wiki (http://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick) to create a USB live image. After fiddling with the BIOS setting to boot from USB media first I was able to run the openSUSE 11.2 live image and the installer from the stick. Once openSUSE 11.2 was installed I configured the Ethernet card to get network access. Empowered with access to the Internet I added the packman repository</p>
<p># zypper ar http://ftp.skynet.be/pub/packman/suse/11.2/ Packman</p>
<p>This can also be done through YaST for those more comfortable with GUI tools.</p>
<p>Next step was to refresh the repository data</p>
<p># zypper refresh</p>
<p>and then to install the Broadcom firmware package and kernel driver</p>
<p># zypper in broadcom-wl broadcom-wl-kmp-default</p>
<p>last but not least I loaded the module into the kernel</p>
<p># modprobe wl</p>
<p>and now the Broadcom wireless card showed up when using the ifconfig command as eth1. I used the NetworkManager applet to configure the network connecting to my wireless AP and everything works just fine.</p>
<p>In summary, all is well with openSUSE 11.2 on the Dell Mini 10v including the 3D desktop with compiz.</p>
