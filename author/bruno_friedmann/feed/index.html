				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Long time not talking about fglrx rpm, mostly because they&#8217;ve got no update since last December 2015.</p>
<h3 style="color:red">Short Summary</h3>
<p>In a word as hundred, fglrx is now a dead horse!</p>
<p><img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/090214failsoftwaredevelopment-1234881541128932-3/95/090214-fail-software-development-6-728.jpg?cb=1234860218" alt="Dead horse" /></p>
<p>We had the hope of getting it working for Leap 42.2 in October, but except freezing kernel and xorg, you will not get what you would expect: a stable xorg session</p>
<p><strong>Say goodbye fglrx!, repeat after me, goodbye fglrx.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>If you are locked down and forced for any reasons to use fglrx with your gpu, and are still using 42.1, then don&#8217;t upgrade to 42.2, without a plan B</p></blockquote>
<p>It has no more support from AMD upstream, and that&#8217;s it!, if someone want to break its computer, it&#8217;s still possible to pick the last files and try it by yourself, but the repository will never contain it for 42.2 (see below how-to)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s said, I&#8217;m not still sure, to keep for a long time the repository, I&#8217;ve been managing since 6 years now.</p>
<h3>A bit of history</h3>
<p>In 2010, when we were working hard to get 11.1 out, the news that no supported ATI (at that time) will be available for end-users, as we have for nvidia gpu</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t check back the irc log, but we were a few, that would like to have this still available, by pure commodity. Especially that I&#8217;ve just exchanged a non working gpu by my new hd5750.</p>
<p>I remember the first chaotic steps, how to build that, and create repeating builds, what about the license? Did we have the right to offer a pre-build rpm etc. I spent some time fixing all of this stuff.<br />
And start the build on real hardware. Hey afterward kvm was really in infancy stage.
</p>
<p>Release after release amd/ati and openSUSE, the driver was build, on hardware for each supported distribution. When beginning of 2013 Sebastian Siebert, who got some direct contacts with AMD, release<br />
his own script, we collaborate to have the possibility to build on virtual machines, which allow me to simplify the build process, as having on kvm for each openSUSE release supported.
</p>
<p>Afterward, AMD start to split fglrx with the fglrx for HD5xx and above, and fglrx-legacy. So 2 drivers to maintain, but as always with proprietary software, the legacy version became rapidly obsolete,<br />
and non usable. Not that bad, in the meantime the AMD effort on the free and open source radeon driver, quickly overcome the performance of legacy.</p>
<p>Still from 2013, to 2016 I&#8217;ve been able to propose ready to use rpm for several version of openSUSE&#8217;s distributions. I think the repository serve quite well end users, and I never got big flames.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t avoid to mention the openSUSE powered server and sponsored by <a href="http://www.ioda-net.ch">Ioda-Net Sàrl</a> that has serve this objective so well during that time frame.</p>
<h3>Future of the repository</h3>
<p>Now that fglrx is becoming obsolete, I think seriously about why the repository online should stay online.</p>
<p>At openSUSE project level, we still have 13.1, 13.2, 42.1 and 42.2 that are mostly active. 13.1 is already almost out of the game of evergreen,<br />
13.2 will follow soon, and I don&#8217;t know yet the exact plan for 42.1, but it will certainly go out of maintenance in less than a year.
</p>
<p>If you feel or have the need of the repository, please express that in the comments below.</p>
<h3>Wait there&#8217;s amd-gpu-pro, no?</h3>
<p>Yeap there&#8217;s a closed driver, called amd-gpu-pro, available, for newer cards. But there&#8217;s two things that bring me out of the game, first I don&#8217;t have those newer gpu,<br />
and don&#8217;t have the need to replace my hd5750 for the moment. The second and certainly the most important, those drivers are only available for Ubuntu or at least in .deb format.</p>
<p>I will certainly not help proprietary crap, if I don&#8217;t have a solid base to work with, and a bit of help from their side. I wish good luck to those who want to try those drivers,<br />
I&#8217;ve got a look inside, and got a blame face.</p>
<h3>For crazy, and those who don&#8217;t love their computer</h3>
<p>So you want to loose your time? you can! I&#8217;ve kept <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx/raw-src">in raw-src directory</a> all the script used to build the driver.<br />
They differ a bit compared to <a href="http://www.sebastian-siebert.de/">Sebastian Siebert last version</a> in the sense of making Leap 422 as a possible target.<br />
If you dig a bit around, you should be able to build them, but you&#8217;re alone on that way, you&#8217;ve been warned!
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not against a republished version, if someone find a way to make them working, just drop me a message.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for this journey, Have Fun! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Warnings</h3>
<p>There’s no warranties the drivers will work, for you!</p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the open-source radeon drivers,<span style="color: #ff0000"> <b>don’t risk to break your computer !<br />
</b></span></p>
<p>Still there will NEVER be a fglrx driver for recent kernel and xorg. So if one of those component change in Leap fglrx will be broken.</p>
<h3>Actual situation</h3>
<p>Since last december, AMD doesn&#8217;t published any update about fglrx so the version is still the 15.12.302 published. A few days ago our beloved Leap release manager Ludwig ask me by email, if there will be an available drivers for Leap 42.2.</p>
<p>Today, after hacking a bit the last Sebastian Siebert&#8217;s script I&#8217;ve been able to build the drivers for Leap 42.2 RC1, and the driver install fine, and xorg start on my HD5750 (but that&#8217;s all what I can tell).</p>
<p>I will rebuild the driver once Leap 42.2 will hit its final stage.</p>
<h3>Repository</h3>
<pre>zypper ar -cfg -n FGLRX http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx/openSUSE_Leap_42.2/ FLGRX

zypper -v refresh -f FGLRX

zypper -v install fglrx64_amdcccle_SUSE422 fglrx64_core_SUSE422 fglrx64_graphics_SUSE422  fglrx64_opencl_SUSE422 fglrx64_xpic_SUSE422</pre>
<h3>Future</h3>
<p>AMD has stopped any development for FGLRX, so it is already considered obsolete. But on the other side they make a lot of effort to bring radeon and amdgpu (the free and open source driver) to a decent performance level.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have that much usage anymore of my AMD gpu powered computer, and my HD5750 is now 8 years old already, so I can&#8217;t promise to be able to follow up with changes.</p>
<h3>Cleanup</h3>
<p>I removed all the obsoletes packages letting only the last one for each openSUSE version still available. Also the server has no more copy of openSUSE github artwork. If this missing to someone, don&#8217;t hesitate to ask.</p>
<p>Have fun</p>

<h2>Report of a week of sprint</h2>
<p>TOSprint in Paris has just ended (<a href="https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Paris_Code_Sprint_2016">wiki page</a>).</p>
<p><b>What a week!</b></p>
<p>First of all I want to warmfully thank the sponsors, especially Olivier Courtin from Oslandia for the organization, and Mozilla France for hosting us.</p>
<h3>What is TOSprint?</h3>
<p>Once a year a bunch of hackers from projects under OsGeo umbrella, meet in a face to face sprint.<br />
This year it happenned in Paris with great number of participants (52).</p>
<p>There was globally five big groups, and if each community was running its own schedule,<br />
there was a lot of cross echanges too.</p>
<p><a href="https://flic.kr/p/ErD5E8"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/TOSprint_Paris_Mozilla.png" alt="TOSprint Mozilla" width="600" height="187" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11740" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/TOSprint_Paris_Mozilla.png 600w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/TOSprint_Paris_Mozilla-300x94.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<caption>Mateusz Łoskot</caption>
<p></a></p>
<h3>Personal objectives</h3>
<p>My main objective, except being enough luckly to be a sponsor, was to go there and be in direct contact with upstream.</p>
<p>This can help a lot to improve packages, and create new ones.</p>
<p>Moreover, as one of my openSUSE&#8217;s Application:Geo peer maintainer, Angelos Kalkas was also participating, we decided to make somes changes, and improve the situation of the repository.</p>
<p><span id="more-11732"></span></p>
<h3>openSUSE packaging</h3>
<p>We were using a Staging repository to test the global changes to minimize the breakage on the main repo, kinda à la Factory <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about what you will get once the rebuild will finished:<br />
<b>* gdal</b> goes to 2.0.2 which is big jump since version 1.11</p>
<p><b>* postgis</b> got upgrade to 2.2.1 with sfcgal as dependency so 3D operations are avalaible.</p>
<p>I added two interesting extensions for postgresql/postgis database<br />
 <b>&#8211; pgRouting :</b> a long time missing extension in our repository. see <a href="http://pgrouting.org/">pgrouting.org</a><br />
 <b>&#8211; pointcloud :</b> allow you to store and work with pointcloud in postgresql and also contain a postgis extension. see <a href="https://github.com/pgpointcloud/pointcloud">https://github.com/pgpointcloud/pointcloud</a><br />
Both packages are respecting the postgresql/postgis naming scheme: so to install pointcloud on a postgresql94 server you will install postgresql94-pointcloud package.<br />
They are available at least for 13.2, Leap 42.1, Tumbleweed.</p>
<p>A big thanks to Paul Ramsey for his help resolving the issues raised. Especially the advise to stick to -j1 during compilation of postgis <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><b>* PDAL <a href="http://www.pdal.io/">pdal.io</a></b> (with libght) is a point cloud abstraction layer which is under active development and should<br />
in the future replace libLAS once the compatible C interface will be written.<br />
  A big thanks to Howard Butler, for helping to get all packaging issues resolved.</p>
<p><b>* Mapserver :</b> <a href="http://mapserver.org">mapserver.org</a><br />
During the week, mapserver team made impressive changes:<br />
 &#8211; First by closing numerous github issues which didn&#8217;t get updates for a long time.<br />
They run a bot script which automatically close the github issue, and users get a nice message about it.<br />
Perhaps it could inspire us, on how we write closing ticket in bugtriage.<br />
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/139706282@N06/24936988840/in/album-72157664338100169/" title="OSGeo TOSprint Paris"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1508/24936988840_183b1b805f_n.jpg" width="320" height="213" alt="OSGeo TOSprint Paris"></a></p>
<pre style="background:gray;color:white;font-style:italic">
  This is an automated comment

  This issue has been closed due to lack of activity. This doesn't mean the issue is invalid,
  it simply got no attention within the last year. Please reopen with missing/relevant information
  if still valid.

  Typically, issues fall in this state for one of the following reasons:

      Hard, impossible or not enough information to reproduce
      Missing test case
      Lack of a champion with interest and/or funding to address the issue
</pre>
<p> &#8211; Part of the team took the challenge to update all the tutorial material.<br />
 &#8211; A number of question about the future of mapscript : lacking maintenance resources (humans and or funding)<br />
 &#8211; Bugfix release on thursday night. 6.4.3 and 7.0.1</p>
<p>For openSUSE, I&#8217;ve been discussing a lot with Thomas Bonfort.<br />
The idea would be to be able to propose at least two or more versions that receive security and bug fixes. Actually the 6.4 and the 7.0 branches.<br />
This will allow people to smoothly upgrade their map files, when there&#8217;s breakage or adaptation needed.</p>
<p>I classify this request as a good idea, and started analyzing what we can do. So its actually a work in progress.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing more enthusiastic (for me) than participating to a FLOSS event. If some days are more frustrating than others, the others serve to build this free world we all need.<br />
So I would like to ping your attention : <b> all FLOSS software and communities need your contribution </b>. If you&#8217;re using one of them, become interested in how it is built, organized, start to learn today how to contribute, and enjoy your journey.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to come, especially on the mapserver side, and more and more packages.<br />
Stay tuned!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
You&#8217;ve certainly noticed that I didn&#8217;t run for a second turn, after my first 2 years. This doesn&#8217;t mean the election time and the actual campaign are boring <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
<br />If you are an openSUSE Member, we really want to have your vote, so go to <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election">Board Election Wiki</a> and make your own opinion.<br />
<br />The ballot should open tomorrow.
</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/board-leaving-tigerfoot.png" alt="board-leaving-tigerfoot" width="370" height="262" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11655" style="margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/board-leaving-tigerfoot.png 370w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/board-leaving-tigerfoot-300x212.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px" /></p>
<h3>Why not a second turn?</h3>
<p>Being a board member (present at almost every conference call, reading the mailing lists and other task) consume free time. It has increased during the last semester too. And we&#8217;ve got some new business opportunities here at Ioda-Net Sàrl in 2015, and those need also my attention for the next year(s). I prefer to be a retired Board member, than not being able to handle my responsabilities.<br />
But I&#8217;m not against the idea of a <i>&quot;I&#8217;ll be back&quot;</i> in a near future. Moreover with a bit more bandwidth in my free time, I will be able to continue my packaging stuff, and other contributions.
</p>
<h3 style="clear:both">What a journey!</h3>
<p>With the new campaign running, I found funny to bring back to light my <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_platform_2013_tigerfoot">2013 platform</a> written 2 years ago. And spent 5 minutes on checking the differences with today. I&#8217;m inviting you to discover the small interview between me and myself <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
</p>
<h4>1. Which sentences would you say again today?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m a &quot;Fucking Green Dreamer&quot; of a world of collaboration, which will one day offer Freedom for everyone.<br />
<br />Clearly still a day by day mantra and leitmotiv. But even if I&#8217;m dreaming, I never forget that<br />
<b>Freedom has a price : Freedom will only be what you do for it.</b>
</p>
<p><span id="more-11647"></span></p>
<h4>2. Which thing you would not say again, or differently ?</h4>
<p>Well, as there&#8217;s no joker card, let&#8217;s start by this one:<br />
&quot;A Visible Active Board &gt; A Visible Active Project.&quot; With the experience and time, and interaction, (the one who said fight, get out please :-)), I would said this is not as easy as it sound first.<br />
I&#8217;m pretty sure, I was more quieter since I was on the board, than before. Because it&#8217;s too hard to make a clear distinction, when you just want to express something as &quot;a simple contributor&quot;: you are on the board, and then whatever you can try to trick the fact: you&#8217;re still a board member.<br />
<br />So making the Board visible like a kind of communicant Alien, will certainly not improve that much our project.<br />
It&#8217;s written everywhere, almost everybody agree, the board is not the lighthouse in the dark showing you the future.<br />
Anyone, I repeat, anyone in this community is a potential vector of a future for openSUSE.
</p>
<p>So in my past platform &quot;Guardians of the past, Managers of the present, Creators of the future.&quot; I would replace Creators of the future by kinda &quot;enabler&quot;</p>
<h4>3. In the last 2 years, where did openSUSE mostly evolve?</h4>
<p>I think we moved from a traditional way of building distribution to some creative alternative, the rolling but tested Tumbleweed, and the hybrid Leap are really good things that happened.<br />
I believe that if we have also some hard time on mailing list, which are exhausting, they also have a positive aspect (yeap:-)). If we fight, then it&#8217;s certainly because of our faith in something. Is this one defined? Not sure! But I&#8217;m pretty convinced that all members around have a good image of it.
</p>
<h4>4. What would be an advice to your successor (even if he doesn&#8217;t care about it)?</h4>
<p>We are a tooling community, we love tools. Beware of one thing, if you get hurt by a tool, you can become the worst asshole you&#8217;ve never met. With tools, you can also hurt other people.
</p>
<p>My advise, watch your step and keystroke!</p>

<h4>5. Something more you would like to share?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve invested time and energy during 2014 and beginning of 2015, to run booth, talks, represent openSUSE&#8217;s project all around. It was awesome to go to those events and meet people, involved or interested about openSUSE.<br />
<br /> Perhaps some of you don&#8217;t know, but we have friends all around us, in many communities, and when the magic about working together appears, it just blast my heart.
</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and for your support during this period</p>

<p>It seems since the release, that a number of report of broken xorg with gdm, ssdm and so&#8230; segfaulting</p>
<p>You can still use the previous version hanging on the server. But I doubt it would work better</p>
<p>As soon, with Sebastian Siebert we have a patch for, I will republish a new build</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the last few months, we all know that the new openSUSE Leap 42.1 is on its road.<br />
<br />
But fglrx drivers were missing. Even with the 15.9 release in September.
</p>
<h3>Warnings</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s really no warranties the drivers will work, for you!</p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the open-source radeon drivers, <b style="color:red">don&#8217;t risk to break your computer</b></p>
<p>All the trouble present in 15.9 will be there, like the failing gnome3 gdm start, see previous article from Sebastian, his scripts also available on the raw-src directory on the mirror, allow you to apply a quirk patch.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m considering the release of thoses rpms as experimental, they work for some, and sometimes are convenient. But they can also create kernel segfault on some configurations.<br />
If you are in trouble start your openSUSE in rescue mode with nomodeset on boot line, and then zypper rm fglrx related packages, reboot and you should safely return to free radeon.
</p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Today, while packing my stuff for the SUSECON15 in Amsterdam, I was pleased on irc to have feedback of users<br />
who were able to run fglrx Tumbleweed packages on their Leap 42.1
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve then start a Leap vm and hack a bit Sebastian Siebert&#8217;s script for 15.9 to add support for Leap.<br />
The drivers build, and install correctly. I&#8217;ve also updated the one-click installer for people using this<br />
technology.
</p>
<p>
Leap being available only for x86_64 bit plateform, the driver follow the same available arch.
</p>
<p>Links to the new repository <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx/openSUSE_Leap_42.1">openSUSE_Leap_42</a></p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was one of the creator and maintainers of bacula packages on obs (Story started 4 years ago).<br />
Since then (+3 years) I&#8217;m using another tool called Bareos, and have no more interest<br />
nor time to maintain those packages.</p>
<p>Since sometimes, bacula project has released two main major version. (7.0 and 7.2).<br />
Nobody has taken care of the packages available on obs Archiving:Backup, nor have<br />
proposed an update. [1]</p>
<p>Those packages have never been submitted to Factory, and proposed to any released openSUSE version.<br />
From one of the last upstream announcement Bacula project will deliver directly prebuild packages for major distributions.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re interested to take ownership of those, raise your hands now (ask maintainer status with obs interface).<br />
I will let a grace period of one month before sending a delete request.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Geekos, here a small summary of our Thursday February 19th openSUSE miniSummit event here at SCale 13x.</p>
<p>Located in Century AB room, a 80 seats room. The average attendance rate was varying between 50% and 85%.<br />
Qualifying the attendance 50% or more were not related to SUSE / openSUSE, which was a good experience of question and feedback.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_3087.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_3087-300x200.jpg" alt="openSUSE miniSummit T-shirt" width="300" height="200" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11288" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_3087-300x200.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_3087-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The day started by a talk about openSUSE / SUSE Xen and openstack by Peter Linnel and Russel Pavlicek.<br />
One hour later Manu Gupta has presented all the bolts and nuts about GSOC at openSUSE.</p>
<p>We then go for lunch, and corridor exchanges.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve opened the afternoon with my talk &#8220;them + me = we&#8221; about breaking mythic frontier<br />
Then just after a small break, Mark Fasheh member of filesystem SUSE Labs group has talk about the project Duperemove: dedupe on btrfs (have a look on github the source are there, and package available on obs)</p>
<p>The day continue with a Town Hall talk co-animated by myself and Peter running an open discussion with attendees. With interesting remarks and feedback from openSUSE users, and also complete foreigners. For example, the way systemd was introduced in openSUSE distribution was appreciated (having choice during 2 versions). It was an unstressfull, open and positive exchange.  </p>
<p>To follow, Bryan Lunduke and Peter animated a talk about &#8220;the 10 things you would love about SUSE and openSUSE if you only you knew&#8230;&#8221;<br />
I did really enjoy the way they numbered the slides &#8230;<br />
Freschy, punchy, funky, the kinda talk I would like to see again at OSC15.</p>
<p>To finalize the day, Markus Feilner​ for Linux Magazine (de) talked about openQA.</p>
<p>I found interesting the perfect mix we&#8217;ve done between openSUSE and SUSE during this day, confirming the excellent partnership we have.<br />
Let the sponsors of this day be warmly thanked to make it happened.</p>
