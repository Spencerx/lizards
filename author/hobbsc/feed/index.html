				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This has been covered on a couple of forums out there, but I&#8217;ve yet to find a decent comprehensive post.  This is for 32bit systems, it&#8217;s easily modified for 64bit setups.</p>
<p>First off, search your favorite RPM repo for binutils-2.19-9.3.  I like to use http://rpm.pbone.net, but at the time of writing, they happen to be down.</p>
<p>Get a copy of the Novell Client ISO from http://download.novell.com and mount it:</p>
<p><code>sudo mount -o loop novell-client-2.0-sp2-sle11-i586.iso /mnt<br />
</code></p>
<p>Extract the files from the RPM: </p>
<p><code>rpm2cpio binutils-2.19-9.3.i586.rpm | cpio -idv<br />
</code></p>
<p>This should create a &#8220;usr&#8221; directory in your present working directory.  Go ahead and copy it&#8217;s contents to your filesystem:</p>
<p><code>sudo cp -R usr/* /usr/<br />
</code></p>
<p>Change directories to wherever you mounted your ISO (in this case &#8220;/mnt&#8221;) and run the installer:</p>
<p><code>cd /mnt &amp;&amp; sudo ./ncl_install</code></p>
<p>As the packages attempt to install, you&#8217;ll be given options and warnings concerning libbfd and several other packages.  Choose option &#8220;2&#8221; for everything (&#8220;Break dependencies&#8221;).  Don&#8217;t worry about actually breaking anything, just roll with option 2.</p>
<p>Lastly, issue ldconfig as root and reboot:</p>
<p><code>sudo /sbin/ldconfig<br />
sudo /sbin/reboot</code></p>
<p>That should get you up and running.  You can run &#8220;ncl_tray&#8221; directly from the command line, or create a shortcut to the client.  If you&#8217;re having connection issues, make sure that openSLP is configured.</p>
<p>The only issues I&#8217;ve had so far is the inability to browse trees, which turned out to be a DNS problem on my end.  Occasionally I get warnings on login about novfs kernel modules not being properly loaded, but this appears to be benign.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve posted or been active in the community, so I thought I&#8217;d toss an update out there.  I&#8217;ll cross post this on my personal blog and on Cool Solutions (modified for SLEx 10).  This is a pretty rudimentary post as installation from source is pretty straightforward, but perhaps it&#8217;ll be useful to someone.</p>
<p>The only requirements for this build that I&#8217;m aware of at this time are make, gcc, and the openssl/openssl-devel packages.</p>
<p>The default Ruby distribution in 11.2 is 1.8.7, contrasting the current stable release of 1.9.1.  If you already have Ruby installed via zypper, you&#8217;ll need to uninstall it (&#8216;sudo zypper rm ruby&#8217;), otherwise the first step is to grab the latest release from <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">﻿http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/</a>.</p>
<p>Next, unpack your release (replacing 1.9.1-p376 with the build you downloaded):</p>
<p><code>tar xfvz ruby-﻿1.9.1-p376.tar.gz</code></p>
<p>Change to the extracted directory and run the config script:</p>
<p><code>cd ruby-1.9.1-p376 &amp;&amp; ./configure</code></p>
<p>Build the release:  Note that you can allow jobs to run simultaneously with the -j switch, see make (1) for further details.</p>
<p><code>make</code></p>
<p>Install the release as root:</p>
<p><code>sudo make install</code></p>
<p>To verify that 1.9 is indeed installed, issue:</p>
<p><code>ruby --version</code></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was a bit of a bear, but I&#8217;ve inhereted a generic looking USB EVDO stick at the office.  After some research and elbow grease, I&#8217;ve managed to get it working.  In this post, I&#8217;ll detail  EVDO configuration under SLED 10.  I&#8217;ll leave out most of the gory technical details as others have covered that for me.  I&#8217;ll link to the appropriate reference where necessary.</p>
<p><span id="more-416"></span></p>
<p>The UM175AL card from Alltel attempts to identify itself as a USB storage device/cdrom when it&#8217;s first inserted.  This is a huge mess as it needs to be recognized as a serial device.  After some searching, I came across <a title="http://blogger.ziesemer.com/2008/10/alltel-um175al-usb-evdo-ubuntu.html" href="http://blogger.ziesemer.com/2008/10/alltel-um175al-usb-evdo-ubuntu.html">Mark A. Ziesemer&#8217;s post</a> on using this same card under Ubuntu.  He recommends using <a title="http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/" href="http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/">USB_ModeSwitch</a> to change the device&#8217;s mode.</p>
<p>First, I downloaded the USB_ModeSwitch source, extracted it, and deleted the binary.  Next, you&#8217;ll want to download libusb and libusb-devel from the <a title="http://software.opensuse.org/search" href="http://software.opensuse.org/search">OBS</a>.  If you don&#8217;t have OneClick-Install enabled on your SLED install, simply download the libusb RPMs and issue the following commands:</p>
<blockquote><p>rpm -Uv libusb-*.rpm</p>
<p>rpm -ivh libusb-devel*.rpm</p></blockquote>
<p>Once those are installed, go ahead and issue &#8216;make&#8217; in the USB_ModeSwitch directory.  This should execute rather quickly and you should have a new usb_modeswitch binary.  Copy &#8216;usb_modeswitch&#8217; to /usr/sbin.</p>
<p>Next you&#8217;ll need to create a config for USB_ModeSwitch.  As root, edit /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf with the following information (all the gory details can be found at Mark&#8217;s site if you&#8217;re up for a read):</p>
<blockquote><p># /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf</p>
<p># alltel evdo hax<br />
DefaultVendor = 0x106c<br />
DefaultProduct = 0x3b03</p>
<p>MessageEndpoint = 0x05<br />
MessageContent = &#8220;55534243904ed68a24000000800008ff024445564348470000000000000000&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that the above only works for this particular card.  You can likely ignore that if your EVDO card is already supported.</p>
<p>Now we should be able to access the modem and use &#8216;wvdial&#8217; (which conveniently ships with SLED) to get connected.  First we&#8217;ll need to edit our /etc/wvdial.conf.  This example is for Alltel only:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Dialer Defaults]<br />
Stupid Mode = On<br />
Modem = /dev/ttyACM0<br />
Baud = 921600<br />
Init = ATZ<br />
Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &amp;C1 &amp;D2 +FCLASS=0<br />
Phone = #777<br />
Username = XXXXXXXXXX@alltel.net<br />
Password = alltel<br />
Init1 = ATZ<br />
ISDN = 0<br />
Modem Type = Analog Modem<br />
Auto Reconnect = on<br />
Carrier Check = no<br />
[Dialer shh]<br />
Init3 = ATM0<br />
[Dialer Pulse]<br />
Dial Command = ATDP</p></blockquote>
<p>Replace XXXXXXXXXX with your 10 digit phone number.  I gleaned this information from two sources:  <a title="http://www.linux.com/feature/145134" href="http://www.linux.com/feature/145134">Linux.com&#8217;s EVDO tutorial for VoIP</a> and <a title="http://www.linuxscrew.com/2007/09/03/ev-do-internet-access-with-ubuntu-linux/" href="http://www.linuxscrew.com/2007/09/03/ev-do-internet-access-with-ubuntu-linux/">Linux * Screw&#8217;s EVDO with Linux article</a>.</p>
<p>Now that everything is all configured, plug in your EVDO stick and use usb_switchmode to switch it to the proper mode for serial access:</p>
<blockquote><p>/usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch -c /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf</p></blockquote>
<p>Which should spit out some &#8220;everything OK&#8221; messages.  If it didn&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll need to go back and check your configuration.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve switched the card to the proper setting, go ahead and use ifconfig to bring your wireless and wired network interfaces down (ifconfig eth0 down, etc.).  This step is optional, but I like to do it for good measure.</p>
<p>Now you should be ready to dial your wireless carrier.  To do so, simply execute &#8216;wvdial&#8217; and wait for the connection to finish.  You should be online at this point!</p>
<p>So there you have it.  I want to give a HUGE thanks to Mark Ziesemer for doing so much research on this card, that helped progress a TON!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you just got an HP Mini-Note 2133 pre-loaded with SLED 10?  Great, right?</p>
<p>Well&#8230;  It&#8217;s not been so great for a lot of people.  It seems that HP simply put this laptop together, half-assed a SLED load and sent it out into the wild.  I&#8217;ve had a ton of problems with it, the two major ones being that I couldn&#8217;t register the machine with the Novell Customer Center (not even with my site license) it ships with a non-working wireless card.</p>
<p>My wifi fix was simple, buy a new usb wifi dongle&#8230;  Registration, however, was a little easier to fix (after some wailing, gnashing of teeth, and chat in #opensuse-GNOME&#8230; thanks captiain_magnus!).</p>
<p>If you attempt to use YaST to register you copy of SLED on the 2133, you&#8217;ll be re-directed to a &#8220;special&#8221; Novell Customer Center login.  It&#8217;s a little different than the normal one in that it wants an HP license, not any other SLED license you may have.  The biggest difference, however, is that it&#8217;s broke.  It simply refreshes the page when you click submit and sends nothing to Novell.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re pretty sneaky about hiding your license number as well.  It happens to be on your restore DVD.  It&#8217;s located on the right hand side below the HP logo and the &#8220;2133&#8221; text.  It&#8217;s in a series something like NNNNNN-XNN, where N&#8217;s are numbers and X is some letter.</p>
<p>To get around the registration bug, have your license number handy and fire up your terminal.  Use &#8216;sudo&#8217; or just &#8216;su to root and issue the following command:</p>
<blockquote><p>suse_register -n -a serial-hp=NNNNNN-XNN</p></blockquote>
<p>Where &#8220;NNNNNN-XNN&#8221; is your registration code.  Sit back and wait, it took almost 20 minutes for this command to finish for me and you&#8217;ll receive absolutely no indication that it&#8217;s functioning.  Once it&#8217;s done, you&#8217;ll simply be returned to your prompt.  Fire up YaST or your favorite terminal emulator and check your repositories.  You should now have a Novell repository added.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s been <a href="http://www.suseblog.com/?p=477">some</a> <a href="http://forums.opensuse.org/tech-news/405088-wanted-build-service-contributors.html">discussion</a> about Rails on openSUSE recently, so I thought I&#8217;d add to my Ruby articles with a Rails installation guide.</p>
<p>Getting started with Rails on openSUSE is a breeze.  In this particular article, I&#8217;ll quickly outline installation and startup of Rails on openSUSE 11.1.  You&#8217;ll need to install Ruby, ruby-sqlite, and ruby gems.  I&#8217;ve detailed these in my <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2009/01/10/whats-green-red-and-awesome-all-over/">previous</a> <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2009/01/14/using-ruby-for-system-scripts/">articles</a> on <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2009/01/21/controlling-your-minions-with-ruby-and-capistrano/">ruby</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-338"></span></p>
<p>This is far easier than you might expect, so lets get started&#8230;</p>
<p>Use ruby gems to install Rails:</p>
<blockquote><p>sudo gem install rails</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s it!  After some work, Rails should be all installed and ready to go.  You can test it out by creating a new project:</p>
<blockquote><p>rails foobar</p></blockquote>
<p>And running the server script, then visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to verify that all is well:</p>
<blockquote><p>cd foobar &amp;&amp; ruby script/server</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that this installation will use sqlite3 as it&#8217;s database by default if you&#8217;ve been following my other tutorials.  There&#8217;s information about getting Rails to work with MySQL (and other databases/platforms) over at the Rails Wiki:  <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowtosInstallation">http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowtosInstallation</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As per the <a title="http://twitter.com/awafaa/status/1136640982" href="http://twitter.com/awafaa/status/1136640982">request</a> of <a title="http://lizards.opensuse.org/author/funkypenguin/" href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/author/funkypenguin/">Andrew Wafaa</a>, I thought I&#8217;d set up a quick guide to how I got teaming running on SLES.  The documentation for Teaming on the administrative end was relatively sparse, but the installation guide was sufficient for most purposes.</p>
<p>Read on to learn more about Teaming and SLES&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-371"></span></p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<p>Most of the Teaming documentation can be found here:  <a title="http://www.novell.com/documentation/team_plus_conf/" href="http://www.novell.com/documentation/team_plus_conf/">http://www.novell.com/documentation/team_plus_conf/</a></p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SLES (our server platform)</li>
<li>OES2 (not entirely important, but it knocks out a lot of the pre-reqs and gives you LDAP support if you have eDirectory running)</li>
<li>Teaming Licenses (a &#8220;starter pack&#8221; of 20 free licenses is available, contact your Novell vendor for more information)</li>
<li>I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re running the setup from a Linux box, but this isn&#8217;t 100% necessary</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preparing your installation<br />
</strong></p>
<p>There are a few things you need to do before getting started.  First being to install mysql:</p>
<blockquote><p># zypper in mysql mysql-client mysql-shared perl-DBD-mysql perl-DBI perl-Data-ShowTable libmysqlclient-devel</p>
<p># chkconfig &#8211;add mysql</p>
<p># /etc/init.d/mysql start</p>
<p># mysql_secure_installation</p></blockquote>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll need to edit your /etc/my.cnf to change the default character set support.  Add the following lines to /etcmy.cnf:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>[mysqld]
character_set_server = utf8
[client]
default_character_set = utf8
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, you&#8217;ll need to increase your open file limits in /etc/security/limits.conf:</p>
<ul>
<li> hard nofile 65535</li>
<li> soft nofile 4096</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>I like to run everything from a single location, so to kick things off, I created the directory &#8216;/incoming&#8217;.  Once there, you&#8217;ll need to download your copy of Teaming and extract it into this directory.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve gotten everything extracted, download your license file and copy it to the same directory, but make sure that you rename it to &#8220;license-key.xml&#8221;.  The Teaming installer will complain to no end if it&#8217;s unable to find this <em>exact </em>file in the install root.</p>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll need to make the installer executable:</p>
<blockquote><p># cd /incoming &amp;&amp; chmod 755 installer-liferay.linux</p></blockquote>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to run the installer.  The installer comes as a GUI package, but can be run via a text interface as well.  If you&#8217;re ssh&#8217;ing into your server to set up Teaming, you&#8217;ll want to forward X to allow the GUI to open (ssh -X -C user@server.com).  Otherwise, use the &#8216;-console&#8217; knob to initiate the text based installer.</p>
<blockquote><p># ./installer-liferay.linux</p>
<p>-or-</p>
<p># ./installer-liferay.linux -console</p></blockquote>
<p>I recommend choosing advanced options for install as it allows for greater flexibility in options.  Once you&#8217;ve followed through the installation steps (note, I installed mine copy into /opt/icecore), liferay/Teaming should be successfully installed.  Now you&#8217;ll need to start the server:</p>
<blockquote><p># /opt/icecore/<span class="literal">liferay-portal-tomcat-5.5-jdk5-4.3.0/bin/icecore start</span></p></blockquote>
<p>To ensure that Teaming starts on boot, issue the following commands:</p>
<blockquote><p># <span class="literal">cp /opt/icecore/liferay-portal-tomcat-5.5-jdk5-4.3.0/bin/icecore</span><span class="literal"> /etc/init.d</span></p>
<p># <span class="literal">chkconfig &#8211;add icecore</span></p></blockquote>
<p>After that, you should be able to start, stop, and restart &#8216;icecore&#8217;  using the /etc/init.d/icecore script.</p>
<p>At this point, Teaming should be up and running.  To access it and get started, open your browser and navigate to http://yourserver.com:8080 and log in as user admin with the password &#8216;admin&#8217; (no quotes).</p>
<p>Once logged in, you&#8217;ll need to pull the administrative modules down to your view by selecting the &#8216;Add Content&#8217; option in the upper right hand corner.  I like to use the shotgun method and add all of the administrative modules for my admin user.</p>
<p>So there you have it, a fresh Teaming install.  Enjoy!</p>
