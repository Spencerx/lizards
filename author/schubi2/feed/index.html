				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Hackweek">SUSE Hackweek</a> Vladislav Lewin (member of the YaST team) has had the nice idea writing a WebYaST plugin which provides a console terminal witch which the user has the opportunity to login on  a console on the target machine. He sould be able to start any console based application there ( of course even YaST :-))</p>
<p>So the benefit is to login on a target linux machine from a computer which</p>
<ul>
<li>has not to be a unix machine and</li>
<li>is without any VPN configuration stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just a simple Web browser is needed to get a login via the Web on another linux machine:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/terminal1.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-8196" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/terminal1-1024x911.jpg" alt="" width="717" height="638" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/terminal1-1024x911.jpg 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/terminal1-300x267.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/terminal1.jpeg 1122w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" /></a></p>
<p>Mainly the architecture is based on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/shellinabox/">shellinabox</a> which we have packaged together with the WebYaST Terminal Plugin. These RPMs are now available for download.</p>
<p>BTW: You will be surprised that the source code of the WebYaST Terminal Plugin has about 100 lines only !!!</p>
<p><strong>How to get:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All needed packages can be downloaded from <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=YaST%3AWeb%3AWebYaST"> OBS</a></li>
<li>The source code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/webyast/webyast/tree/master/plugins/terminal"> Github</a></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>WebYaST 0.3 is out</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;We have doubled the speed and have halved the memory usage&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/WebYaST2_screenshot2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8144" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/WebYaST2_screenshot2-1024x582.png" alt="" width="614" height="349" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/WebYaST2_screenshot2-1024x582.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/WebYaST2_screenshot2-300x170.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/WebYaST2_screenshot2.png 1270w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></a></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>The latest version of WebYaST has many<img src="../wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /> improvements regarding speed, memory usage, usability and developing environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed<br />
</strong>Due a new caching mechanism the startup time of each module has been decreased to a maximum of 1-2 seconds. So the user is able now to click through WebYaST without any notable waiting time.<br />
We have made a video which shows the speed improvement:<a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/webyast-comparison.swf"> WebYaST Comparison Video</a>For more technical information have a look to: <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:WebYaST_Caching"> WebYaST Caching Howto</a></li>
<li><strong>Memory Usage<br />
</strong>Former versions of WebYaST were split into a service and into an UI part. Each part has run in a own HTTP server. We have decided to bring these parts together in order to save one HTTP server which halves the memory usage.<br />
One additional benefit is that the architecture of WebYaST has simplified a lot:</li>
<li><strong>Simplifying WebYaST architecture<br />
</strong>Due the use of one HTTP WebYaST server only the development environment has been simplified very much:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setup an environment system is much more easier now. Even a setup based on the GIT repository is quite easy.<br />
For more information have a look to : <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:WebYaST_Installation#WebYaST_installation_version_.3E.3D_0.3"> WebYaST Installation</a></li>
<li>Writing an own WebYaST plugin has been reduced to a minimum effort. Everyone who has read a Ruby on Rails tutorial is now able to write a plugin.<br />
You do not believe ? Then have a look to the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:WebYaST_ExamplePlugin#Example_plugin_for_WebYaST_.3E.3D_0.3">Example plugin </a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to get:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All needed packages can be downloaded from <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=YaST%3AWeb%3AWebYaST"> OBS</a></li>
<li>The source code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/webyast/webyast"> Github</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Available for&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>.Sadly it is too late for 12.1 but you can install the packages from the repository described above for 11.4 and 12.1</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Have you ever tried WebYaST ? No ? Then it is time for. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong></p>
<p>We have noticed that WebYaST is not really known in the OpenSuSE community. One reason for is that WebYaST is not really user friendly regarding the installation.</p>
<p>So we have investigate here some effort. LetsÂ  see&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>The simplest way is the one-click installation which is already installed on your OpenSuSE 11.3.</p>
<p>Just use a web browser (like firefox) with the url:</p>
<p>http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/Web/openSUSE_11.3/webyast.ymp</p>
<p>The browser will ask you to start the installation via the one-click installation. Start the installation and go through the installation workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Starting and managing WebYaST</strong></p>
<p>WebYaST is a web application which runs on two http servers on your system. For starting and managing these servers Thomas Goettlicher has written a nice Qt-applet which can be started e.g. in KDE:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/qwebyast1.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6230" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/qwebyast1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/qwebyast1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/qwebyast1.jpeg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>After starting the WebYaST applet the WebYaST icon appears on the right edge of the frame :</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/qwebyast-disabled.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6231" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/qwebyast-disabled.png" alt="" width="32" height="32" /></a> WebYaST is disabled</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/qwebyast-enabled.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6232" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/qwebyast-enabled.png" alt="" width="32" height="32" /></a> WebYaST enabled</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">
<p>With the right mouse click you can manage WebYaST:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/qwebyast21.jpeg"><img class=" alignnone size-medium wp-image-6234" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/qwebyast21-300x230.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/qwebyast21-300x230.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/qwebyast21.jpeg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>With this applet you can start WebYaST in your browser too. After accepting the GPG-key please login with your &#8220;root&#8221; account.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s WebYaST:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/webyast.png"><img class=" alignnone size-medium wp-image-6250" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/webyast-300x234.png" alt="" width="300" height="234" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/webyast-300x234.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/webyast.png 767w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><em>That&#8217;s all.</em></p>
<p>(Yes, I know that sentence is written almost in every post here. Even in posts where problems just starting after the sentence has been read. :-))</p>
<p>But I think that should be <strong>really all</strong>. If not, please use bugzilla and blame us !</p>
<p><em>Have fun !</em></p>
<p>(Yes, I know that&#8217;s the second sentence which should be in every blog :-))<em><br />
</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After releasing WebYaST 1.0 last week we have had a look to the status module again and have come to the conclusion that we can do it better. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The current version looks more like a medical monitoring system that no one understand:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2828" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ugly-1024x805.png" alt="current status page" width="1024" height="805" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ugly-1024x805.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ugly-300x235.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ugly.png 1161w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><strong>Technical background</strong></p>
<p>The system data will be collected by a service called <em>collectd</em> (www.collectd.org). This data will be stored in a rrd-database which is located in</p>
<p>/var/lib/collectd/&lt;system-name&gt;/[cpu-0|cpu-1|df|interface|load|memory|&#8230;.]</p>
<p>An own file/database will for each value will be generated.</p>
<p>The upper screen shot shows that an own graphic will be shown for each value. This is not really user friendly. We would like to show only values which provides &#8220;really&#8221; interesting information for the sysadmin or user. These values should also be grouped in order to reduce the amount of graphs.</p>
<p>Another lack of information is the labeling of the graphs. There is no description what the values mean and in which period they have been evaluated.</p>
<p><strong>The aim</strong></p>
<p>would be to give the user a nice overview about the system status. Additional, there should be an alarm system available if system values are exceeded. E.g. there should be sent an email to the system administrator if no disk space is available anymore.<br />
The Administrator should also be able to configure &#8220;his&#8221; needed system values in a nice way.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion for configuration</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2834" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/configure-1024x867.png" alt="configure" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/configure-1024x867.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/configure-300x254.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/configure.png 1121w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>There are three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>General<br />
General setting like period time of shown data, email address in the case of occurred errors and the color of displayed limits.</li>
<li>Graphics<br />
Defining graphs with</p>
<ul>
<li>labels</li>
<li>scales</li>
<li>flag for cumulate values<br />
This means that the values in the graph are added. E.g. the component <em>df </em>of <em>collectd</em> returns two values of a partition (free, used). These values will be cumulated in the graph like this:<br />
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2844" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/collecdtd1-300x92.png" alt="collecdtd disk status" width="300" height="92" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/collecdtd1-300x92.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/collecdtd1.png 476w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enable Values/Limits
<ul>
<li> Defining which data of <em>collectd</em> will be shown in the graphics described above. This enable us to group data in one graph, defining color and label of each <em>collectd</em> value:<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2855" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/collecdtd3.png" alt="collecdtd cpu2" width="462" height="149" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/collecdtd3.png 462w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/collecdtd3-300x96.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px" /></li>
<li>Defining limits and send an email if the value is overstepped longer than the defined period (Alarm after (min.))</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Result</strong></p>
<p>should be an amount of <strong>view</strong> graphs which include interesting data <strong>only</strong>. These values are checked periodically and an email will be sent if they exceed a defined limit.</p>
<p><strong>I am asking for</strong></p>
<p>your opinion about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you know a much more fancy way for displaying system status data ?</li>
<li>Which kind of Data would be interesting for you (CPU, memory, disk-space,&#8230;.)?</li>
<li>When and for which kind of data would you like to get an email if limits have been exceeded?</li>
</ul>
<p>So, before changing this module we would like to ask <strong>you</strong> what you would like to see. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Aim</strong></h2>
<p>First of all we want to provide an general web based interface with the<br />
functionality which is already provided by the YaST command line interface.</p>
<p>This API is based on the REST (Representational state transfer) architecture. This is a<br />
simple interface which transmits domain-specific data over HTTP.<br />
Please have a look to</p>
<p><a href="http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer</a></p>
<p>for more information about REST.</p>
<p>The second aim is to provide a YaST Web UI which can be used by every<br />
web browser.</p>
<p>The current state of the project is an existing YaST-Webservice on the<br />
host side which provides the REST based interface.<br />
On the client side we have the concerning YaST-Webclient which can be<br />
used be any web browser.</p>
<p>YaST-Webservice and YaST-Webclient are running as a webserver<br />
(currently lighttpd) on different or even the same computer.</p>
<p>So the aim is to configure a host via the internet in a simple and<br />
safety way.</p>
<h2><strong>How does it work ?</strong></h2>
<p><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/yastwebservice.png" alt="YaST Web" width="810" height="1146" /></p>
<p>The YaST Webclient communicate via HTTP(s) with the YaST Webservice. The<br />
user has to authenticate ( username, password ) to the host via PAM<br />
(Pluggable Authentication Modules) which is available on every linux system.</p>
<p>The YaST Webclient sends requests ( e.g. create a user, install patch) to<br />
the YaST Webservice. This service checks if the user has the right to<br />
execute this request via PolicyKit. For each kind of request there is<br />
PolicyKit rule defined. These rights has to be granted to the concerning user.</p>
<p>After permission check the request will be send via DBUS to the SCR agent of<br />
YaST. The return value will be given back to YaST-Webclient in XML or JSON<br />
format.</p>
<p>Patches will be handled by PackageKit. These requests will also be sent from<br />
the YaST Webservice to PackageKit via DBUS.</p>
<h2><strong>How to get it ?</strong></h2>
<p>Have a look the openSUSE buildservice project</p>
<p><a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Aschubi2">YaST Webservice (home:schubi2)</a></p>
<p>There are all needed packages for version openSuSE 11.1 and above.</p>
<p>As some additional packages (e.g. lighttpd) are needed which are not on openSuSE 11.1 you should add a<br />
repositories ( e.g. factory ) in order to provide these packages.<br />
The simplest way for installation would be to use zypper:</p>
<p>zypper in yast2-core-2*.rpm<br />
zypper in ruby-dbus-*.rpm<br />
zypper in yast2-webservice-*.rpm<br />
zypper in yast2-webclient-*.rpm</p>
<h2><strong>How to use the YaST-Webservice</strong></h2>
<p>After you have installed these packages you can start the YaST-Webservice-Server with</p>
<p>rcyastws start</p>
<p>The server is running as &#8220;localhost:8080&#8221; with which you can connect with a web browser:</p>
<p>http://localhost:8080</p>
<p><img style="1px solid black;" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/webui4.jpg" alt="YaST-Webservice" width="1065" height="616" /></p>
<p>This &#8220;pure&#8221; web page shows the available modules which can be used via the REST interface.</p>
<p>This REST API is described under</p>
<p>http://localhost:8080/doc_interface.html</p>
<p>Additional configuration stuff like</p>
<p>&#8211; setup Hostname and Port<br />
&#8211; setup HTTPS connection<br />
&#8211; granting permissions for an single user<br />
&#8211; AVAHI support</p>
<p>can be found here:<br />
http://localhost:8080/doc_config.html</p>
<h2><strong>How to use the YaST-Webclient</strong></h2>
<p>After you have started the YaST-Webservice-Server you also can start the YaST-Webclient:</p>
<p>rcyastwc start</p>
<p>Now you can use any browser and connect with http://&lt;name of your computer&gt; to your<br />
computer.<br />
The default rights of the YaST Webservice are set to root only. So you can login with the root password<br />
of that machine.</p>
<p>Following features are implemented:</p>
<p>&#8211; setting languages<br />
&#8211; setting system time<br />
&#8211; setting user permissions<br />
&#8211; installing patches<br />
&#8211; managing local users<br />
&#8211; export user SSH-keys<br />
&#8211; starting,stopping,status,&#8230; of services<br />
&#8211; configuration of ntp server</p>
<p>Have a look to the following screen shot it order to give an overview how it looks like:</p>

<p><strong>Known Bugs</strong><br />
-The first call of an menue entry will be slow cause an additional process will be started.<br />
The second one should be much more faster <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
-Permissions will sometime not be shown correctly (just click &#8220;search&#8221; again) Bug 470645</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to give an answer about &#8220;Why this package will be installed and who needs it?&#8221; I have added a new Dialog in the QT single package selector:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-86" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog-300x193.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog.jpg 1184w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Select one item (pattern, package) in the single selection frame, use the right mouse button and select &#8220;Show solver information&#8221;. A solverrun will be made for this item and the result will be shown with this dialog.</p>
<ul>
<li>Black arrow : This item will be required by&#8230;.</li>
<li>Green arrow: This item will be recommended by&#8230;</li>
<li>Green boxes: This package is already installed</li>
<li>Grey boxes: This package will be installed</li>
<li>Blue boxes: Patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>You can navigate through the tree via the overview frame:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog81.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-88" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog81-206x300.jpg" alt="" width="206" height="300" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog81-206x300.jpg 206w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog81.jpg 369w" sizes="(max-width: 206px) 100vw, 206px" /></a></p>
<p>After you have selected one item in the tree you can see more information about:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-89" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog2-300x67.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="67" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog2-300x67.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog2.jpg 565w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>e.G. this item will install two further patterns due to the shown dependencies.</p>
<p>In order to decrease the complexity of the tree you can blind out:</p>
<ul>
<li>already installed packages</li>
<li>recommended packages/patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>So you will get a shrinked tree:</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-90" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog6-291x300.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="300" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog6-291x300.jpg 291w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/dialog6.jpg 709w" sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Technical Background:</strong></p>
<p>This is a simple Qt Dialog widget which can be used in other programs too. ( Package libqdialogsolver1)</p>
<p>YaST uses this widget as a YaST plugin. So if this package is not available you will get a popup in single selection <em>only.</em></p>
