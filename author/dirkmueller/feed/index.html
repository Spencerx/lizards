				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy,</p>
<p>the openSUSE on ARM team was quite busy the last few weeks with getting openSUSE 12.3 for AArch64 (ARM64, also called ARMv8) ready. At the time of this post, we have finished around 4100 packages (out of ~ 6000) of openSUSE 12.3 built for AArch64, the ARM 64bit platform. With those successfully built packages, we&#8217;re also able to build a regular openSUSE image for you to try and run in the ARMv8 System emulator (ARMv8 Foundation Model).</p>
<p>This is a huge achievement and milestone for us, thanks to lots of helpful hands within openSUSE. Just to put this into perspective: This is not a minimal system with a couple of toolchain packages. It is also not an embedded variant of a Linux environment. No, this is the <strong>full featured, standard openSUSE distribution</strong> as you&#8217;re used to, ported to AArch64, up and running. We have built it based on (slightly newer versions of) standard openSUSE 12.3 packages, and the changes are mostly already merged back into openSUSE Factory. For all we know it’s also more successful package builds than any other Linux distribution has on AArch64! If you’d like to see the status yourself, please check out <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=devel%3AARM%3AAArch64%3A12.3">the OBS repository we created for this</a>.</p>
<p>As an open distribution, it is important to make contributions easy and we worked hard to enable others to participate in our effort. We extended OBS to automatically spawn a <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/tools/models/fast-models/foundation-model.php">Foundation Model</a> virtual machine when you want to build for aarch64. This works remotely on the OBS server as well as locally using osc build. More information on this is available on the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM/AArch64">respective wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>So, dive right into it:  Get the image and start with openSUSE on AArch64 by following our wiki page: <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM/AArch64">https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:ARM/AArch64</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Out of total insanity I promised Adrian a couple of weeks ago to test local installation of the OBS build service and interconnect it with the build.opensuse.org instance. Last night I couldn&#8217;t sleep due to the heat, so I finally did. Half an hour later, everything was installed and set up correctly according to the README.SETUP instructions in the obs-server package. I&#8217;ve fixed a couple of small issues in the README while doing so.</p>
<p>This morning, Michael Schroeder fixed the remaining bugs in the scheduler so that it actually runs. And now it builds <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Source and binary interconnects work fine, so I can e.g. branch a package that is somewhere in the openSUSE buildservice (some KDE:KDE4: package or even openSUSE:Factory) and modify it locally in a test project, and watch the resulting build failures. There are some smaller issues with &#8220;osc linkpac&#8221; and &#8220;osc branch&#8221;, but editing the _link  files directly works.This way one can do experimental changes to packaging without actually breaking the repository for all other users, or slow down the build power ressources for everybody else due to unnecessary rebuilds.</p>
<p>As a test case, I&#8217;ve imported KDE 4.0.5 packages into a local branch of KDE:KDE4:STABLE:Desktop for testing. More seems possible, like for example doing a daily rebuild of the KDE 4.</p>
<p>Really cool stuff. Buildservice guys, keep rocking!</p>
