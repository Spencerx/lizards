				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first Kokoa and Friends meeting took place the 20th of December at the Computing and Electrical Department of ESPOL.<br />
This meeting supported by the openSUSE community, gathered people from different levels of the Kokoa community and the ESPOL university. From students that are just getting interested in using FLOSS (a.k.a. newbies), students who are &#8220;candidates&#8221; to join the Kokoa community, the current &#8220;active&#8221; members and the experienced &#8220;senior&#8221; members.<br />
In this event different topics were discussed covering FLOSS usage in the academia and the industry. Stories of success and guidelines were shared with people interested in going forward in the world of FLOSS.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Cristina Guerrero, Nervo Verdezoto, Marisol Villacrés, and from <a title="jarflex" href="http://www.jarflex.ec/">Jarflex</a>, Adonis Figueroa and Jessica Zuñiga the speakers of this meeting and specially to Arturo Tumbaco, who helped me with the logistics to make this event possible.</p>
<p>Here some pictures about the meeting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know, I know&#8230; it is a bit late ( more than a month ) since FLISOL took place in Guayaquil-Ecuador this year&#8230; but a lot a time consuming activities have stopped me from reporting some results. Even though more than a month have passed,  I think I should let you know what happened.</p>
<p>Compared to previous years, the event of this year was relatively smaller. An approximate of 200 people assisted, from which for the ~80% it was their first time that assisted to FLISOL, 50% of visitors had not used or heard about  FLOSS before, ~13% were below 18 years old and ~75% were between 18-35 years old.</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/oSmerchandising.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4229" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/oSmerchandising.jpg" alt="" width="148" height="198" /></a> <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/flisolregistrer.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4230" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/flisolregistrer-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a> <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Jarflex-svn.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4231" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Jarflex-svn-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="198" /></a></p>

<p>There are 3 things that I would like to point from this year&#8217;s event:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most of the event was organized by the new members from <a title="KOKOA ESPOL" href="http://kokoa.espol.edu.ec/">Kokoa</a> ( ESPOL&#8217;s Free Software Community ), who I send my congratulations since it was a very good start. They were just newbies and took the challenge of  organizing the biggest FLOSS event in town. As an old Kokoa kore member I know how difficult can be to organize FLISOL, and I can say those guys did a good job.</li>
<li>One of the rooms that caught most of the attention of the visitors was the gaming room. It mostly attracted the young visitors from different genres.  I think that gnu/linux is a niche that has started to be exploited in the gaming area. Personally I have tried some games since the very first time I had openSUSE (SuSE Linux back then) installed and I have seen how good known titles and good quality indie games are coming to gnu/linux. I think that with <a title="openSUSE GameStore" href="http://gamestore.gk2.sk/" target="_blank">openSUSE GameStore</a> , some gamers and developers from the openSUSE community we can try to promote our lovely green as a good platform for gaming.</li>
<li>Last but not least, I would like to say thanks to <a title="jarflex.ec" href="http://jarflex.ec/">Jarflex, </a><a href="http://blog.espol.edu.ec/culturadigital/">ESPOL&#8217;s Digital Culture Club</a>, <a href="http://www.ecuagamers.com/">Ecuagamers</a> and all the people who contributed to  make this event possible.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/fof.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4226" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/fof-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="144" /></a> <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/FOFwinners.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4227" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/FOFwinners-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="265" height="148" /></a> <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/girlsgammers2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4228" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/girlsgammers2-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="144" /></a></p>
<p>Summarizing, this year it was seen a collaboration between different groups and enterprises somehow related to FLOSS that , locally, was not seen before. This might be a further step of what was started in 2007 when we tried to take FLISOL from a FLOSS installation festival for FLOSS enthusiast to a FLOSS event that will catch the attention of people of different ages with different interests.</p>
<p>Until the next post people of the openSUSEsphere&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the last week blogs, twitter, facebook and other means of communication for the users experienced a lot of traffic related to the <a href="http://www.wolfire.com/humble">Humble Indie Bundle</a>. This bundle was nothing more than a package composed of 6 DRM-Free games developed by 6 Independent game developers that could be obtained at a price set by the user. This bundle included the games <a href="http://2dboy.com/games.php">World of Goo</a>, <a href="http://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria/">Aquaria</a>, <a href="http://www.crypticsea.com/gish/">Gish</a>, <a href="http://www.wolfire.com/lugaru">Lugaru HD</a>, <a href="http://www.penumbragame.com/">Penumbra Overture</a> and <a href="http://www.amanita-design.net/samorost-2/">Samorost 2</a>. The bundle was available for one week and the earnings went to the developers, The <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child&#8217;s Play Charit</a>y and <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> depending on the will of the buyer. At the end of the week the bundle reached 1&#8217;000.000 US$ of income, reason for which <a href="http://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria/">Aquaria</a>, <a href="http://www.crypticsea.com/gish/">Gish</a>, <a href="http://www.wolfire.com/lugaru">Lugaru HD</a> and <a href="http://www.penumbragame.com/">Penumbra Overture</a> are releasing their code under FLOSS licenses. As you can see <a href="http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/05/Lugaru-goes-open-source">here</a> was already released under GPL2, and the other games source code is being prepared to be released within this week.</p>
<p><img src="http://alexnevsky.com/articles/indie/images/aquaria.jpg" alt="" width="237" height="171" /> <img class="alignnone" src="http://www.downloadgames2008.com/pic/645Thumb2.jpg" alt="Gish" width="231" height="173" /> <img class="alignnone" src="http://www.wolfire.com/lugaru/screens/12.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="172" /> <img class="alignnone" src="http://www.manifestogames.com/system/files/images/overture_toilet.preview.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="170" /></p>
<p>In addition to this, it was <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=valve_steam_announcement&amp;num=1">officially</a> announced that Steam will be available for Linux at the end of this summer, which means lots of games and lots of fun is coming to gnu/linux and the breach in gaming between gnu/linux and other OSs is getting smaller.</p>
<p>Here some trailers of the games that will be released as FLOSS  from the Humble Indie Bundle</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyZJo7RpCwo">Aquaria</a> |  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WzGQQOIcp8">Gish</a> |  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWTxaAj5w-4">Lugaru HD</a> |   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPJKrR2K_c">Penumbra Overture</a></p>
<p>Linux gamers it is time to have even more fun</p>

<dl>
<dt><img class="alignleft" src="http://flisol.net/FLISOL2010/Ecuador/Guayaquil?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=banner2010gyewiki.png" alt="" width="380" height="441" />Similar to more than 20 cities in Ecuador and 17 countries in Latin America, <a title="about Guayaquil" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guayaquil" target="_blank">Guayaquil</a> is preparing to join the celebration of <a title="abou FLISOL" href="http://flisol.net/" target="_blank">FLISOL 2010</a>. This year, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of <a title="about ESPOL" href="http://www.espol.edu.ec/">ESPOL</a> will be the home of  the event in Guayaquil. The event is coordinated in Guayaquil by Prof. Dr. Daniel Ochoa, current leader of <a title="about KOKOA" href="http://kokoa.espol.edu.ec/" target="_blank">KOKOA</a> (ESPOL&#8217;s Free Software Community). For this edition, there will be divided in four areas targeting different user interests.</dt>
</dl>
</div>
<p><strong>Area 1:</strong> Talks</p>
<p>For this year we have on schedule around <a title="FLISOL2010-GYE talks list" href="http://flisolgye.espol.edu.ec/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=3" target="_blank">22 talks</a> (splited in 3 tracks) covering different topics of FLOSS. This year, the talks track will be featuring Jossie, a FLOSS CMS to develop accessible websites that developed in Ecuador. Another main talk is given by  Luis Galarraga explaining his experiences while leading the <a title="about J!Research" href="http://joomla-research.com/" target="_blank">J!Research</a> project, which is a Joomla extension that is being used by an increasing number of research-related institutions. Following by the presentation of the findings on using FLOSS on education. Something that I am happy to say is that the number of talks is increasing every year, so hopefully in 5 years the FLISOL event of Guayaquil might scale to a higher level.</p>
<p><strong>Area 2:</strong> Workshops</p>
<p>This area  is aimed for different users, but most of them are oriented to experienced users. This year we have on schedule <a title="FLISOL2010-GYE workshops list" href="http://flisolgye.espol.edu.ec/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=4" target="_blank">6 workshops</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Area 3:</strong> Demo/Gaming room</p>
<p>This is a must-visit place for the young ones and a proof that &#8220;Hey!!! it is possible to play video games on GNU/Linux&#8221;.  <a title="FLISOL2010-GYE demo/game list" href="http://flisolgye.espol.edu.ec/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=6" target="_blank">This area</a> will be the home of small tournaments in the games <a href="http://fretsonfire.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Frets on Fire</a>, <a href="http://openarena.ws/smfnews.php" target="_blank">OpenArena</a> and <a href="http://supertuxkart.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Super Tuxkart</a>, where participants will be able to earn small FLOSS related prizes. In addition to this, visitors will be able to test some desktop environments and cool apps.</p>
<p><strong>Area 4:</strong> Installation Party</p>
<p>Last but not the least, and the reason that drove FLISOL on first place, the installation Party. The  installation party is complemented by a cross-distro stand were users are explained the main features of each distro in  order to ease their decision in the moment of the installation party. During the installation, the users receive a brief introduction to GNU/Linux and are assisted on its installation. This year, the available distros are: openSUSE, Fedora, (k)ubuntu, CentOS and Debian.</p>
<p>In addition to this, for those who are not so sure if it&#8217;s their time to move to FLOSS, KOKOA prepare the KOKOA Toolkit, which is a CD with Free Software and tutorials that can be installed on windows. This gives the users the chance to taste the power of FLOSS and help in their transition decision :D.</p>
<p>The time keeps going and that moment in the year when all Latin America joins to celebrate a FLOSS party has arrived.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is almost one week after the 10th edition <a href="http://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> (Free Software Developers European Meeting) (http://fosdem.org/2010/) took place in the city of Brussels. As is usual, lots of Free Software developers, promotors and fans attended to the event. Different from other years, this time I had the chance to live on my own the  FOSDEM spirit and had the chance to meet some FLOSS supporters from different projects, seeing the almighty improved KDE 4.4 being successfully presented under 640&#215;480 adverse projecting conditions. In addition to this, lots of openSUSE people at the openSUSE booth</p>
<p>For those of you who couldn&#8217;t attend to FOSDEM or for those who attended and want to see it again, <a href="http://video.fosdem.org/2010/"> here</a> some of the videos of the talks are available for download. Additionally, you can visit the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/fosdemtalks">official FOSDEM youtube channel</a>, enjoy&#8230; and don&#8217;t forget: Have a lot of fun</p>
