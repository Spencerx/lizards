				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you already know, the Festival Latinoamericano de Instalacion de Software Libre event will be held this Saturday here in Chile.</p>
<p>In La Serena we are starting around 9 am at Universidad de La Serena campus Isabel Bongard, with plenty of fun talks and room for installations, I am more than ready to install our awesome green! =). By the way, I will be creating an ISO with SUSE Studio so everyone can grab it on USB devices.</p>
<p>Some talk topics we are presenting: KVM, Free Knowledge, Linux beyond the Desktop, and Contributing to openSUSE without having to be a developer.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Andreas and everyone at Novell who has been supporting the Ambassadors Program, shipping DVDs, Geekos, T-shirts that the audience really appreciates and do make a difference.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alright. Just out of curiosity, I felt like finding out what the numbers show for South America compared to other  regions in the Ambassadors Program of openSUSE.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the goals of the Ambassador Program are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Act as an evangelist for openSUSE to the public.</li>
<li>Mentor new users and contributors.</li>
<li>Support openSUSE at local events.</li>
<li>Promote use of openSUSE and contributions to the openSUSE Project.</li>
<li>Have a lot of fun!.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, checking out the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Ambassador/List">Ambassadors List</a>, I got for South America:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brazil = 6.</li>
<li>Chile = 3.</li>
<li>Peru = 3.</li>
<li>Argentina = 2.</li>
<li>Colombia = 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brazil is doing great here, doubling any other country&#8217;s Ambassadors number in the region. No doubt it&#8217;s not just users who are pushing Open Source out there but also their government and enterprises (example:<a href="www.fisl.org.br/">Fisl</a>), and I am glad openSUSE is a real choice for them. Compared to Europe, I believe statistical numbers are still OK for us <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> since the truth is that openSUSE is just ranked in the top five of the most popular Linux flavours in Chile, maybe it&#8217;s the same in other South America countries. So, Ambassadors for Europe (some countries only):</p>
<ul>
<li>Germany = 8.</li>
<li>Spain = 6.</li>
<li>Austria = 4.</li>
<li>Italy = 3.</li>
<li>France = 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for North America, we have got:</p>
<ul>
<li>USA = 15.</li>
<li>Canada = 3.</li>
<li>Mexico = 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>I even did a &#8220;quick and dirt&#8221; chart with OpenOffice&#8217;s Calc so you can have a graphical idea of our numbers around the world:</p>
<p><img src="http://ricardovs.wordpress.com/files/2009/10/ambassadorschart01.png" alt="ambassadorschart01" width="1001" height="356" /><br />

<p>Have a lot of fun!.</p>

<p>First of all, go to the Control Center, and look up for the Mouse item. Then click on Touchpad (obviously not using your computer&#8217;s touchpad, heh) and mark the option Enable mouse clicks with touchpad. That&#8217;d work fine <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>I must thank my friend Pedro Villavicencio of Ubuntu for letting me know about this solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And the day came. After a six hours trip on bus, and a few minutes of sleep I got to Santiago de Chile. Francisco Toha picked me up so we headed to Universidad Andres Bello for the openSUSE Day. Huge building and plenty of room for everyone. The event started almost on time. I followed the first talk, a bit hoping to have a decent internet connection so I could show a live SUSE Studio test drive. OK, that didn&#8217;t happen. The internet traffic ratio was too slow like waiting 59 minutes to build an JeOS appliance was nuts so that was definitely the low aspect of the talk.<br />
Again, huge thanks to Zonker for all the support. openSUSE 11.1 DVDs and stickers were cool and all loved it. Also big thanks everyone from  <a href="http://www.geekos.cl">Geeko&#8217;s</a>, specially Enrique Herrera, Jose MuÃ±oz, and Francisco Toha. Statistic and evaluation have not been finished yet. Anyway, some pictures here:<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, today I downloaded the Gnome Live CD first, and had no luck at all. That was no fun watching the busy cursor over and over again after selecting the Live CD option from the Menu so I decided to get the DVD just to see if things went different (actually not the only reason for), and sure they were. First, I installed the KDE Desktop, not a deal through the install process. Then came the first log in and all well. Of course I chose the Ext4 file system and I can tell it feels faster than our good old Ext3 ;).</p>
<p>Then it was time for Gnome. As usual, default install took longer than KDE&#8217;s. One thing I removed from the software was Desktop Effects, since I started to believe that that could cause the problem with the Live CD Media. So on through the install process, it went down really well. Then at first log in I got alerted over GDM and Metacity. I got this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-128" src="http://ricardovs.wordpress.com/files/2009/05/waring_metacity.png" alt="waring_metacity" width="450" height="142" /></p>
<p>By default, the Slab Menu Icon looks like this when Main Panel&#8217;s Size is 24 pixels:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-129" src="http://ricardovs.wordpress.com/files/2009/05/computer_icon24.png" alt="Computer_icon24" width="99" height="30" /></p>
<p>Looks like your computer is not your computer, right? Well, I just resized Main Panel up to 26 pixels so it looks like better:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130" src="http://ricardovs.wordpress.com/files/2009/05/computer_icon26.png" alt="Computer_icon26" width="98" height="32" /></p>
<p>I must admit that I like the default theme. Absolutely new, darkish, professional. First time I feel comfortable &#8220;out of the box&#8221;. One feature that is not workig 100% is the System Monitor. At this time I cannot switch between tabs. The rest of the system is pretty running smoothly to me. Here you have a screenshot of my desktop:</p>
