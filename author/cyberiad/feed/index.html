				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is quite some buzz around docker and no one can avoid to read about it. So I wanted to try it out. Since version 1.0 is now out some things got even smoother it seems.<br />
Here is the short version of the commands:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the Virtualization repository
<pre>zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Virtualization/openSUSE_13.1 docker
zypper ref</pre>
</li>
<li>Install docker
<pre>zypper in docker</pre>
</li>
<li>Start the docker service
<pre>systemctl start docker</pre>
</li>
<li>Then for example search for openSUSE based containers in the docker registry
<pre>docker search opensuse</pre>
<p>This should provide the same list as using this web page:</p>
<p><a title="https://registry.hub.docker.com/" href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/">https://registry.hub.docker.com/</a></li>
<li>For now we are going to download and use Flavio Castelli&#8217;s 12.3 container by first pulling it
<pre>docker pull flavio/opensuse-12-3</pre>
<p>Depending on your connection that may take some time or finish quite quickly with output looking like this:</p>
<pre># docker pull flavio/opensuse-12-3
 Pulling repository flavio/opensuse-12-3
 7b4864b5c142: Download complete
 3ac0450b90b3: Download complete</pre>
</li>
<li>If that worked well, you are ready to use that container. For example check what RPM&#8217;s are installed by simply issuing
<pre> docker run flavio/opensuse-12-3 rpm -qa</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you are ready to pull and use containers. If you want to build your own containers the following blog post by Flavio Castelli might be of interest to you:</p>
<p><a title="Building Docker Containers With KIWI" href="http://flavio.castelli.name/2014/05/06/building-docker-containers-with-kiwi/" target="_blank">http://flavio.castelli.name/2014/05/06/building-docker-containers-with-kiwi/</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After having read an answer containing a rude &#8220;RTFM&#8221; on one of the openSUSE mailing lists I think I have to make a point. A very important one, since it seems to become a habit to be brief and put information into single spots only, which might be found with Google.</p>
<p>Helping users, and I don&#8217;t mean only new users, cannot be done with pointing them to Google all the time unless it&#8217;s a very well-known issue. A Unix system like Linux comes from a very good tradition of man pages, howtos and other local information e.g. files in /usr/share/doc/packages/. Unfortunately this tradition seems to be dying. This wouldn&#8217;t be dramatic if there would be more openSUSE specific documentation, but this is not the case. It&#8217;s either brief, old or fragmented over the net in blogs or mailing list archives. Especially the latter may be a good source for solving problems, but some threads are filled with long discussions and the satisfied solution cannot be found with a few glimpses or even clicks.</p>
<p>Therefore all of us need to write more documentation that can be found easily and at best on *.opensuse.org servers. Otherwise the search function there is pointless. The best place for documenting solutions to common and not-so-common problems is the support database in the openSUSE wiki:</p>
<p><a title="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Support_database" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Support_database" target="_blank">http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Support_database</a></p>
<p>Writing things in your personal blog is good and welcome, but at the same time there should be an SDB article about the provided solution.</p>
<p>I have to add that there are a lot of people who already put a lot of effort into documenting things. This post is not to criticize, but to support them, so that there are not only a few who contribute valuable help to users.</p>
