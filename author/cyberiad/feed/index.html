				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After having read an answer containing a rude &#8220;RTFM&#8221; on one of the openSUSE mailing lists I think I have to make a point. A very important one, since it seems to become a habit to be brief and put information into single spots only, which might be found with Google.</p>
<p>Helping users, and I don&#8217;t mean only new users, cannot be done with pointing them to Google all the time unless it&#8217;s a very well-known issue. A Unix system like Linux comes from a very good tradition of man pages, howtos and other local information e.g. files in /usr/share/doc/packages/. Unfortunately this tradition seems to be dying. This wouldn&#8217;t be dramatic if there would be more openSUSE specific documentation, but this is not the case. It&#8217;s either brief, old or fragmented over the net in blogs or mailing list archives. Especially the latter may be a good source for solving problems, but some threads are filled with long discussions and the satisfied solution cannot be found with a few glimpses or even clicks.</p>
<p>Therefore all of us need to write more documentation that can be found easily and at best on *.opensuse.org servers. Otherwise the search function there is pointless. The best place for documenting solutions to common and not-so-common problems is the support database in the openSUSE wiki:</p>
<p><a title="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Support_database" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Support_database" target="_blank">http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Support_database</a></p>
<p>Writing things in your personal blog is good and welcome, but at the same time there should be an SDB article about the provided solution.</p>
<p>I have to add that there are a lot of people who already put a lot of effort into documenting things. This post is not to criticize, but to support them, so that there are not only a few who contribute valuable help to users.</p>
