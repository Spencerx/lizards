				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you possibly know, the last openSUSE release does not include HAL layer which was employed by multiple software to access hardware components. This heavily impacted the KDE 3 users who became unable to suspend and hibernate their systems without installing HAL from a separate repository. Now, thanks to a patch developed by Serghei Amelian, KDE3 got the support for the modern hardware interface, Upower. The update is already published for openSUSE 12.1.<br />
<a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/screen43.png"><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/screen43-1024x640.png" alt="" width="512" height="320" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8565" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/screen43-1024x640.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/screen43-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></p>
<p>Among other improvements to KDE3 is the possibility to resize tray icons by editing (or creating) the config file ~/.kde/share/config/systemtray_panelappletrc with the following section: </p>
<p>[System Tray]<br />
systrayIconWidth=XX</p>
<p>where XX is the preferred icon size. While in the previous KDE3 releases the icons would got cut, they are scaled now. I changed the default size of the tray icons to 18 px so that they could fit in two rows at medium panel size (see the screenshot).</p>
<p>I also removed the annoying arrows from the applet handles so they not to damage the common style. The applet menu still can be called by right-clicking on the handle.<br />
One additional improvement is that kpdf now got the ability to rotate the document.</p>

<p>The image includes openSUSE-specific presets and an auto-updater applet which allows to keep your installation up-to-date.</p>
<p>Since the final KDE3 release KDE3 in openSUSE repository undergone several changes.</p>
<p>The most visible fixes include the appearance of the &#8220;classic&#8221; style of the taskbar (the button of the active window now appears pushed, something that was broke in the last KDE3 release); the selection of the icons on the desktop now resembles the style used in the file manager with rounded corners. The LiveDVD ships with openSUSE artwork and exclusive openSUSE-style window decorations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated to openSUSE 12.1 I found myself feeling nostalgia about Gnome 2 which was featured as part of openSUSE 11.4. I quickly enabled openSUSE 11.4 repository and carefully installed Gnome 2 packages from there. After installing each package I barred version modification and thoroughly checked so that no Gnome 3 packages installed. After work done I found that Gnome 2.32 works under openSUSE 12.1 pretty well without visible glitches.</p>
