				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have not been actively participating in openSUSE project for some time now, as a result there has not been much to blog about on <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/author/cyberorg">openSUSE Lizards blog</a>, there is a new blog at <a href="https://cyberorg.wordpress.com">https://cyberorg.wordpress.com</a> to blog about what I have been and will be up to with Li-f-e: Linux for Education project among other things. I am also now &#8220;<a href="https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2016-03/msg00036.html">Member Emeritus</a>&#8221; of the openSUSE community due to lack of participation, so cyberorg@opensuse.org email address will no longer work, please use @cyberorg.info if you need to get in touch with me.</p>
<p>After almost a decade of bringing you Li-f-e: Linux for Education based on openSUSE, it is now based on Ubuntu MATE LTS releases. I hope to provide the same excellent user experience that you have come to expect. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberorg-home/files/Li-f-e/">Download it from here</a>. Reason for this change is mentioned in <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2016/07/04/future-of-li-f-e-linux-for-education-distribution/">previous post</a> and it&#8217;s discussion(lack of interest/time/skills by anyone for maintaining live installer). You can of course easily enable Education Build Service repository to install packages on standard openSUSE or use <a href="https://susestudio.com/">susestudio</a> to create your own spin with Education packages.</p>
<p>To new beginnings&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tools to create multi distribution bootable USB stick got couple of new improvements and features.</p>
<p><a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/live-usb-gui">live-usb-gui</a> now offers choice of scripts to use, depending in your need you can either use <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/live-fat-stick">live-fat-stick</a> with vfat partitioned stick or <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/live-grub-stick">live-grub-stick</a> script which works with any partition format supported by grub2 including vfat, must be used if you have iso bigger than 4G.</p>
<p><span id="more-11931"></span>live-grub-stick can now create bootable USB from openSUSE installation media isos (standard DVD or NET), difference from <code>--isohybrid</code> option is that the data already on the stick is not touched, the whole iso is available on the stick so you can use the stick to copy it around apart from being able to install from it.</p>
<p>Two new options <code>--suse-persistent</code>(for openSUSE live ISOs) and <code>--ubuntu-persistent</code>(for Ubuntu and clones) are now available, using these options allows live sessions to be persistent over multiple boots, even when used on vfat partition. Again the way it is used does not need change in partition format of the stick, existing data on the stick remains untouched.</p>
<p>Feel free to fork <a href="https://github.com/cyberorg/live-fat-stick">https://github.com/cyberorg/live-fat-stick</a> if you want some more enhancements.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently we implemented <a href="http://www.tallysolutions.com/products/tallyerp9/">Tally ERP 9</a> solution for <a href="http://anticopumps.co.in/">Antico Pumps</a>. That itself is not interesting, the interesting part is they are using <a href="http://ltsp.org/">LTSP</a> Fat client system on <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</a>. They have only one server from which all their client computers boot over the network, the clients do not have hard disk, client OS with all softwares they need including wine(Tally is Windows only software), as well as users&#8217; data resides on the server. Once the client boots all the local resources are used so single low power server can be used to serve many clients.</p>
<p>Tally multiuser is served from a Samba share  on a NAS device, Tally folder is copied to samba share and path to Tally Data is changed so that it points there. Everything they need including printing and export(CSV) works from all clients. Same way Tally can be run on standalone computers. Neither Tally, Wine or openSUSE are modified for getting it working as it would under Windows environment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have come a long way since the first Li-f-e live media based on openSUSE was created, the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e" target="_blank">current release</a> is based on <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:42.1" target="_blank">openSUSE Leap 42.1</a>. <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2015/05/27/indonesia-uses-linux-opensuse-for-pilot-project/" target="_blank">Deployments by Indonesia&#8217;s</a> education system is a shining example of <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Education">openSUSE Education</a> project&#8217;s accomplishment.</p>
<p>The openSUSE project has stopped producing live medias for Leap and also live-installer is dropped from live medias created for the Tumbleweed distribution. As Li-f-e is primarily a live distribution we would not be able to create any more medias without live-installer. So unless this situation changes we may not have Li-f-e based on Leap 42.2.</p>
<p>In the meantime I&#8217;ve had a look at <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> to create Li-f-e based on the latest LTS release of <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/" target="_blank">Ubuntu-Mate</a>, check it out <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberorg-home/files/Li-f-e/" target="_blank">here</a>. Software selection available is kept identical to the Li-f-e based on openSUSE, however there is always a room for improvement, suggestions to enhance it are always welcome.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some time back I wrote a patch to KIWI that allows running openSUSE live entirely from RAM(tmpfs).<br />
<span id="more-11671"></span></p>
<p>How to use it?<br />
Pass &#8220;toram&#8221; parameter at the boot menu. Try it on <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">Li-f-e</a>.</p>
<p>Benefits:<br />
Running the OS from RAM make it lot more responsive than running from DVD or USB device, for example it is most useful for running a demo computer where many users try lot of applications installed in the live system. USB or the DVD can be ejected once the OS is loaded. It can be used to load OS to RAM directly from iso in a virtual machine as well.</p>
<p>Caveat:<br />
Needs enough RAM to copy the entire iso to RAM and then some spare to operate the OS, Li-f-e for instance would need minimum 5G RAM available. It also takes a bit longer to boot as the entire image is copied to RAM.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier tool <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2012/09/13/live-fat-stick/">live-fat-stick</a> uses syslinux to create multiboot USB stick/hdd on a vfat parition without having to format the stick preserving existing data and copying whole ISO so the same stick can serve as demo as well as to copy ISOs for distributing. However the disadvantages are all of them that comes from using vfat.</p>
<p>Grub2 has come a long way and almost all major distributions now support booting from the iso image via loopback. So here is <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/live-grub-stick">live-grub-stick</a> script that uses grub in place of syslinux bringing in all the advantages of using grub2.</p>
<p>Currently live images of openSUSE, Ubuntu, Fedora and all their clones are supported. Go ahead and <a href="https://github.com/cyberorg/live-fat-stick">fork it</a> if you would like to add support for your distribution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best Linux distribution for education got a whole lot better, your <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">Li-f-e(Linux for Education)</a> takes a &#8220;<a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2015/11/04/opensuse-leap-42-1-becomes-first-hybrid-distribution/">Leap</a>&#8221; to 42.1. <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Education">openSUSE Education</a> community is proud to present this latest edition based on <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:42.1">openSUSE 42.1</a> with all the features, updates and bug fixes available on it till date. This effectively makes it the only enterprise grade long term supported(LTS) distribution for Education.</p>
<p>As with previous releases <a href="http://download.opensuse-education.org/~cyberorg/opensuse-edu-life-4211-packages.txt">we have bundled a ton of softwares</a> on this <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick">live DVD/USB</a> specially packaged for education, along with the Plasma, GNOME and Mate Desktop Environments, full multimedia experience is also provided out of the box thanks to the Packman repositories. Only x86_64 architecture is supported, if you have a lot of machines that only support x86 then read on to find out how you can extend their Li-f-e.<br />
<span id="more-11596"></span></p>
<p>You can of course very <a href="http://cyberorg.github.io/kiwi-ltsp-howto/">easily turn Li-f-e to full-fledged LTSP server</a> to PXE boot machines in your local network. Booting both i686 and x86_64 architectures is supported. In case you need to PXE boot machines below i686 then you would have to <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/kiwi-ltsp-tinycore-tc">install this package</a>.</p>
<p>Happy holidays!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following up from my earlier post about <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2014/12/16/ltsp-client-goes-banana-pi/">openSUSE LTSP on Banana Pi</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/102091635847832058268">Nora Lee</a> from the manufacturer of the board got in touch with me and sent me a couple of their new boards- <a href="http://www.bananapi.com/index.php/component/content/article?layout=edit&amp;id=73">Banana Pi M2,</a> runs on A31s quad-core CPU and has 1G RAM, powerful enough to run openSUSE Tumbleweed with Xfce Desktop.</p>
<p>Here is how you can get openSUSE running on Banana Pi M2.</p>
<p>* <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cyberorg-home/files/opensuse-arm/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.tar.xz/download">Download the image</a></p>
<p>* Extract the archive to get openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.img</p>
<p>* Dump openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.img on to a SD card<br />
(dd if=/path/to/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-Bpi-M2-Xfce.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M; sync #replace /dev/sdX with your actual SD card device)</p>
<p>*  In case you have a bigger SD card, use yast2 disk(partitioner) to &#8220;expand&#8221; the second partition. You can use yast’s package manager to install more software. The default password for root is <strong>linux</strong>, you may want to change that first thing after booting.</p>
<p>I am unable to get sound on this hardware, probably <a href="https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-Mainline-bsp">their kernel</a> is missing sound related modules, if you figure out how to get sound working drop me a line so I can include it in next release.Everything else(wifi, hdmi out, USB ports etc) works well enough.</p>
