				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, i know that i haven&#8217;t be so active in the last months here in lizards or the OWN but that doesn&#8217;t mean that i stop my ambassador work, and here is a small story about what i do to integrate the spread of the openSUSE word in my work.</p>
<p>After a really bad month for the economic point of view, i had to refocus all the goals of my company to jump out the hole where i fall thanks to the changes in the economy of my country (Venezuela), so i came out with the idea of give on-line courses about system security, hacking, pen-testing and that kind of stuff, including the usual Web Dev, Sys Admin courses.</p>
<p>I give a lot of conferences of Hacking and System Security around this year in various events, and taking advantage of that give some publicity to the courses, but of course including something: Our Beloved Geeko. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="&#x1f600;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>In the courses I teach using openSUSE, and have turned a lot of people that doesn&#8217;t even had a clue of what its linux, to be a totally Geeko Lovers, to the point that they speak about &#8220;The green side of the force&#8221;.</p>
<p>In all my conferences always appear the words: &#8220;openSUSE its the best option for newbies and advanced users&#8221;, &#8220;You wanna try Linux, well the best option i can give its openSUSE&#8221;, I am a proudly member/ambassador of the openSUSE Community&#8221;.</p>
<p>Subliminal, directly, any way i just point people to use and love the Geeko!</p>
<p>I hope to be more active around here in the next weeks when all the events and congress are done.</p>
<p>Cheers people! There are always some ways to Spread the word of the Geeko!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometime ago I had a little problem with Zypper at the time of adding some packages. The same problem extended to YaST and well, the end of the world.</p>
<p>Possibly there was a integrity problem between the updater and the database RPM, or whatever, the true thing is that the error goes like:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tamaño total a descargar: 174,1 MiB. Después de la operación se utilizarán 565,0 KiB adicionales.<br />

<p>If you have some error like this one, the solution its extremely simple, just run in the command line interface:</p>
<pre>sudo rpm --rebuilddb &amp;&amp; sudo zypper clean -a &amp;&amp; sudo zypper ref</pre>
<p>This will rebuild the RPM database and then refresh the repos. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, continuing with my <a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/2010/08/01/somethings-to-do-after-an-opensuse-installation/">last post</a> about things to do after an openSUSE installation, now its the time for &#8220;Adding Games&#8221;, but first, some clarifications about two things:</p>
<p><strong>One</strong>: You can add Codecs and other stuff with a 1-click-package, avoiding to use Zypper, I just expose the zypper method because I think its a bit more short :-P, but that its just matter of taste. So, if you are running openSUSE 11.3 with KDE use <a href="http://opensuse-community.org/codecs-kde.ymp">this ymp</a>, and if you are using GNOME <a href="http://opensuse-community.org/codecs-gnome.ymp">use this other</a>. If you are on a older version of openSUSE, just go to <a href="http://opensuse-community.org/Restricted_Formats">this page</a> and select your version.</p>
<p><strong>Two</strong>: The broadcom-wl package its on Packman, so you have to add that repo (Via YaST -&gt; Repositories), before you can install that package.</p>
<p>After this, now we can keep going.</p>
<p><strong>Adding Games</strong></p>
<p>So, the question: &#8220;¿Why a lot of games that are popular in the FOSS community aren&#8217;t by default in openSUSE?&#8221; For example, OpenArena, Battle for Wesnoth, aTanks, BlobWars, Crack Attack, LBreakout2, Torcs, SuperTux,&#8230; Well, because those games are on its own repo called &#8220;Games&#8221;.</p>
<p>To enable this repo just go to: “YaST -&gt; Software Repositories”, then will show you the repos management window, you push “Add”, and then select “Specifying URL”, then in the name &#8220;Games&#8221;, and the URL &#8220;<strong>http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/games/openSUSE_11.3/</strong>&#8220;, “Next”, if he ask you something you say yes (import gpg signature and stuff), then you get back to the main window and then you hit “Accept”.</p>
<p>In the URL, change the number of the version if needed, and done&#8230; You have now a LOT of games available via YaST <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="&#x1f600;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/suse.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4745" /> Every time that I make a new openSUSE installation, I always add some additional stuff to get an even better user experience, that&#8217;s why I enumerate here the things that i suggest to you do after a successfully openSUSE installation.</p>
<p>Read well, read again, so you will not be lost. All the commands that I show here between double quotes (“) for the time of the execution will go without the quotes and with the text in bold just like that.</p>
<p><strong>Wireless cards suppport</strong></p>
<p>Although in the Linux kernel there are a lot of wireless cards supported by default, there are others &#8220;rare&#8221; that need a little more of work, so the first thing that you must do is execute this in a command line interface: &#8220;<strong>/sbin/lspci</strong>&#8220;, to get the list of your devices and then look for a line like this: </p>
<blockquote><p>04:01.0 Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR2413 802.11bg NIC (rev 01)</p></blockquote>
<p>In my local desktop i have an Atheros Wireless Card that the kernel detected and put working by default. The same can happen with Intel an another ones around. If your luck is to have an Broadcom, like BCM43xx (the xx could be any number), you will need to plug your machine into a LAN, and then execute &#8220;<strong>su -c ‘install_bcm43xx_firmware’ </strong>&#8220;, this will ask you for your root password (normally its the same that your user password), and then this will going to install some files (the firmware) to get the working the B43 module. After the installation, just reboot your machine, now it should work. If not, you have some of those really weird Broadcom, so you must install the proprietary controller with: “<strong>sudo zypper in broadcom-wl</strong>“.</p>
<p><strong>Audio and Video Codecs</strong></p>
<p>Of course that you can play those divx, xvid and wmv video files, and your mp3 files with full support, all you must do its go to: &#8220;YaST -&gt; Software Repositories&#8221;, then will show you the repos management window, you push &#8220;Add&#8221;, and then select &#8220;Community Repositories&#8221;, &#8220;Next&#8221;, select the &#8220;Packman Repositories&#8221;, &#8220;Next&#8221;, if he ask you something you say yes (import gpg signature and stuff), then you get back to the main window and then you hit &#8220;Accept&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then you execute in the command line:  &#8220;<strong>zypper in libxine1 libxine1-codecs win32codecs</strong>&#8220;, and done. If he ask something about &#8220;providers change&#8221; you say yes.</p>
<p><strong>Next to come</strong>: Adding games.</p>

<p>This time, i wanna take time to thank <a href="http://tatica.org" target="_blank">Maria &#8220;tatica&#8221; Leandro</a>, the national coordinator of the event, for all the invaluable help and dedication that she put to get our FLISOL a really great live experience.</p>
<p>She is a famous Fedora Ambassador in the region, that got the sponsorship from Novell for all the sites, and even to get spread the openSUSE word in other post-flisol events. I would  like help her in getting the material, but this happens in a time that i was bloated of work. So, I hope she gets her beatification from her invaluable help in the event.</p>

<p>A lot of happy faces after they see YaST and how easy somethings are.</p>
<p>Of course, the main character was our beloved &#8220;Gecko&#8221;, who  captivated eyes, picking fights, tears and others because they all  wanted a bit of it! xD</p>

<p>My premise was  simple, free your machine and win a gecko or a DVD, or a t-shirt. Finally, I got one of my goals,  give a push to <a href="http://bit.ly/GoSVe" target="_blank">GoSVe </a>and open  people&#8217;s eyes to more options, as is  openSUSE.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Encrypt a file can be useful when we want  to keep sensitive information but do not trust the site is being  stored.</p>
<p>GnuPG  allows to quickly and easily create encrypted files without the use of  public keys or complicated procedures, just run the following at a Linux  terminal:</p>
<p><strong>$ gpg -c test.txt _<br />
Enter  Password:<br />
Repeat Password:<br />
$ _<br />
</strong><br />
After  you have run the command gpg -c, this will leave intact the original file  and create another file called &#8220;test.gpg&#8221; in the same directory. This second file is the place where you want to prune  without fear that information may be disclosed. You can then  proceed to remove the original if needed.</p>
<p>To retrieve the contents of the file, perform the following  process on the encrypted file:</p>
<p><strong>$ gpg  test.gpg _<br />
Enter  Password:<br />
Repeat Password:<br />
$ _</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>GnuPG will automatically detect that it is an  encrypted file, and request the key that first used.</p>
<p>Hope its useful <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
