		<description><![CDATA[Just to clarify, the latest changes about the proposal and using multiple values will only affect SUSE Manager, the SUSE’s purpose-specific distribution to manage software-defined infrastructures.

For openSUSE everything will keep working as expected, using only one disk by default and with the already known Guided Setup (for the time being, at least).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some very interesting changes.
I&#039;ll be looking forward to seeing how those change in the disk layouts are implemented, it sounds like there will be at least two base proposals (multi-disk preferred over single disk) which could be helpful if BTRFS volumes continue to be recommended everywhere. Am hoping though that they&#039;can be customized which is how the current &quot;Guided setup&quot; works... ie you should be able to choose the base layout pattern to start and then modify as desired.

Even so, there are so many reasons one can pick and choose or ignore for deploying separate volumes (or partitioning) I wonder if it&#039;s really possible to make a suggestion that won&#039;t often be heavily modified.

And then, I&#039;m thinking about the Snapper consequences... including and excluding directories and volumes because of why those volumes are created in the first place...

It all becomes so complex.
The current openSUSE single disk layout proposal vastly simplifies how each application is installed and the location of application data.

But still looking forward to what is being proposed...]]></description>
