		<description><![CDATA[It is about source packages. Some people think of those as .src.rpm files, but in OBS they are tracked as their components, e.g.:
https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/aubio

and that is now mapped to
https://github.com/bmwiedemann/openSUSE/tree/master/packages/a/aubio

&#039;binaries&#039; was a bit misleading in what I wrote - the source tarball got replaced by a symlink.
Does not make much sense to track those in git because diff and deltas do not work on them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting but only based on a quick and superficial glance at your repository, it&#039;s hard to grasp exactly what I&#039;m looking at... I see plenty of metadata but no packages (which might be the point, but 1Gig&#039;s worth?!). Maybe your reference to use of symlinks to binaries is what you meant by the missing packages?

For those of us who were not party to the discussion which spurred your experiment, a short summary might have been nice, and possibly include the reason for why searching the git mirror is so much faster.

Yhc, it looks like a cool project.]]></description>
