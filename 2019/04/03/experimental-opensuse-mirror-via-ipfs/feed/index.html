		<description><![CDATA[There are hickups now and then. One is that the ipfs daemon leaks memory and has to be restarted now and then.

The other seems to be that freshly added files are only announced to the world within the day.

The workaround for that is to run
#!/bin/sh
ipfs swarm connect /ip4/176.9.1.211/tcp/34001/ipfs/QmT7bZwZ3gpBMswUBjtpFhPM42ErFapAPiQHM2ELu3deqs

That sort of makes the DHT-based auto-discovery superfluous, but at least it works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I tried the native ipns publishing first, but found that resolving it, always took 60 seconds and was only cached for another minute or so.
You can try it with /ipns/opensuse2.zq1.de./

Sometimes it would not work at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, I see what&#039;s happening. It&#039;s not that IPFS is a P-P network but that you&#039;re implementing a locally running proxy server to transform the network connections, and using the /ipns/ prefix to designate an ipfs name lookup.

OK, I&#039;ll take a look at this soon! Looks interesting! I think I remember when this was first mentioned years ago in an openSUSE Technical Forums post, and there was a short discussion of its benefits and possible drawbacks at the time. Will be interested in seeing how it&#039;s progressed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think your repo URI shouldn&#039;t be localhost (127.0.0.1)...
:)

That&#039;s something to keep in mind even when developing and testing, the localhost interface is completely different than the LAN interface which in some cases can be a drastic difference (eg configuring a website&#039;s address). And, to be even more sure it&#039;s a good idea to publicly deploy before even starting to write the final draft so you&#039;re working off a final, Production configuration.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great! I&#039;ll give it a try.

Suggestion: instead of putting &quot;/ipfs/&quot; link in DNS and updating it with script, you can put once an &quot;/ipns/&quot; link, that references an &quot;/ipfs/&quot; link and can be updated.
