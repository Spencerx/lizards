		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for posting about the problem, your steps to analyze, your conclusion and your solution.

Still,
Your description and solution looks suspiciously like a common required setting when deploying high capacity Java apps in general which would have nothing to do with systemd(maybe you&#039;re only applying the new configuration in a Unit file vs the native app configuration file?)... It&#039;s fairly well known that in high capacity Java apps that the default number of supported threads is inadequate, and needs to be increased.

This is something that has to be set in all Java apps including very large deployments of Logstash if you&#039;re running Elastic, various other Java server apps.]]></description>
