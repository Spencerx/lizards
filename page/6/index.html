            <p>Five weeks without blogging is certainly a quite an hiatus for the YaST Team. But fear no more, we are back! This is the first time in quite a while in which our post is not titled &#8220;Highlights of YaST Development Sprint&#8221; and there are good reasons for that.</p>
<h3>Adapting the YaST Team Structure the Agile Way</h3>
<p>Now that openSUSE Leap 15.0 is out and SUSE Enterprise Linux 15 is ready to be shipped, we felt it was time to rethink our activities. For the duration of the storage-ng development, we had split the YaST team into two sub-teams: Team S for <strong>S</strong>torage and Team R for the <strong>R</strong>est. But now new challenges await us; there are some things that were pushed aside because getting storage-ng into an acceptable state had top priority.</p>
<p>We decided we&#8217;d try an approach that other development teams in SUSE have already been using successfully: split up the YaST team into &#8220;squads&#8221; of 3-5 people each for the duration of a couple of sprints. Each squad is centered around a big topic that needs to be addressed. There is no long-term fixed assignment of anyone to any squad; the idea is to shuffle people and thus know-how around as needed, of course taking each developer&#8217;s interests into account. So the squads and the topics will change every few weeks.</p>
<p>Is this the pure spirit of Scrum and the agile bible? We don&#8217;t know. And we don&#8217;t care. The agile spirit is to adapt your work based on what makes sense in every moment. We work the agile way, so the way of working also has to be agile.</p>
<p>The next sprint&#8217;s report will contain more information about the first set of squads and the results they are delivering. But meanwhile we have done much more than just reorganizing our forces. While the sprint-based work was suspended (thus the blog title not containing the word &#8220;sprint&#8221;), the YaST team still managed to put out of the door quite some features, improvements and bug fixes targeting mainly Tumbleweed.</p>
<h3>Expert Partitioner: Moving Partitions</h3>
<p>After quite some effort, the YaST team has completely rewritten the Expert Partitioner from scratch using the new storage stack (a.k.a. storage-ng). And although this new Expert Partitioner already offers practically all the same features than the old one, some last options are still coming. One them in the button for moving partitions, which saves us of a lot unnecessary work in many cases. For example, imagine you are installing openSUSE Tumbleweed and the installer automatically proposes you to create a partition for root and, just following it, a second partition for home. In case you don&#8217;t like the default proposed sizes (e.g. because you want a bigger root), you have to use the Expert Partitioner to fix the situation. You have to completely remove the home partition, resize root for enlarging it and then create home again with the same options than before.</p>
<p>Now, with the &#8220;Move&#8221; button, this kind of modifications are much easier. For that example, you can accomplish exactly the same by simply resizing home (without deleting it completely) and moving the resized home closer to the end of the disk (by using Move button). After moving the home partition, you have enough free space for enlarging the root partition. In the following screenshot you can see this dialog for moving partitions.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/moving1.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/moving1-300x225.png" alt="Moving partitions" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13253" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/moving1-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/moving1-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/moving1.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>One important thing to take into account is that the movement of partitions is only possible for new partitions, that is, it is not possible to move partitions that already exist on disk.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nomoving.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nomoving-300x225.png" alt="Trying to move an existing partition" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13254" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nomoving-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nomoving-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nomoving.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>YaST Masking Systemd Mount and Swap Units</h3>
<p>And speaking about the Partitioner and its relationship with the rest of the system, the transition from SysVinit to Systemd changed the behavior of (open)SUSE concerning mounting devices. Systemd generates mount units for various file systems, e.g. those listed in <code>/etc/fstab</code>. The result is that Systemd may automatically mount any file system, even if that file system has been manually unmounted before. This can be problematic when the user needs the file system to be unmounted for certain operations, like resizing or unplugging.</p>
<p>Thus, now the Partitioner uses a new mechanism to prevent that to happen during its execution. Starting with version 4.0.194, the <code>yast2-storage-ng</code> package includes and uses the script <code>/usr/lib/YaST2/bin/mask-systemd-units</code> to mask all mount and swap units one by one. The script might also be useful for direct use of system administrators. So&#8230; profit!</p>
<h3>Showing Logs the Systemd Way</h3>
<p>And since we speak about how Systemd has changed the way the overall system works, it&#8217;s also worth noticing how more and more services has been adopting the Systemd journal for its logging purposes.</p>
<p>Some of the existing YaST modules to configure a given service include a button to show the logs of such service. In the past, they used to display the content of <code>/var/log/messages</code> with some basic filtering to ensure only the information relative to the service (e.g. <code>tftp</code>) was shown. But that didn&#8217;t work out of the box for services already using the Systemd journal, and we had gotten quite some bug reports about it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the solution is really at our fingertips. You surely know by now that there is a YaST module for viewing the  journal content with powerful queries for filtering, searching and so so on.  The obvious solution is to use that YaST journal module also within other YaST modules, in order to show domain specific logs.</p>
<p>So far we adapted the YaST tftp module, but it will be easy to fix also other places that use the old approach that no longer works. And this is how it looks when you click the &#8220;Show Logs&#8221; button in the YaST module to configure tftp.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tftp-journal-entries.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tftp-journal-entries-300x201.png" alt="Journal entries for the tftp module" width="300" height="201" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13256" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tftp-journal-entries-300x201.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tftp-journal-entries-768x514.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tftp-journal-entries.png 999w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Usability Improvement in the Repositories Manager</h3>
<p>The YaST repositories manager displays the repositories sorted by priority. But some people have a lot of repositories in their system and make no use of the priorities. Since there was not a clear second criteria, the order of the repository list looked quite arbitrary in those cases. Now all the repositories with the same priority are sorted by name, which makes more sense. See how it looked before the improvement.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/repos-before.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/repos-before-300x193.png" alt="List of repositories sorted only by priority" width="300" height="193" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13258" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/repos-before-300x193.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/repos-before-768x494.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/repos-before-1024x659.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/repos-before.png 1345w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>And compare to how it looks now.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/repos-after.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/repos-after-300x192.png" alt="List of repositories sorted by priority and name" width="300" height="192" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13259" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/repos-after-300x192.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/repos-after-768x491.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/repos-after-1024x655.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/repos-after.png 1346w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Handling Inconsistent Boot Methods During Upgrade</h3>
<p>We got a rather interesting amount of bug reports for openSUSE Leap 15.0 about collisions between the <code>grub2</code> and <code>grub2-efi</code> bootloaders during the upgrade process. The root cause was that the installation medium used a different booting mode than the installed system being upgraded. For example, the installed system uses EFI boot but the upgrade is executed from a DVD booted via legacy mode (i.e. disabling EFI). In that case, the kernel running from the DVD does not expose some devices that are needed to write to the EFI boot manager. Moreover, it causes troubles to the updater itself, which does not expect this situation.</p>
<p>Looking at the majority of the bug reports, it is obvious that in most cases it happens by accident rather than the user consciously trying to mix both boot modes. So to improve the user experience we added a warning that will be displayed when this situation is detected, before starting the upgrade. That gives the user the possibility to fix the problem or to continue if the situation is really intentional.</p>
<p>Below you can see how it looks, both in graphical and text mode, in a patched openSUSE Leap 15.0 installation media, since the feature was developed too late to be included in the official installation images.</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s Next? Hack Week!</h3>
<p>As commented at the beginning of the post, we have restarted the sprint-based work, although with a little twist to try out the squads approach. But before we come back to you to show the results of the first squad-based sprint, we have something else to do &#8211; <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/">Hack Week 17!</a>.</p>
<p>Again it&#8217;s the time of the year for all SUSE Engineers (and any Open Source enthusiast willing to join) to innovate and learn new stuff. So please forgive us if we go too deep into playing and we are less responsive next week. See you again soon!</p>

            <p>Three weeks from our last update on this blog. Time flies when you are busy! As you know, openSUSE Leap 15.0 was released in the meantime, which also means the active development of SLE15 is coming to an end&#8230; so time to look a little bit further into the future.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we had a face-to-face workshop with the whole YaST Team at the beautiful city of Prague during several days right before joining the <a href="https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC18">openSUSE Conference 2018</a>.</p>
<p>But we have done much more in three weeks than attending workshops and conferences. Apart from last-minute fixes, here you have a list of some interesting changes we have done in YaST in this period. Take into account that some of these changes didn&#8217;t make it into Leap 15.0, although all will be available in SLES15 and are probably already integrated into openSUSE Tumbleweed.</p>
<h3>Fine tuning installer behavior in small disks</h3>
<p>As you may know, the default installation of SLE and both openSUSE distribution enables Btrfs snapshots in the root partition alongside separate partitions for <code>/home</code> and swap. That means a default installation needs quite some space. In SLE12 and openSUSE Leap 42.X, if such disk space was not there the installer silently tries to disable the separate <code>/home</code> and even the snapshots in order to be able to create an initial proposal.</p>
<p>That behavior has become configurable for each product and role with Storage-ng and during the last sprint there was some controversy about what the configuration should be, both for openSUSE and the SLE family. It may look like a minor problem, but it becomes very relevant in virtualization environment (where virtual disks smaller than 10 GiB are not uncommon) or certain architectures with special storage devices like s390 and ARM.</p>
<p>The final decision was to never disable snapshots automatically in the case of openSUSE, so the user will be forced to manually go through the Guided Setup and explicitly disable snapshots to install in a small disk. In the SLE case, it was decided to keep the traditional behavior (automatically disabling snapshots if really needed) but making the situation more visible by adding a previous sentence to explain how the initial proposal was calculated.</p>
<p>So the installation in a normal disk would look like this.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/default.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/default-300x197.png" alt="Default initial partitioning proposal" width="300" height="197" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13203" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/default-300x197.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/default.png 632w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>While the installation in a very small disk displays some information similar to the following screen (the wording was slightly improved after taking the screenshots).</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/minimal.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/minimal-300x192.png" alt="Adjusted initial partitioning proposal" width="300" height="192" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13204" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/minimal-300x192.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/minimal.png 599w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The explanatory text preceding the list of actions will be available in all products based on SLE15, but will not be there for Leap 15.0, since the modification to the installer was not ready on time for the deadline and, moreover, would have been impossible to get the translations on time.</p>
<p>By the way, if you are interested in a more in-depth explanation on how the partitioning proposal adapts to all kind of situations like small disks and other scenarios, don&#8217;t hesitate to check Iván&#8217;s presentation at openSUSE Conference 2018 detailing its internals.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_0VKUjFAIwo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>More parameter passing for s390</h3>
<p>And talking about uncommon scenarios and the s390 architecture, you may remember that in the latest sprint we improved the handling of the persistent network device names kernel parameter for such systems. Shortly after, we found out a similar improvement was needed also for the FIPS parameter.</p>
<p>FIPS is a military encryption standard in USA. If the installation is started using the corresponding parameter, YaST will enforce strong encryption and will install an specific FIPS pattern. Moreover, after the recent fix, a system installed in hardened mode s390 will continue operating in this mode after the installation.</p>
<h3>Fun with MD RAIDs</h3>
<p>As SLE15 comes closer, future users start testing the system with more exotic and complex hardware setups. Same applies to openSUSE Leap 15.0 right after the official release. As a result of all that testing, we found several scenarios in which Storage-ng got confused about MD RAIDs defined by some specific hardware or manually by the user before starting the installation.</p>
<p>By default, the old storage didn&#8217;t handle partitions within software RAIDs and it didn&#8217;t handle software RAIDs directly on top of full disks (with no partitions in the physical disks). For the first version of Storage-ng present in Leap 15.0 and SLE15, we tried to implement the same behavior with the intention to rethink the whole thing and open new possibilities in the close future. Check more about the present and future of Storage-ng in Ancor&#8217;s talk at openSUSE Conference 2018.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/etsT3xP52Zs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Unfortunately, while trying to replicate the old storage behavior with software-defined MD RAIDs, we overlooked some heuristic that was hidden in the old implementation to recognize some special setups in which a given RAID device currently detected as regular software-defined RAIDs should be treated like hardware RAIDs. That&#8217;s the case of Software RAID Virtual Disks defined on a S130/S140 controller on DellEMC PowerEdge Servers through the BIOS Interface. We also found that some users used to produce a similar situation by manually creating software MD RAIDs and creating partitions within them before starting the installation.</p>
<p>With the preparation of SLE15 already in the final stages and with openSUSE Leap 15 already out, it was too late to introduce drastic changes in how MD RAIDs are detected and used.  To mitigate the problem while limiting the potential breakage, we reintroduced an ancient installer parameter. Now, when we run the installer using <code>LIBSTORAGE_MDPART=1</code>, all existing software-defined RAIDs will be considered as BIOS RAIDs.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/raid.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/raid-300x225.png" alt="Using LIBSTORAGE_MDPART" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13211" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/raid-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/raid-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/raid.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The new parameter is not available in Leap 15.0 (we added it too late) and will hopefully not be necessary anymore in future versions of SLE and openSUSE, since the short term plan is to redesign everything about how MD RAIDs are handled during installation.</p>
<h3>And even more fun with MD RAIDs</h3>
<p>Another example of RAID that looks like defined by software but is indeed assembled by BIOS is the Intel RSTe technology. In this case, the usage of <code>LIBSTORAGE_MDPART</code> is not needed, but still we found the bootloader installation to be broken because YaST was once again getting confused by the mixed RAID setup.</p>
<p>Fortunately it was possible to fix the issue and verify the solution in only two days, despite the YaST Team not having direct access to the hardware, thanks to the outstanding help of the user reporting the bug. Connecting users and developers directly always produces great results&#8230; and that&#8217;s one of the reasons open source rocks so much!</p>
<h3>Improved error reporting for wrong bootloader in AutoYaST</h3>
<p>That was not the only improvement in the bootloader handling done during this sprint. We also invested some time improving the user experience in AutoYAST, since the error message displayed when using an EFI variant not supported in the system architecture was far from being useful or even informative.</p>
<p>So alongside a more clear message, AutoYaST will now list all the possible values supported on the given architecture to better guide the user.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bootloader.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bootloader-300x227.png" alt="More precise bootloader error in AutoYaST" width="300" height="227" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13216" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bootloader-300x227.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bootloader-768x582.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bootloader-1024x776.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bootloader.png 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Setting the default subvolume name in AutoYaST</h3>
<p>AutoYaST also received improvements in other areas, like making use of the new possibilities offered by Storage-ng. The new storage layer allows the user to set different default subvolumes (or none at all) for every Btrfs file system. As shown in the example below, a prefix name can be specified for each partition using the <code>subvolumes_prefix</code>.</p>
<pre>
&lt;partition&gt;
  &lt;mount&gt;/&lt;/mount&gt;
  &lt;filesystem config:type="symbol"&gt;btrfs&lt;/filesystem&gt;
  &lt;size&gt;max&lt;/size&gt;
  &lt;subvolumes_prefix&gt;@&lt;/subvolumes_prefix&gt;
&lt;/partition&gt;
</pre>
<p>To omit the subvolume prefix, set the <code>subvolumes_prefix</code> tag:</p>
<pre>
&lt;partition&gt;
  &lt;mount&gt;/&lt;/mount&gt;
  &lt;filesystem config:type="symbol"&gt;btrfs&lt;/filesystem&gt;
  &lt;size&gt;max&lt;/size&gt;
  &lt;subvolumes_prefix&gt;&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;&lt;/subvolumes_prefix&gt;
&lt;/partition&gt;
</pre>
<p>As a consequence of the new behaviour, the old <code>btrfs_set_default_subvolume_name</code> tag is not needed and, therefore, it is not supported in Leap 15.0 and SLE15.</p>
<h3>Skipping Btrfs subvolume creation</h3>
<p>And more changes in AutoYaST that arrived just in time for SLE15 and openSUSE Leap 15.0. Recently, we have introduced a new flag in AutoYaST partition sections to skip the creation of Btrfs subvolumes because, due to a known limitation of our XML parser, it is not possible to specify an empty list.</p>
<p>So from now on, setting <code>create_subvolumes</code> to <code>false</code> will prevent AutoYaST from creating any Btrfs subvolumes in a given partition.</p>
<pre>
&lt;partition&gt;
  &lt;mount&gt;/&lt;/mount&gt;
  &lt;filesystem config:type="symbol"&gt;btrfs&lt;/filesystem&gt;
  &lt;size&gt;max&lt;/size&gt;
  &lt;create_subvolumes config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/create_subvolumes&gt;
&lt;/partition&gt;
</pre>
<h3>Keep it rolling!</h3>
<p>As usual, the content of this post is just a small part of everything we did during the sprint. There were also many other fixes and improvements, from auto-repairing wrong partition tables (with different sizes than the underlying disk) during installation to better interaction with other components like udisk or mdadm auto-assembling and many other things in between.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s time to go back to work and start implementing all the new ideas that emerged from the YaST Team Workshop and the openSUSE Conference. See you in the next report!</p>

            <p>LEAP/SLE 15 is getting more stable and closer to be released, but to keep this process flowing, our team of bug killers is having a lot of work to do!</p>
<p>This last sprint we had several fixes for really special scenarios. The kind of problems that you can find once <del>most of</del> things are working fine! So let&#8217;s take a look at some of these cases and how we&#8217;re working to stabilize this upcoming release.</p>
<h2>Keep predictable network devices settings on S390x</h2>
<p>A not well-known feature in YaST is that many specific boot parameters for installation are also used on the target system. However, this approach has one exception: the S390 mainframe. In this case, many installation specific parameters should not go to the target system and, therefore, we ignore all installation parameter for this system.<br />
In the last sprint, we worked on a bug, which reported that at least systemd predictable names for network devices should be also used for S390 systems, otherwise the configuration done during the installation won&#8217;t be valid in a running system as network names will differ. So, from SLE15 we start to keep the settings of predictable network names for S390 systems.</p>
<h2>Fun with console configuration of GRUB2</h2>
<p>Another report that helped us to learn about other not well-known features was the one reporting that bootloader module does not support multiple console outputs of GRUB2. After digging into some code, we found out that YaST bootloader takes only native terminal, gfxterm or serial console in consideration, but not a mix of them.<br />
Once we looked at the manual of GRUB2, we learned that it supports some funny outputs such as morse code, PC beeper or simple data protocol using system speaker. Of course, YaST2 bootloader does not support all these options and when it gets one of them, it is treated as an unexpected value and bootloader fails.</p>
<p>As we are really close to Leap/SLE 15 release, we want to avoid big changes in the system.  So we decided to handle this issue by showing a popup, which informs that the configuration contains an unexpected value and asks if the whole proposed configuration should be proposed again or if YaST should quit and let the user edit it manually.</p>
<p>If you are curious about how it looks like:</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsuported_conf_grub.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsuported_conf_grub-300x192.png" alt="" width="300" height="192" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13194" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsuported_conf_grub-300x192.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsuported_conf_grub-768x493.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsuported_conf_grub-1024x657.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsuported_conf_grub.png 1347w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>For Leap 15.1 / SLE 15 SP1 we plan to extend the values that we support to provide a nicer experience for the user.</p>
<h2>Bootloader configuration during upgrade</h2>
<p>Another reported issue in bootloader was also solved this last sprint. When upgrading from Leap 42/SLE 12 to Leap/SLE 15, if the user clicks on booting on the proposal, the system crashes. The reason is that usually on openSUSE 13.2/SLE 11 it needs to repropose bootloader during the upgrade. This is no longer required for the latest upgrade and, therefore, YaST does not expect that the user will click on it. We would like to remove this option completely, but YaST still support upgrade from SLE11 to SLE15,  so we still need it there. In the end, the solution is to show a popup informing the user that the modification of bootloader is not supported during upgrade.</p>
<p>In short, take a look at the screenshot:</p>

<h2>Fixing kdump on Xen</h2>
<p>We got a report about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kdump_(Linux)">kdump</a> breaking when it is used in Xen. To explain the problem, we need to go back to how we configure a parameter and the reasons we implemented it in this way: In current versions (before this fix) when a user wants to use kdump,  we configure the crashkernel kernel parameter for all targets, for the common kernel, Xen PV0 domain and also Xen guests. This approach worked very well in the past because traditional xenlinux ignores crashkernel for PV0 and just pass it to Xen VMs. However, the current pvops implementation of Xen no longer ignores this parameter and consequently, it results in breaking the Xen virtualization. The solution for this issue was pretty simple: YaST stopped to propose using crashkernel for Xen PV0 and everything works again. This is a perfect example to show how to understand the issue, sometimes, takes much more time than to fix it!</p>
<h2>Improving the upgrade from SLE11/12 to SLE15</h2>
<p>We are still improving the migration from SLE11 or SLE12 to SLE15 and this sprint we were focused on the automated registration upgrade using AutoYaST. If you are not familiar with the autoupgrade feature you can find more details in the <a href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/singlehtml/book_autoyast/book_autoyast.html#CreateProfile.upgrade">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We already supported manual registration upgrade from the old products, but the automated way was still not adapted to the new SUSE Customer Center (SCC) API and it did not work correctly. This sprint we have adapted the registration upgrade code to correctly work in the interactive mode and also in the automatic upgrade.</p>
<p>The code was adapted to skip the user interaction and do everything manually when running in the autoupgrade mode. The only problematic part was how to handle multiple migration targets, which in the interactive upgrade we ask the user to choose one. To have a simple solution we decided to take the first migration, later (SP1) we might allow configuring this as well. But as now there is only one migration possible anyway, this looks like a good enough solution.</p>
<h2>Falling back to the guided proposal</h2>
<p>During this sprint, we were informed that AutoYaST was unable to display a proper error message when no <code>partitioning</code> section was specified and there was not enough disk space. The bug was rather easy to solve, but we wanted to take the opportunity to highlight how AutoYaST works when the <code>partitioning</code> section is missing from the profile.</p>
<p>In the past, AutoYaST implemented its own logic, different from the one used during a normal installation. Fortunately, as part of the adaptation to the new storage layer, AutoYaST relies now on the same code than the regular installation in order to propose a partitioning layout when the <code>partitioning</code> section is not specified. What is more, you can override some values which are defined in the product&#8217;s control file by setting them in the <code>general/storage</code> section from the AutoYaST profile.</p>
<h2>Leap /SLE 15 is closed, but Tumbleweed is still rolling</h2>
<p>We are really close to release Leap/SLE 15 and we are more focused on minimal changes that fix only critical stuff. On the other hand, Tumbleweed users are looking always for the latest and greatest features. In order to satisfy both groups, YaST separated Leap 15.1/SLE 15 and Tumbleweed in two different git branches. In this way, we can easily start adding new features, bug fixes and other improvements for Tumbleweed while we keep SLE15 stabilized. Besides that, there is another planned Service Pack for SLE12, and once we start to work at it, we&#8217;ll also create a new separated branch to include these changes. We also adapted all related infrastructure around the branches, such as CI, docker testing images, among others.</p>
<p>This way, we are able to allow you to enjoy the stable Leap 15 or the latest and hottest Tumbleweed.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re now working on our last sprint before the openSUSE Conference 2018. In two weeks we&#8217;ll come back with the highlights of Sprint 57 and until there we hope that you have already everything planned to enjoy the conference that will occur in Prague this year (we hope that you enjoy the city too). We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing you there!</p>

            <p>Time flies. We are almost in May and the openSUSE Conference &#8217;18 is around the corner. So after booking your flights (if you need to) and your acommodation, you might want to know what happened in the YaST world during the Development Sprint 55th.</p>
<p>The YaST team is currently polishing the upcoming release, introducing some improvements and fixes. There are no breaking changes but still we have a lot of things to blog about.</p>
<h2 id="updating-nfs-version-handling">Updating NFS Version Handling</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, back in 2008 to be precise, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was finally ready, Raúl Castro replaced Fidel as President of Cuba, the TV show Phineas and Ferb was previewed&#8230; and <code>yast2-nfs-client</code> added support to configure NFSv4 mounts. Back then, the proper way of doing that was using &#8220;nfs4&#8221; as type for mounting the NFS share, i.e. writing &#8220;nfs4&#8221; in the <code>vfstype</code> column of the <code>/etc/fstab</code> file. Some time later, NFS4.1 (also known as pNFS) came out, and a new mount option &#8220;minorversion=1&#8221; was added. Very soon it was clear that such solution was not scaling and was not the way to go.</p>
<p>So at some point &#8220;nfs4&#8221; was deprecated as acceptable value for <code>vfstype</code> and &#8220;minorversion&#8221; was ditched in favor of &#8220;nfsvers&#8221;. Since the old deprecated way of doing things was still working, <code>yast2-nfs-client</code> was never updated to reflect this. But starting with the upcoming Leap 15 and SLE 15, some things will change in NFSland (in fact, the change landed in openSUSE Tumbleweed some time ago already). The type &#8220;nfs4&#8221; will be considered identical to &#8220;nfs&#8221; and &#8220;minorversion&#8221; will be completely ignored, so your old NFS mounts may not work as you expect them to do it. Time to refresh <code>yast2-nfs-client</code>!</p>
<p>During this sprint, <code>yast2-nfs-client</code> was not only fixed internally to produce valid entries in <code>/etc/fstab</code>, it also got a slightly revamped form to create and edit NFS mounts that should be less confusing than the old one and also more explanatory about how NFS versioning really works when defining a mount.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yast2-nfs-client-nfsv4.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yast2-nfs-client-nfsv4-300x154.png" alt="NFS version selection" width="300" height="154" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13140" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yast2-nfs-client-nfsv4-300x154.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yast2-nfs-client-nfsv4.png 560w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>To ensure our users don&#8217;t get fooled by old entries that seems to be enforcing a particular NFS version (because they use &#8220;nfs4&#8221; as mount type, for example), but are in fact not doing it due to the new behavior in SLE 15 and openSUSE 15, <code>yast2-nfs-client</code> is now able to detect such circumstance, mark such entries in the list and offer a safe migration path to users.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yast2-nfs-client-nfs4-warning.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yast2-nfs-client-nfs4-warning-300x207.png" alt="nfs4 warning" width="300" height="207" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13142" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yast2-nfs-client-nfs4-warning-300x207.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yast2-nfs-client-nfs4-warning-768x529.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yast2-nfs-client-nfs4-warning.png 878w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>As you can infer from the screenshot above, all these improvements are available when <code>yast2-nfs-client</code> runs standalone, as well as when it runs embedded within the YaST Partitioner. Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="fixing-broken-translations">Fixing Broken Translations</h2>
<p>Recently we got some bug reports about YaST crashing at some points when running in some specific locales. It turned out that the problem was caused by broken translations.</p>
<p>A lot of translated texts contain placeholders like <code>%s</code>, <code>%{text}</code> or <code>%1</code>. These tags are replaced by the real values by YaST. But that requires that the translated text contains the same tags. If they are missing the value will not be included and, what is even worst, if they are invalid the Ruby interpreter throws an exception which means YaST aborts making our users unhappy. And that&#8217;s really bad, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Ruby gettext does not support format tags and the GNU gettext does not support Ruby at all. As a quick solution we wrote a script which checks whether all tags are included in the translated text and reports broken translations.</p>
<p>The script found about 160 broken translations. The most common problems were usually just typos (<code>s%</code> instead of <code>%s</code>, <code>{%foo}</code> instead of <code>%{foo}</code>, or extra space in <code>%␣1</code>). But some cases were not that trivial. Translators by mistake also used the Unicode <code>٪</code> instead of the ASCII <code>%</code> or even translated the tags, which must stay untouched (<code>%{مساعدة}</code>).</p>
<p>Some translations were obviously wrong or even contained the original English texts &#8211; we removed them. In some cases the tags were wrong but we were not sure whether the whole translation is valid. In that case instead of fixing the tags we removed the translated text completely. It is better to ask the translators for translating again than have a completely invalid translation.</p>
<p>In the future we plan to improve these checks, so the tags are properly handled by Ruby and/or GNU gettext directly and we do not need a separate script for that.</p>
<h2 id="installing-over-vnc-using-browser">Installing Over VNC Using the Browser</h2>
<p>You are surely accustomed to remote administration using SSH. And, as you may know, the (open)SUSE installation can be done over SSH too. But, additionally, YaST also have support for installing over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing" rel="nofollow">VNC</a>.</p>
<p>When using VNC for installation, you can choose between using a native VNC viewer or a web browser based one. The cool thing about the second option, is that you can follow the installation just pointing your browser to <code>http://IP-ADDRESS:5801</code>.</p>
<p>Until now, YaST was using a Java applet based implementation, which is no longer supported in browsers. But during this sprint, we have completed the switch to a JavaScript based solution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that has resulted in losing an encryption layer: the HTTP connection on port 5801 is unencrypted, but the typical VNC port (5901) continues to be encrypted.</p>
<h2 id="asking-once-about-equivalent-licenses">Asking Once About Equivalent Licenses</h2>
<p>After splitting SUSE Linux Enterprise in several modules, it was pretty common that the user had to accept a couple of equivalent licenses during the installation process. Given that the content for those licenses was pretty much the same, it was quite confusing. Actually, we got a bug report about the installation process being stuck asking the user to accept the license over and over (it was just the same license being shown for different modules).</p>
<p>In order to make our users happy, YaST is now able to decide whether two licenses are the same and, in that case, it will only ask once for acceptance. For the time being, YaST applies a hash function to license contents and compare the result, but most likely this mechanism will be refined in the future.</p>
<h2 id="license-confirmation-caasp-3.0">License Confirmation in CaaSP 3.0</h2>
<p>And talking about licenses, another small change about how they are handled was introduced in CaaSP 3.0. As you know, CaaSP features a One Dialog Installer and there was no room for the license to be shown. Now, before proceeding with the installation, YaST will show the license in the confirmation screen if needed.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/caasp-3-license-confirmation.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/caasp-3-license-confirmation-300x188.png" alt="CaaSP 3.0 License Confirmation Popup" width="300" height="188" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13166" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/caasp-3-license-confirmation-300x188.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/caasp-3-license-confirmation-768x482.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/caasp-3-license-confirmation-1024x643.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/caasp-3-license-confirmation.png 1176w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h2 id="improving-code-boot-option-handling">Improving the <code>addon</code> Boot Option Handling</h2>
<p>Back in February, we <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2018/02/22/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-51/#made-the-addon-linuxrc-option-work-well-with-the-packages-dvd" rel="nofollow">improved the <code>addon</code> boot option</a> to handle the SUSE Linux Packages DVD properly. However, during testing, we found out that if you are using a system which only has one DVD drive, the installation DVD will be automatically used as an <code>addon</code>.</p>
<p>In order to fix this conflict, if the installation media and the Packages DVD are going to use the same drive, YaST will ask the user to change the DVD before using it as an addon.</p>
<p>Additionally, we improved the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Linuxrc#p_addon" rel="nofollow">documentation of the addon boot option</a> adding new examples to clarify how the <code>dvd:///</code> URLs are handled.</p>
<h2 id="echoes-winter-white-text-white-background">Echoes of Winter: White Text on a White Background</h2>
<p>These days we fixed a bug that only allowed clairvoyant users to finish the installation of <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Kubic" rel="nofollow">openSUSE Kubic</a>.</p>
<p>The bug is pretty unremarkable but may we draw your attention to the related CSS styling engine? It powers the high-contrast color mode that you can select with F3 or with <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:YaST_tricks" rel="nofollow">Y2STYLE</a>:</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/linuxrc-color-mode-selection.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/linuxrc-color-mode-selection-150x150.png" alt="Linuxrc Color Mode Selection" width="150" height="150" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-13144" /></a></p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/installer-high-contrast.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/installer-high-contrast-150x150.png" alt="Installer in High Contrast Mode" width="150" height="150" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-13147" /></a></p>
<p>and if you press Ctrl-Alt-Shift-S (for <strong>s</strong>tyle) you can change the styling on the fly, as in this example of changing the background color:</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/installer-stylesheet-editor.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/installer-stylesheet-editor-300x233.png" alt="Installer Stylesheet Editor" width="300" height="233" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13165" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/installer-stylesheet-editor-300x233.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/installer-stylesheet-editor-768x598.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/installer-stylesheet-editor.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>openSUSE Leap 15.0 release is approaching and, as usual, we need help from our dear users to give testing versions a try and report bugs. Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2 id="installation-and-upgrade">Installation and Upgrade</h2>
<h3 id="clearer-description-of-migration-targets">Clearer Description of Migration Targets</h3>
<p>Life goes through various roads and it is same for SLE life. SLE15 is now split into multiple modules and during the upgrade it can be quite complex to pick the desired upgrade target. We have to react to this issue as customers start complaining that the upgrade overview starts to be hard to understand and we should improve it. So we did it and now you can check the changes on the attached screenshots. We modified the overview label from listing all products to just a summary with the details displayed below as it was before. Be aware that in the future and for some products or extensions/modules more migration targets will be possible.</p>

<h3 id="importing-the-smt-server-ssl-certificate-at-upgrade">Importing the SMT Server SSL Certificate at Upgrade</h3>
<p>We are still improving and fixing bugs in the migration from the SLE11 or SLE12 products to the new SLE15 line. One issue we fixed this sprint was importing the SSL server certificate from the old system at upgrade.</p>
<p>For registration you can use a local SMT server (<a href="https://www.suse.com/products/subscription-management-tool/">Subscription Management Tool</a>) instead of the usual SCC server (<a href="https://scc.suse.com">SUSE Customer Center</a>).</p>
<p>The SMT servers usually use a self-signed SSL certificate to save some money for buying a real certificate signed by a well-known certificate authority. This self-signed certificate is imported to the system by YaST during the initial registration so the registration process and the repositories from the server can be properly accessed.</p>
<p>But during the offline upgrade to SLE15 the old system is not running, the installer runs from the installation medium. In that case we need to import the SSL certificate from the old system to the installer so it can properly access the registration server and do the upgrade.</p>
<p>The certificate import is quite easy, we just need to be careful as SLE11 uses a different (old) path for storing the imported certificates than in SLE12 or SLE15.</p>
<p>As the result you should be now able not only to upgrade the systems registered against the SCC server but also the systems registered against your local SMT server.</p>
<h3 id="many-system-roles">Many System Roles</h3>
<p>Various products that we&#8217;re able to install have grown so many groups of presets, called System Roles, that they no longer fit on the screen. We applied some dark gray magic to make them fit in a scrollable box, at the expense of losing the keyboard shortcuts, sorry.</p>
<div class="figure"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-6.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-6-300x189.png" alt="" width="300" height="189" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13135" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-6-300x189.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-6.png 501w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></div>
<h2 id="storage">Storage</h2>
<h3 id="better-message-for-multipath-and-other-problems">Better Message for Multipath (and other) Problems</h3>
<p>While scanning the storage hardware, or at a later stage while manipulating it, there is always a chance of finding problems in the system that make it very hard to continue with the installation or the execution of YaST. In that case, previous versions of storage-ng used to show you a pop-up message with some technical details about what went wrong (for example, the command that failed and its output) and with options to abort YaST or continue despite the error.</p>
<p>But we found that for some situations we could do better in trying to understand what went wrong and explain it to you, instead of directly showing those raw technical details. One clear example is finding the same LVM physical volume twice, something that should never happen. Apart from double vision problems (libstorage-ng doesn&#8217;t drink alcohol), the most likely cause is that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_I/O">multipath system</a> is not being correctly detected and thus every one of the connections to the disk is being detected as a different disk, duplicating the content in the eyes of YaST.</p>
<p>Now such a circumstance is detected and explained to you, advising to use <code>LIBSTORAGE_MULTIPATH_AUTOSTART</code> (see <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Linuxrc#Special_parameters_not_handled_by_Linuxrc_itself">linuxrc documentation</a>) or the corresponding entry in the AutoYaST profile if it has not been used. By the way, during this sprint we also instructed storage-ng about <code>LIBSTORAGE_MULTIPATH_AUTOSTART</code>, since it used to ignore that ancient libstorage modifier.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-3.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-3-300x219.png" alt="" width="300" height="219" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13131" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-3-300x219.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-3-768x561.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-3.png 993w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></div>
<p>The technical details are still available under the &quot;Details&quot; button, as you can see below. They are simply not displayed at first sight, which should make the whole experience less daunting for less-experienced users. That change applies to all the severe errors found during the three critical phases of storage-ng: hardware activation, system probing, and commit (when the partitions and other devices are created).</p>
<div class="figure"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-4.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-4-300x217.png" alt="" width="300" height="217" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13132" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-4-300x217.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-4-768x556.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-4.png 1012w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
</div>
<p>Of course, the new pop-up messages have full support for AutoYaST. The most appropriate default option (continue or abort) is automatically selected depending on which one of the mentioned phases is being executed and, if AutoYaST is configured to display pop-ups, the usual countdown is displayed before doing such selection. See below the new generic error (for a different, unidentified problem) in action in AutoYaST.</p>
<div class="figure"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-5.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-5-300x228.png" alt="" width="300" height="228" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13133" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-5-300x228.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-5-768x585.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/s54-5.png 879w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>

<h3 id="autoyast-is-now-able-to-reuse-encrypted-devices">AutoYaST is now Able to Reuse Encrypted Devices</h3>
<p>As you may know, AutoYaST is quite flexible when it comes to partitioning, so we are still writing the final bits of the adaptation with the new storage layer. And this time, we were working on teaching AutoYaST how to reuse encrypted devices properly.</p>
<p>However, the implementation was not that straightforward, as the hardware probing occurs even before the partitioning section of the profile has been analyzed. And, in some scenarios, it is not clear which key should be used to unlock a device (for instance, this can happen when more than one encryption key is defined). To solve this problem, AutoYaST will try all defined keys on all encrypted devices until a working key is found.</p>
<p>Of course, this behavior is properly documented now in the AutoYaST handbook.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<h3 id="fixed-autoyast-profiles-validation-issues.">Fixed AutoYaST profiles validation issues.</h3>
<p>In our previous <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2018/03/23/yast-sprint-53/">blog entry</a> we already mentioned that there are significant changes between SLE12 and SLE15 profiles which have been documented in this <a href="https://susedoc.github.io/doc-sle/develop/SLES-autoyast/html/appendix.ay_12vs15.html">appendix</a>.</p>
<p>It is very common to adapt the profiles by hand which is error-prone and sometimes it is also hard to identify where the errors are just running an installation and looking deeply into the logs. That is why profiles validation using <code>xmllint</code> or <code>jing</code> is recommended (more info <a href="https://susedoc.github.io/doc-sle/develop/SLES-autoyast/html/Profile.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>During this sprint we have fixed some errors with the cloned profiles after installation which were not validating.</p>
<h3 id="translation-issues">Translation Issues</h3>
<p>We are receiving quite a lot of bugs regarding the translations. The usual problem is that some text is not translated at all and the original English text is displayed. This sprint we fixed several issues in this area, two of them are worth sharing in the blog.</p>
<h4 id="the-xsl-file-format">The XSL File Format</h4>
<p>The first problem was reported for missing translations in the role descriptions in the SLES4SAP product. The SLES4SAP installation basically behaves like the standard SLES installation just with changed few defaults. To avoid the duplication and make the SLES4SAP maintenance easier we simply take the original SLES XML control file, which describes the installer behavior and the defaults, and change just few values using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSL transformation</a> into the resulting SLES4SAP installer control file.</p>
<p>It turned out that the roles with missing translations were located in that XSL file. And unfortunately YaST did not support extracting the translatable strings from XSL files. However, we support translations in XML files and because a XSL file is actually a valid XML file we could easily extend the translation support in YaST to also cover the XSL files. So now the SLES4SAP roles are correctly translated.</p>
<h4 id="missing-textdomain-call">Missing <code>textdomain</code> Call</h4>
<p>We fixed several bugs with missing translations which were caused by missing <code>textdomain</code> call in the code. This call defines which POT file should be loaded and searched for the translations. If the YaST code does not use this call then obviously no text can be translated as YaST does not know which POT file should be used and it <em>silently</em> used the original untranslated text.</p>
<p>That means it was quite difficult to find why some text was not translated. And because that was quite common bug we had a nice idea to improve the situation by logging a warning into the YaST log with the exact message which could not be translated. And more importantly the log now also contains the location of the code which was trying to use the translation wrongly. See the <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-ruby-bindings/pull/214">pull request</a> for more details.</p>
<p>With the openQA team we discussed also the possibility to add a new check to openQA which would scan the YaST log for this particular warning and report a problem. Which means we should not overlook this quite important warning in the future.</p>

            <p>As the release dates for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 and openSUSE Leap 15 approach, we keep adapting YaST to make easier for our users to take advantage of all the new features that these rock-solid operating systems will bring.</p>
<p>During the last two weeks that has implied, apart from regular bug fixing that we usually don&#8217;t cover here, working on AutoYaST, improving Storage-ng and polishing several aspects related to modules and extensions, like their registration and licenses.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the rewritten Partitioner that is part of <code>yast2-storage-ng</code>.</p>
<h3>Partitioner: more flexibility with the partition id</h3>
<p>Setting the right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_type">partition id</a> (also known as partition type) for each partition is an important part of the system setup that is often overlooked. Our Partitioner has always displayed in a prominent place the widget allowing to set that id, suggesting always the best value based on the selected role and the chosen file system type. But in many cases, that was more than a simple suggestion. In the old Partitioner (and in the new one until this sprint) the value of the partition id field (Linux, swap, Linux LVM, etc.) could only be manually edited in case the user had selected to not format the partition. When the option &#8220;Format device&#8221; was selected, the automatically chosen value could not be changed.</p>
<p>In SLE15 and openSUSE Leap 15 (and quite soon in openSUSE Tumbleweed), it will be possible to modify the id, no matter if the partition is going to be formatted or not. Of course, the logic to propose the best option every time the user selects a file system type is still there, but now it can be always overridden if the user wish. That change resulted in a small rearrangement of the widgets in that screen, as you can see below (remember we are trying to be very conservative with the UI changes in the Partitioner).</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/partition_id.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/partition_id-300x207.png" alt="UI adjustments for the partition id" width="300" height="207" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13092" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/partition_id-300x207.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/partition_id-768x531.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/partition_id.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Partitioner: better support for DASD</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2018/03/09/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-52/">our previous report</a> we explained some of the aspects in which the Direct-access storage devices (DASD) used in s390 mainframes are different from regular hard disks. But as you can imagine, there are more differences&#8230; and we know our readers love to learn new stuff while enjoying our reports. 😉</p>
<p>In short, there are two possible kinds of DASDs devices: Extended Count Key Data (ECKD) and Fixed Block Architecture (FBA). As explained in the previous report, the ECKD devices need to be formatted at low-level in order to be used by the operating system and, moreover, there are two possible low-formats for them: Compatible Disk Layout (CDL) and Linux Disk Layout (LDL).</p>
<p>And now the fun &#8211; ECKD devices formatted as LDL do NOT have a partition table. FBA devices can potentially have one, but it&#8217;s also often skipped. To manage those DASDs without partition table, the Linux kernel simulates an implicit single partition taking the whole disk. Of course, working with such implicit partitions implies some restrictions, and we have introduced several controls to make sure things stay under control in the storage-ng Partitioner. For example, an error message is now shown if the user tries to remove an implicit partition.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/implicit.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/implicit-300x208.png" alt="Trying to delete an implicit partition" width="300" height="208" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13093" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/implicit-300x208.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/implicit-768x532.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/implicit.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> </p>
<p>For curious readers, there is more information about DASD available <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_aix_61/com.ibm.aix.kernextc/serial_direct_storage.htm">in this link</a>.</p>
<h3>Partitioner: can&#8217;t resize a partition&#8230; but why?</h3>
<p>In SLE15 and openSUSE Leap 15 we will report very detailed reasons why a partition or a file system cannot be resized, as you can see in this screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resizing.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resizing-300x187.png" alt="Detailed description of resizing restrictions" width="300" height="187" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13094" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resizing-300x187.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resizing-768x478.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resizing-1024x637.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/resizing.png 1354w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>This used to be just a very simplistic message &#8220;Device cannot be resized&#8221;. But there may be many reasons for that, and sometimes different restrictions might contradict each other: While some type of file system only lets you grow, not shrink (e.g. XFS), the partition that the file system is on might not be able to grow, for example because there is another partition right next to it. We want to minimize user frustration that might happen when we only report the first reason, and when the user somehow managed to fix that problem, show another one that can&#8217;t be fixed.</p>
<p>As usual, this feature will be available in Tumbleweed in a matter of days.</p>
<h3>Handling registration rollback in SLE15 Migration</h3>
<p>Of course, the Partitioner was not the only YaST area to get attention during this sprint. Several aspects related to products, modules and extensions were also worked, with all the implications they have about registration, migration and licenses.</p>
<p>For the offline migration to SLE15 we reused some parts from the online migration which handles service pack upgrade. But it tuned out that the reused part was not correctly integrated into the installer and in some corner cases (registration errors) it did not behave correctly.</p>
<p>Moreover if the upgrade failed early then the system still contained a SLE12 installation but was registered as a SLE15 system on the SCC server. After booting the original SLE12 system the access to the online repositories was broken.</p>
<p>This sprint we fixed that so in case of registration error or when going back the original registration is restored. Now you can go back and choose a different system to upgrade and it will work as expected.</p>
<p>Additionally we fixed some small issues with custom repositories (add-on or driver updates) used at upgrade.</p>
<h3>More fun with hiding/showing beta versions in SLE15</h3>
<p>Usual readers of our blog already know that SUSE is taking extensions and modules to a whole new level in SLE15, making them a cornerstone of the system installation and upgrade process. As already explained in previous posts, that implies more complex dependencies between extensions and modules. All those mechanisms usually work nice&#8230; except a small problem we found out with beta versions.</p>
<p>If a given extension was in beta phase and some of its dependencies were also in beta, if the &#8220;Hide Beta Versions&#8221; checkbox was unchecked the system was displaying only the extension selected by the user, but not the auto-selected dependent beta extensions. Our  SLE testers found that quite confusing. So to make everyone&#8217;s life easier, we fixed the behavior as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/beta_extensions.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/beta_extensions-300x227.png" alt="Displaying selected and auto-selected beta extensions" width="300" height="227" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13101" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/beta_extensions-300x227.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/beta_extensions-768x581.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/beta_extensions-1024x774.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/beta_extensions.png 1029w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>A look into the future: analyzing how we display licenses</h3>
<p>Currently there are many different ways to handle and display licenses. That can happen during the installation or upgrade process, while adding additional products to an installed system and, last but not least, while using YaST2 Firstboot to perform additional installation steps on the first system execution.</p>
<p>Additional there are 3 different locations from which these licenses come from. They can be provided by the SUSE Customer Center, be provided by libzypp or come from a repository using a legacy approach.</p>
<p>To simplify and unify all that in a close future, the first step was researching all those possibilities and how they are handled in (Auto)YaST. The result of such research can be found <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-packager/blob/master/doc/license_code_cleanup.md">in this document hosted on Github</a>.</p>
<h3>AutoYaST product selection and installer update improvements</h3>
<p>As you probably already know, starting with SLE-15, all products are distributed using one medium and you need to choose explicitly which product to install. Of course, if the medium only contains one product that would not be needed.</p>
<p>In AutoYaST profile the product is selected using the <code>/software/products/product</code> XML node:</p>
<pre>
&lt;software&gt;
  &lt;products config:type="list"&gt;
    &lt;product&gt;SLED&lt;/product&gt;
  &lt;/products&gt;
&lt;/software&gt;
</pre>
<p>Due to a bug, the cloned system exported the product <code>short_name</code> instead of the <code>name</code>, resulting in an internal error reported by the installer update and a later error during the auto-installation which aborted it because no product was selected.</p>
<p>So, during this sprint we have made improvements for both scenarios.</p>

<li>The installer update will not rely in the product selection at all (the installer is the same for all the products) but will use the <code>self_update_id</code> from the control file and the <code>version</code> and <code>architecture</code> from the first product available on the media. The <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-installation/blob/master/doc/SELF_UPDATE.md">installer update documentation</a> has been also updated according the last changes and it is probably the best place for knowing more about its behavior.</li>
<li>The wrong product selection error reported was not very useful and it was decided to provide more information about the list of available products from the media. Just see the image below with the latest implementation:</li>

<h3>Document main differences in AutoYaST profiles between SLE12 and SLE15</h3>
<p>The need to select a product is not the only relevant change affecting AutoYaST profiles for SLE15. There are many other significant changes in SLE15 compared to SLE12. Like the new modules concept, replacing <code>SuSEfirewall2</code> with <code>firewalld</code>, replacing <code>ntp</code> with <code>Chrony</code>&#8230; Users wanting to reuse existing SLE12 profiles with SLE-15, will probably need to adjust them.</p>
<p>We have created <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-autoinstallation/blob/master/doc/profile_changes_SLE15.md">this summary</a> describing some of the most important changes in order to help with the conversion.</p>
<p>That document is just a preliminary and temporary work that is currently being reviewed and improved by the awesome documentation team at SUSE. Very soon (probably already done at the time you are reading this) the content will be merged and a new section titled &#8220;Main differences between SLES 12 and 15 profiles&#8221; will be available in the <a href="https://susedoc.github.io/doc-sle/develop/SLES-autoyast/html/">current guide for AutoYaST</a>. Have we ever mentioned how much the doc team rocks? So please, use that last link as final reference instead of our temporary summary.</p>
<h3>Cron config for NTP client</h3>
<p>It is possible to setup the YaST-ntp-client module to sync the system clock at regular intervals. If that feature is used, YaST writes the needed configuration to a cron.d config file. We were still using &#8220;novell&#8221; as part of the name of such file, which was reported as a bug. It turned to be a good opportunity to take a look to a module that, as you can guess from that bug, we don&#8217;t update very often. 😉</p>
<p>First of all, we made sure that newly written files will have a more up-to-date name. Straightforward and easy.</p>
<p>The second part was to provide an upgrade path if the file already existed. We integrated that with the existing <code>ntp</code> to <code>chrony</code> conversion. That means the existing configuration is updated when a new version of the <code>yast2-ntp-client</code> package is installed, so the user does not need to run the module again to start using <code>chrony</code> with an existing configuration.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the third part was to adapt the package to be a better citizen in the RPM world, marking that file as ghost file in RPM spec. Now this command can recognize that <code>yast2-ntp-client</code> is responsible for that configuration file.</p>

<h3>Two months&#8230; and counting</h3>
<p>Only two months of countdown until the release date of openSUSE Leap 15! That means a lot of hard work ahead of us, so stay tuned for more updates.</p>

            <p>After adding many new features and introducing quite some important changes for the upcoming (open)SUSE releases, the YaST team is now going into <em>bug squashing mode</em>. We want to offer our users another rock solid release, so we are focusing on polishing our work.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to the storage layer, the story is slightly different. We are bringing back all those feature that you already know and love from the old Expert Partitioner but in a better shape.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s have a look at the most relevant changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have been working on improving the <a href="#offline-upgrade">system upgrade process</a> in order to offer a smooth transition.</li>
<li>The Expert Partitioner got back the <a href="#configuring-expert-partitioner">settings dialog</a> and the <a href="#cloning-disks">ability to clone disks</a>.</li>
<li>Regarding the new storage layer, <a href="#taking-btrfs-subvolume-hierarchy-right">subvolumes</a>, <a href="#temporary-mount-and-umount">resizing</a> and <a href="#better-handling-of-unformatted-dasd">support for unformatted DASD devices</a> have been improved.</li>
<li><a href="#yapi-is-deprecated">YaPI is now deprecated</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to that, we have fixed some issues like <a href="#package-installation-from-nfs-samba-cifs">package installation from NFS/Samba/CIFS repositories</a>, <a href="#preserving-dhcp-client-id">a problem preserving the DHCP client-id</a> and a bunch of <a href="#fixing-translation-issues">translations issues</a>.</p>
<h2 id="offline-upgrade">Offline Upgrade from SLE11</h2>
<p>In the previous post we announced support for the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/#offline-upgrade-using-bootable-media-via-scc">offline migration from SLE12 to SLE15 via SCC</a>. In this sprint we focused on upgrading from SLE11 products to SLE15.</p>
<p>The main difference (from the registration point of view) between SLE11 and SLE12/SLE15 is that SLE11 uses the old <em>Novell Customer Center</em> (NCC) for registration while the newer products use the <em>SUSE Customer Center</em> (SCC).</p>
<p>However, the SCC server knows which systems are registered in NCC (there is some kind of automatic synchronization between them) so it is possible to only use the SCC server during migration without any interaction with the old NCC. That makes the transition transparent for our users.</p>
<p>Besides some small adjustments, the changes in YaST were mainly related to handling the different configuration files. As expected, the most difficult part was testing, so we have added some notes below about the process.</p>
<p>In the end we could migrate a SLES11 system to SLES15 via SCC, performing a manual upgrade and an automated one with AutoYaST too. There were some issues related to package dependencies but these are not related to YaST or SCC, so probably some RPM packages will need to be fixed.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-upgrade-sle11-sle15.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-upgrade-sle11-sle15-300x225.png" alt="Select the Migration Target" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13068" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-upgrade-sle11-sle15-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-upgrade-sle11-sle15-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-upgrade-sle11-sle15.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>SLE11 Migration Notes</h3>
<p>When migrating from a SLE11 system, there are some specific issues you should be aware:</p>
<ul>
<li>The SLE11 systems registered using the <em>internal</em> SUSE registration keys (belonging to the <em>Novell Inc</em> organization) are synchronized every 24 hours. That means it might take up to 24 hours after registering a new SLE11 system to make it upgradable to SLE15 via SCC. If the registration has not been synchronized from NCC yet you will see the “Invalid credentials” error during migration.</li>
<li>For customers there is a trick: logging into the <a href="https://scc.suse.com">SCC Web UI</a> will cause the registrations to be syncrhonized in few minutes. But this does <em>not</em> work for the SUSE keys.</li>
<li>Migration from SLE12 is not affected by this issue because SLE12 already uses SCC and the data synchronization from NCC is not involved in the migration process.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Generic Migration Notes</h3>
<p>These notes apply when upgrading from both SLE11 or SLE12:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because SLE15 is in Beta stage, your registration key needs to be entitled for the Beta products. Otherwise you will see “No migration found” error in YaST. Either join the <a href="https://www.suse.com/betaprogram/">SUSE Beta program</a> or just wait until the SLE15 product is released and the migration is enabled.</li>
<li>Once the system is migrated, the process cannot be repeated. But if you rollback the migrated system (using a backup or a snapshot), running <code>SUSEConnect --rollback</code> will restore your registration status.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuring-expert-partitioner">Configuring the Expert Partitioner</h2>
<p>The Expert Partitioner features again a &#8220;Settings&#8221; section where users can adjust some settings to influence how the partitioner works. It is a work in progress, but for the time being the user can configure how the devices should be mounted (path, UUID, label, etc.).</p>
<p>But these settings are not only limited to the Expert Partitioner scope but to the whole storage layer. You could, for instance, launch again the Guided Setup after adjusting them and the new values will be taken into account.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-settings.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-settings-300x208.png" alt="" width="300" height="208" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13062" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-settings-300x208.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-settings-768x532.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-settings.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Moreover, the partitioner is now able to perform some additional checks over mount options. For example, when trying to mount a device by label, the user will be warned if that label is not valid (for instance, because there is another file system using that label).</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-fstab.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-fstab-300x207.png" alt="" width="300" height="207" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13063" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-fstab-300x207.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-fstab-768x529.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-fstab.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h2 id="cloning-partitions-layout">Cloning Partitions Layout</h2>
<p>Cloning partitions layout was one of that kind of surprising features the old Partitioner offered. Imagine you have a disk with some partitions and you would like to have the same partition layout in another disk (or even in several disks). This is very common, for example, when you are creating a MD RAID setup, where it is useful to have the disks partitioned in the same way. To avoid the annoying work of creating all disk partitions manually, the new Expert Partitioner allows again to clone a disk layout by using the Expert button.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-expert-button.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-expert-button-300x206.png" alt="" width="300" height="206" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13057" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-expert-button-300x206.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-expert-button-768x527.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-expert-button.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>When you are cloning a disk, you can select all the devices where you want to clone the partition scheme of the current disk. Only suitable devices for cloning will be offered, that is, you will not see in the list disks without enough size or different topology.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-cloning.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-cloning-300x208.png" alt="" width="300" height="208" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13058" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-cloning-300x208.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-cloning-768x532.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-cloning.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>After selecting in which disks you want to clone, a confirmation message will be presented and you will be warned about all devices that will be deleted before performing the disk cloning. In case you accept, you will have exactly the same partitions in all selected devices, including gaps between partitions. </p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-confirm-popup.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-confirm-popup-300x207.png" alt="" width="300" height="207" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13059" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-confirm-popup-300x207.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-confirm-popup-768x530.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/yast2-expert-partitioner-confirm-popup.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h2 id="temporary-mount-and-umount">Temporary Mount and Unmount File Systems for Resize</h2>
<p>Unfortunately most file systems support resizing only while the file system is mounted or while it is unmounted. Whereas doing a temporary mount is easy, a temporary unmount is often not possible since file systems are usually in use.</p>
<p>libstorage-ng now inserts unmount and mount actions when needed for a specific file system. It also provides function to immediately mount or unmount a file system, so that the UI can give feedback to the user if unmounting failed.</p>
<h2 id="taking-btrfs-subvolume-hierarchy-right">Taking Btrfs Subvolume Hierarchy Right</h2>
<p>btrfs subvolumes are rather delicate beasts and great care has to be taken to do things right.</p>
<p>For one, subvolumes are organized like a directory hierarchy. And you cannot create new subvolumes just anywhere but only in free &#8216;leaf&#8217; positions. That is, neither another subvolume nor a directory with this name must exist.</p>
<p>In other words, if (for example) a subvolume <code>foo/bar/xxx</code> already exists you can no longer create a subvolume <code>foo/bar</code>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what happens:</p>
<pre>
# you must mount the btrfs file system first
~ mount /dev/sdb5 /mnt
</pre>
<pre>
~ btrfs subvolume list -tap /mnt
ID      gen     parent  top level       path
--      ---     ------  ---------       ----
257     8       5       5               foo
258     8       257     257             /foo/bar/xxx

~ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/foo/bar
ERROR: target path already exists: /mnt/foo/bar
</pre>
<p>The reason for that error is that there is already a directory called `foo/bar`. At this point, there are two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete the subvolume <code>foo/bar/xxx</code> and the directory <code>foo/bar</code> if you do not mind to loose the data in that subvolume</li>
<li>Or rename temporarily and move it back later</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s move the existing subvolume out of the way (no fancy command, just using <code>mv</code>) and then create the new one:</p>
<pre>
~ mv /mnt/foo/bar /mnt/foo/old_bar
~ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/foo/bar
Create subvolume '/mnt/foo/bar'
~ mv /mnt/foo/old_bar/xxx /mnt/foo/bar/xxx
~ rmdir /mnt/foo/old_bar

~ btrfs subvolume list -tap /mnt
ID      gen     parent  top level       path
--      ---     ------  ---------       ----
257     9       5       5               foo
258     8       259     259             /foo/bar/xxx
259     9       257     257             /foo/bar
</pre>
<p>That&#8217;s rather a complicated stunt and you even might have valuable data in the old `foo/bar` directory that could get lost in the process. So YaST refuses to do this.</p>
<p>Instead, it recognizes the situation and shows a hint to the user:</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cannot-create-subvolume.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cannot-create-subvolume-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13055" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cannot-create-subvolume-300x300.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cannot-create-subvolume-150x150.jpg 150w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cannot-create-subvolume.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s all different if you are about to format the btrfs filesystem anyway. Then the YaST partitioner will simply create the subvolumes in the correct order and everything will be fine.</p>
<h2 id="better-handling-of-unformatted-dasd">Better handling of unformatted DASD and other unavailable devices</h2>
<p>Direct-access storage devices (DASD) are the most common storage devices in s390 mainframes. When compared to common hard disks, they are special in several ways. One of them is that they need to be formatted at low-level (to not be confused with the usual meaning of &#8220;format&#8221; related to creating a file system) in order to be used by the operating system.</p>
<p>We got a bug report for the pre-release of SLE15 because the installer was crashing when trying to use an unformatted DASD as part of the automatic partitioning proposal (i.e. the Guided Setup). So we instructed YaST to ignore such devices, not only in the automatic proposal but also in the Partitioner. It makes very little sense to list devices in the Partitioner that cannot be manipulated in any way. That&#8217;s consistent with the SLE15 approach for other &#8220;untouchable&#8221; devices, like the hard disks that are part of a BIOS-defined RAID or the individual connections of a <a href="https://trello.com/c/cgDMlMWF/283-2-proposal-change-existing-partition-table-to-the-preferred-type">multipath device</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, the &#8220;Hard Disks&#8221; section of the Partitioner only shows disks that can be indeed used as disks (e.g. can be partitioned) and, unlike previous SLE15 pre-releases, now unformatted DASDs are not longer in that list. As always, the user can still go a couple of steps back in the installation process and perform a low-level format the DASD in order to make them appear.</p>
<h2 id="yapi-is-deprecated">YaPI is deprecated and should not be used anymore</h2>
<p>Dropping some old stuff is part of our roadmap too. For instance during this sprint, we have marked <a href="https://fate.suse.com/323734">YaPI as deprecated</a>.</p>
<p>YaPI was designed to expose functionalities from YaST but, to be honest, it is not much used these days. Due to the complexity to maintain several interfaces every time we develop a new feature, we have decided to drop YaPI. Although the code has not been completely removed, we consider it as deprecated and it should not be used anymore.</p>
<h2 id="installing-packages-from-nfs-samba-cifs">Installing Packages from NFS or Samba/CIFS</h2>
<p>We got a bug report that when installing a system from an NFS repository, the installed system will be unable to access that repository later.</p>
<p>The problem was that for accessing the NFS repositories (and Samba/CIFS as well) you need additional packages which can mount such file systems. And these packages are not included in the minimal installation. </p>
<p>That means you cannot access the repository later which is a quite unfortunate situation. You get into the chicken/egg problem &#8211; you need to install a package to access the repository but to access the repository you need to have the package already installed&#8230;</p>
<p>During debugging it turned out that the problem was caused by using a dropped value from the `/etc/install.inf` file. In the past, linuxrc wrote the type of the installation repository there, but that&#8217;s not written anymore.</p>
<p>The fix was to evaluate all used repositories and check if any of them is located on an NFS or Samba/CIFS system. As a side effect, it fixed an issue when installing from DVD but using an additional repository located on NFS (or Samba/CIFS).</p>
<h2 id="preserving-dhcp-client-id">Preserving the DHCP client-id</h2>
<p>Since SLE15, wicked will use the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4361">RFC 4361</a> client-id. This change needed some adaptation in the installer to copy the created identity (<code>duid + daid</code>) to the installed system so, after rebooting, it can get the same IP (when it is possible) that was used during the installation.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-text-domains">Fixing Translation Issues</h2>
<p>Currently we are getting quite a lot of bugs about missing translations in YaST. It turned out that some bugs were caused by a missing <code>textdomain</code> statement in the YaST code. In such situations, no translatable texts are extracted from those files and, obviously, translators cannot translate them.</p>
<p>The YaST script printed a warning in that case, but it can be easily overlooked. The reason for a warning is that the check is not perfect and it reports many false positives (it complains about missing <code>textdomain</code> calls that are not required).</p>
<p>Fixing the script would be too difficult so we took other approach: we added the harmless <code>textdomain</code> statement also to files which strictly did not require it. Then we could change the warning to error and stop the script with a failure.</p>
<p>Now the more strict check is enabled in the continuous integration (Travis) so we should get a failure earlier, before the change actually hits the build service, preventing bug reports later.</p>
<h2>We need your help!</h2>
<p>Our QA department is doing a pretty good job when it comes to detect problems. But we would love to get feedback from you too. So, if possible, have a look at (open)SUSE beta versions and report any issue you find.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2 id="installation-and-upgrade">Installation and Upgrade</h2>
<h3 id="offline-upgrade-using-bootable-media-via-scc">Offline Upgrade Using Bootable Media via SCC</h3>
<p>The last few weeks we spent quite some time implementing the offline migration from the old SUSE Linux Enterprise products (versions 11 and 12) to the upcoming version 15.</p>
<p>Note: the <em>offline migration</em> term actually means that your production system is not booted and running, it is not about the network status. At offline migration a different system is booted (usually from a DVD). See more details in the <a href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/singlehtml/book_sle_deployment/book_sle_deployment.html#sec.update.sle.methods">official SUSE documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We implemented and tested the upgrade from SLE 12 SP3. The offline migration workflow is similar to the online migration as implemented in SLE 12 release. The only difference is that you boot the SLE 15 medium, select <em>Upgrade</em> in the boot menu and then select the disk partition to upgrade. The rest should be the same as in the online migration.</p>
<p>The migration from SLE 11 is a bit more complex as it is registered against the older <em>Novell</em> Customer Center and requires some additional changes in the installer. This is work in progress.</p>
<p>And the last note: for <em>testing</em> the offline migration to SLE 15, your system needs to be registered using the Beta registration keys. For regular SLE 12 and 11 registrations, the migration to SLE 15 is blocked. It will be unblocked after the SLE15 has been officially released.</p>
<h3 id="made-the-addon-linuxrc-option-work-well-with-the-packages-dvd">Made the <code>addon</code> Linuxrc Option Work Well with the Packages DVD</h3>
<p>In SLE 15 there are numerous modules and extensions, such as the Live Patching module, or the Web Scripting module. On physical DVDs, we are putting all of them on a single Packages DVD.</p>
<p>When you are installing SLES and choose to add such a module during the installation from the DVD, you will be presented with a screen to select from all the modules found on the DVD.</p>
<p>You can also automate this step by passing the <code>addon=dvd:///</code> option at the installation boot prompt. (See <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Linuxrc#p_addon">the Linuxrc reference</a>). Formerly this worked only with single-product media. Starting <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-add-on/pull/49">now</a>, the <code>addon</code> option will work also with multi-product media such as the Packages DVD.</p>
<h3 id="improve-licenses-translations-support">Improve Licenses Translations Support</h3>
<p>Some months ago, YaST started to use libzypp to get product licenses, instead of using the old SUSE Tags approach. However, until this sprint, this feature was somehow incomplete.</p>
<p>On one hand, the complete list of supported languages was shown, no matter whether a translation was available for a given language or not. On the other hand, the &quot;Licenses Translation&quot; button was missing (it is still used in single product media).</p>
<div class="figure">
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-1.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-1-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13044" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-1-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-1-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-1.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
</div>
<p>Now both problems are solved and, as soon as new translations are included in the installation media, they should be handled gracefully in the installer.</p>
<h2 id="replaced-components">Replaced Components</h2>
<h3 id="finalize-xinetd-conversion-to-systemd-sockets">Finalize Xinetd Conversion to Systemd Sockets</h3>
<p>This sprint we finished our <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2018/02/09/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-50/">change from xinetd to systemd sockets for starting services on demand</a>. To finalize it there is basically two main tasks.</p>
<p>The first one was dropping the YaST module for xinetd. That required a conversion of yast2-ftp-server that used this module and also adding a note to AutoYaST that xinetd configuration is no longer supported, so if you have it in your AutoYaST profile, it won&#8217;t be applied. The FTP server part was harder because, as mentioned in the last report, one of the two backends does not support systemd sockets, but we found that this backend is a bit ancient and support for us was quite painful. The result is that we dropped pure-ftp and kept only vsftpd backend, which makes the code much simplier and our life better (the final diff-stat is +1100/-3700). And then we converted the usage to systemd sockets. Then we could proceed to dropping yast2-inetd because there was no dependency anymore.</p>
<p>The second task was xinetd usage directly, with an API for starting on demand. It is not used too often and in the end the biggest parts were dropping xinetd usage for VNC based installation and yast2-inst-server which is now converted to use systemd sockets. And here we can give you a nice trick we discovered during the implementation: If a systemd service has a parameter (often the case with services started by a systemd socket) you can stop all of them with a wildcard, e.g. <code>systemctl stop vnc@*</code>.</p>
<p>So here is a happy end &#8211; after this sprint there is no xinetd usage and we can support only one tool for starting on demand, allowing us to focus on improving other parts.</p>
<h3 id="added-support-for-exporting-firewalld-autoyast-configuration">Added support for exporting firewalld AutoYaST configuration</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2018/02/09/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-50/">previous blog entry</a> we announced AutoYaST support for configuring firewalld but cloning the firewall configuration was not supported yet and also the AutoYaST summary concerning the Firewall module needed some love and that is basically what we have implemented during this sprint.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-9.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-9-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13048" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-9-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-9-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-9.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
</div>
<p>It should be noted that editing of the AutoYaST Firewall configuration is not allowed since the firewall configuration is now done with the firewalld graphical configuration tool (firewall-config)</p>
<h2 id="storage-and-partitioner">Storage and Partitioner</h2>
<h3 id="added-the-format-options-dialog-to-the-partitioner">Added the Format Options Dialog to the Partitioner</h3>
<p>One of the missing things in the new partitioner was the format options dialog letting you tune the file system a bit when it is created.</p>
<p>The options itself are more or less the same as in the old partitioner. This feature is intended more for the experts. As an average user you will rarely find a need to fine-tune file system parameters. But in case you do, the dialog is there to aid you (remember the help button).</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the ext4 options:</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<h3 id="removed-the-empty-views-in-the-partitioner">Removed the Empty Views in the Partitioner</h3>
<p>In the process of rewriting the YaST storage stack, we also rewrote the partitioner. Some views in the partitioner were taken over from the old one, but not filled with any functionality so far &#8211; they only showed empty pages. We now removed those empty pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypt Files</li>
<li>Device Mapper</li>
<li>Unused Devices</li>
<li>Mount Graph</li>
<li>Settings (this one will be back soon with content)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what it looks like now:</p>
<div class="figure">
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-3.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-3-182x300.png" alt="" width="182" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13042" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-3-182x300.png 182w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-3.png 509w" sizes="(max-width: 182px) 100vw, 182px" /></a>

<h3 id="installation-summary-in-the-partitioner">Installation Summary in the Partitioner</h3>
<p>One of the sections that survived the Partitioner sifting mentioned above was the Installation Summary. During this sprint we re-implemented this useful view that shows the changes that would be performed in the system, including packages to install in order for the system to work with the chosen technologies. One image is worth a thousand words.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-5.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-5-300x215.png" alt="" width="300" height="215" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13040" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-5-300x215.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-5-768x551.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-5.png 999w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
</div>
<p>Of course, the information in both lists is updated with every change done in the Partitioner and, as usual, everything works as a charm also in text mode. Including the possibility of collapsing or extending the (usually lengthy) list of operations on subvolumes.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-6.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-6-300x166.png" alt="" width="300" height="166" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13039" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-6-300x166.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/s51-6.png 714w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
</div>
<h3 id="blocker-errors-in-partitioner">Blocker Errors in Partitioner</h3>
<p>A few sprints ago we implemented warnings in the partitioner that inform you if something looks like probably not working, but with expert knowledge it can be made working. Now we add also blocking errors where we are sure it won&#8217;t work. It is just a first draft so it will be adapted as needed and as problems appear. Some checks are already moved from the bootloader to the partitioner, so you can fix the partitioning quickly. But enough words, check out the screenshots, where the first one is an error which prevents continuing and the second one is just a warning.</p>

<h3 id="extending-the-autoyast-device-element">Extending the AutoYaST &lt;device&gt; Element</h3>
<p>When defining a <code>&lt;drive&gt;</code> section in an AutoYaST profile, the <code>&lt;device&gt;</code> element should determine to which disk you want to apply that partitioning schema. Usually, it is a device kernel name, like <code>/dev/sda</code>, or a link which resolves to a disk (for instance, <code>/dev/disk/by-id/*</code>, <code>/dev/disk/by-path</code>, etc.).</p>
<p>However, AutoYaST supports specifying other names, like <code>by-partlabel</code>, <code>by-label</code>, etc. Those links won&#8217;t resolve directly to a disk, but the storage layer will be able to find out which disk they belong to.</p>
<p>Although SLE 12 supported this behaviour, it was missing from SLE 15 until this sprint.</p>
<h3 id="fine-tuning-of-the-requirements-to-boot-a-system">Fine-tuning of the Requirements to Boot a System</h3>
<p>In some situations, an extra partition or a given disk layout is needed to boot an (open)SUSE operating system. Like the separate <code>/boot</code> partition needed in some corner-case legacy scenarios, the ESP partition that must be mounted at <code>/boot/efi</code> in EFI systems or the PReP partition needed by some PowerPC systems. The partitioning proposal performed by the installer tries to ensure those booting requirements are met (so does AutoYaST in some cases) and our beloved Partitioner also includes some checks to warn you user if you forget to create or mount any of those partitions.</p>
<p>But in some situations, the installer was suggesting partitions with a suboptimal size or even partitions that were not strictly needed. On the other hand, the Partitioner was sometimes being too picky, warning about situations that were not such a big problem. So during this sprint we refined our list of booting requirements, updating the corresponding documentation, relaxing the partitioner checks and fine-tuning the proposal outcome. Specifically the PowerPC requirements were revamped based on the input from several experts and bug reports from manufacturers of some systems.</p>
<p>So no matter if you usually trust the installer proposal, if you like to handcraft stuff with the Partitioner or if you install using AutoYaST, the experience should be more smooth now, which fewer (if any) ugly surprises at boot time.</p>
<h3 id="mount-options-revisited-when-the-old-demons-come-back-to-haunt-you">Mount Options Revisited: When the Old Demons Come back to Haunt You</h3>
<p>Recently, we reintroduced per-filesystem-type defaults for mount options. We thought this would be a great chance to clean up old code that had become messy over time; we thought we could provide a clean, well-structured and easy-to-understand way to do this.</p>
<p>Then people began to test some more scenarios, and we found out the hard way that in some situations, those mount options depend on the mount point for various reasons: Some quirks of underlying kernel modules like the VFAT filesystem or the way systemd handles mounting the root filesystem during booting made this necessary.</p>
<p>So we had to bite the bullet and reintroduce some of that old code which was kind of messy; for example, for ext4 or ext3 root filesystems, we no longer specify any <code>data=...</code> mount options because this might make remounting the root filesystem read/write at boot time fail; in another case, a <code>mkdir -p /boot/efi/EFI</code> (when installing the boot loader) on a VFAT partition failed despite VFAT technically being case-insensitive (omitting <code>iocharset=utf8</code> fixed this).</p>
<p>Lesson learned: Some messy old code is messy for a reason. Trying to streamline it may break some scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The answers to the initial questions are</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>说不定.</li>
<li>Most of the time.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the SLE release cycle is shifting from the &quot;all features are mandatory&quot; phase to the &quot;all bugs are top priority&quot; phase, expect less of feature news and more bugfix news in the next report, due in two weeks.</p>

            <p>Sprint 50 is finished and we are ready to share with you all the highlights of this last sprint!</p>
<p>We are close to finishing features for the new SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, so this time we came up with a lot of information about the new storage, partitioner, firewall enhancements, and roles, which now is also present for the Desktop version of SUSE Linux Enterprise. Besides that, we fought another issue regarding memory consumption in Tumbleweed installation and once again we were able to solve it. So, let&#8217;s take a look into details!</p>
<h3>Filesystem type specific default mount options in /etc/fstab are back</h3>
<p>We reimplemented another feature that was still missing with the rewrite of the YaST storage stack: Reasonable mount options in <em>/etc/fstab</em> that may be different for each filesystem type. For example, for an Ext4 filesystem we used to set options <code>data=ordered,acl,user_xattr</code> by default. Of course, you can still change those options in the partitioner if the defaults don&#8217;t work well for you.</p>
<p>For most filesystem types, this was straightforward: Just filling a table with fixed default options. But for some others, most notably the legacy Microsoft filesystem types FAT/VFAT, this involved some not-so-trivial heuristics to figure out locale data so we could provide reasonable values for <code>iocharset=...</code> and <code>codepage=...</code>; those are necessary to recode filenames with non-ASCII international characters between whatever a MS Windows system might use and Linux; otherwise, you might not even see those files when mounted on a Linux system.</p>
<h3> Resurrected sections in the Expert Partitioner </h3>
<p>We keep bringing the functionality from the old Partitioner back to the Storage-ng reimplementation. During this sprint, it was the turn of the NFS and Device Graph sections.</p>
<p>The NFS case is a little bit special from the technical point of view since it&#8217;s the only section not managed directly by the Expert Partitioner. Instead, an embedded version of <code>yast2-nfs-client</code> is executed when visiting that section. The same approach has been followed in this reimplementation, which means NFS is the only section in which the old Partitioner and its Storage-ng clone will offer an absolutely identical experience and behavior (including both features and bugs). Just a heads-up: NFSv4 support is still not fully functional in <code>libstorage-ng</code>, so the check-boxes about the NFS version may be ignored until that support reaches your distribution.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nfs.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nfs-300x177.png" alt="" width="300" height="177" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12987" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nfs-300x177.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nfs-768x452.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nfs.png 928w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, the &#8220;Device Graph&#8221; section was, as most of the new Partitioner, rewritten from scratch. In addition to the already known graph showing how the system is going to look after applying the changes, it includes now a representation of the current system in a separate tab. Both graphs are interactive, double-click on any node takes the user to the corresponding section of the Partitioner.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/device_graphs.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/device_graphs-300x177.png" alt="" width="300" height="177" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12988" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/device_graphs-300x177.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/device_graphs-768x452.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/device_graphs.png 934w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see in the previous screenshot, the usual button to export the graph to Graphviz format is not alone anymore. Its new friend allows exporting the graph to the very detailed XML format used by the YaST Team to reproduce test scenarios.</p>
<p>Of course, the &#8220;Device Graph&#8221; section is not available if using the text-based ncurses interface, as you can see comparing the left part of the following screenshot with the previous one.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/exp_ncurses.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/exp_ncurses-300x188.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12989" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/exp_ncurses-300x188.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/exp_ncurses.png 761w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3> Partitioner: LVM thin provisioning </h3>
<p>Our new Expert Partitioner was already able to manage LVM volume groups and logical volumes since several weeks ago. But now it also recovers its great ability to work with LVM thin pools and volumes. LVM thin provisioning is a powerful technology, very useful in cases where you need to administrate storage resources for a large group of users. Basically, thin provisioning allows you to provide more storage space than it is actually available in the system. You can increase the real hardware storage only when it is really required. For more information about LVM thin provisioning, you can find a great guide in <a href="https://storageapis.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/lvm-thin-provisioning">this link</a>.</p>
<p>With the Expert Partitioner, you can create a thin pool over a LVM volume group in a similar way you create a normal logical volume. You only have to add a new logical volume and check the &#8220;Thin pool&#8221; option in the first dialog. Once the volume group contains at least a thin pool, you will be able to create thin volumes. Once again, the process is exactly the same. Add a new logical volume and select &#8220;Thin volume&#8221; option and in which pool to create it. The rest of steps are exactly the same as for creating a normal logical volume.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/exp_partitio.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/exp_partitio-300x208.png" alt="" width="300" height="208" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12990" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/exp_partitio-300x208.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/exp_partitio-768x533.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/exp_partitio.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Apart from creating new thin pools and volumes, options for editing, resizing and deleting are now also available for all kind of logical volumes: normal volumes, thin pools and thin volumes. In the case of resizing a thin pool, you will be warned when the resulting pool is overcommitted. Take a look at the following screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/resize_lvm.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/resize_lvm-300x208.png" alt="" width="300" height="208" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12991" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/resize_lvm-300x208.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/resize_lvm-768x532.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/resize_lvm.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3> Adapting partitions and logical volumes sizes in AutoYaST</h3>
<p>In older versions, when the proposed partitioning in a profile and it did not fit in the disk, AutoYaST tried its best to reduce the biggest partition. A typical use case was to set the root (/) partition to a huge value, so the profile could be used in systems with different disk sizes (as AutoYaST will take care of reducing that partition to make it fit). To be honest, the best solution in that scenario would be to set the size to <code>max</code>, so AutoYaST will do what&#8217;s expected.</p>
<p>However, if for any reason the wanted layout does not fit, AutoYaST is now smarter about what to do: instead of blindly reducing the biggest one, it will try to reduce all partitions in a (kind of) proportional way, informing the user about the new sizes.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/autoyast_lvm.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/autoyast_lvm-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12992" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/autoyast_lvm-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/autoyast_lvm-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/autoyast_lvm.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3> Small behavior change in AutoYaST installation</h3>
<p>Up to now, not installable packages have been ignored silently by AutoYaST, which has been defined in the AutoYaST configuration file. From now on, the user will be informed that these packages cannot be installed.</p>
<h3>System roles for SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 15</h3>
<p>SUSE Linux Enterprise uses system roles to define, during the installation process, the packages to install on the system, so it can have the necessary software to play its &#8220;role&#8221;. This feature was already available for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and now it is also available for SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop. In order to choose a specific role for your system, you need to select a module or extension which contains this role during the installation process. There are four available roles for Desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNOME Desktop (Wayland): available when Desktop Productivity (on SLED) or Workstation Extension are selected.</li>
<li>GNOME Desktop (X11): available when Desktop Productivity (on SLED) or Workstation Extension are selected.</li>
<li>GNOME Desktop (Basic): available when the Desktop Application module is selected.</li>
<li>IceWM Desktop (Minimal): available when Basesystem module is selected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Firewalld enhancements</h3>
<p>During the last sprints, our team has been working hard in the integration of firewalld with AutoYaST and with the CWM library for opening ports / services in our different modules (http-server, squid, dns-server etc..). Here are some changes we did during this last sprint:</p>
<p><b>YaST firewall module is discontinued</b></p>
<p>As we now adopted firewalld in our distribution, there is no more reasons to have a YaST module for the firewall. Therefore, as you may see <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-firewall/blob/master/README.md">here</a>, we discontinued the YaST Firewall module and we recommend to use firewall-config to configure your firewall via a user interface or firewall-cmd for the command line.</p>
<p><b>AutoYaST</b></p>
<p>A new AutoYaST schema has been defined for firewalld configuration although the features supported are very limited.</p>
<p>We can configure properties like the default zone, the service state, the type of packages to be logged and zones specific configuration like interfaces, services, ports, protocols, and sources.</p>
<p>For example, a SuSEFirewall2 based profile defining some interfaces, services, and ports in the EXT zone  like this one:</p>
<pre>
&lt;firewall&gt; 
  &lt;enable_firewall config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/enable_firewall&gt;
  &lt;start_firewall config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/start_firewall&gt;
  &lt;FW_DEV_EXT&gt;eth0&lt;/FW_DEV_EXT&gt;
  &lt;FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP&gt;443 80 8080&lt;/FW_SERVICES_EXT_TCP&gt;
  &lt;FW_SERVICES_EXT_UDP&gt;21 22&lt;/FW_SERVICES_EXT_UDP&gt;
  &lt;FW_CONFIGURATIONS_EXT&gt;dhcp dhcpv6 samba vnc-server&lt;/FW_CONFIGURATIONS_INT&gt;
&lt;/firewall&gt;
</pre>
<p>will be translated to something like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;firewall&gt;
  &lt;enable_firewall config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/enable_firewall&gt;
  &lt;start_firewall config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/start_firewall&gt;
  &lt;default_zone&gt;public&lt;/default_zone&gt;
  &lt;zones config:type="list"&gt;
    &lt;zone&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;public&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;interfaces config:type="list"&gt;
        &lt;interface&gt;eth0&lt;/interface&gt;
      &lt;/interfaces&gt;
      &lt;services config:type="list"&gt;
        &lt;service&gt;dhcp&lt;/service&gt;
        &lt;service&gt;dhcpv6&lt;/service&gt;
        &lt;service&gt;samba&lt;/service&gt;
        &lt;service&gt;vnc-server&lt;/service&gt;
      &lt;/services&gt;
      &lt;ports config:type="list"&gt;
        &lt;port&gt;21/udp&lt;/port&gt;
        &lt;port&gt;22/udp&lt;/port&gt;
        &lt;port&gt;80/tcp&lt;/port&gt;
        &lt;port&gt;443/tcp&lt;/port&gt;
        &lt;port&gt;8080/tcp&lt;/port&gt;
      &lt;/ports&gt;
    &lt;/zone&gt;
  &lt;/zones&gt;
&lt;/firewall&gt;
</pre>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ay_firewall.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ay_firewall-300x176.png" alt="" width="300" height="176" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12993" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ay_firewall-300x176.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ay_firewall.png 378w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>  </p>
<p>SuSEFirewall2 based profiles will continue working although limited to the configuration currently supported by YaST.</p>
<p>During the autoinstallation, an error will be shown if the profile has some property not supported, however, we will able to continue with the installation and also a warning will be shown suggesting the use of the new schema even when all the properties are translatable.</p>
<p><b>Opening ports / services in zones through interfaces selection</b></p>
<p>In YaST, CWMFirewallInterfaces module provides a set of widget definitions for opening services in zones through a selection of interfaces (each interface belongs to a ZONE).</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CWMFirewallInterfaces.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CWMFirewallInterfaces-300x44.png" alt="" width="300" height="44" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12994" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CWMFirewallInterfaces-300x44.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CWMFirewallInterfaces.png 523w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CWMFirewallInterfaces_.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CWMFirewallInterfaces_-300x156.png" alt="" width="300" height="156" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12995" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CWMFirewallInterfaces_-300x156.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CWMFirewallInterfaces_.png 466w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The module has been adapted to work properly with the new firewalld API.</p>
<p>If a <em>firewalld service</em> is not defined (probably because the package shipping the service definition has not been adapted yet), then the <em>CWMFirewallInterfaces</em> widget will show a list of missing services suggesting to deploy them to be able to configure the firewall.</p>
<h3>Move from Xinetd to Systemd sockets</h3>
<p>As requested by our friends from packages, now the future of starting service on demand is systemd sockets instead of xinetd. There are multiple reasons for that, but for us the most important one is that we can concentrate in one thing and do it properly. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to support different ways to start services on demand and especially to handle such a situation when a user can set it up with sockets. Our old approach to make it happen was to set up the start of services on demand with xinetd. However, this approach is really hard to debug. Besides this problem, we also would like to unify our approach with the one suggested by packagers people.</p>
<p>So what have we done in this last sprint? The goal was to do some research, to create a proof of concept on one specific module and to find potential obstacles when unifying approaches to start services on demand. We found out that the conversion from xinetd to systemd sockets is quite easy, but also cannot be done automatically. Basically, what we need to do is to use systemctl call (which we already support) to activate the socket that is provided by the package instead of our old approach, which is to write a file into /etc/xinetd.d/ and to reload xinetd. Such a change will make our life much easier than previously.</p>
<p>The hardest part is that xinetd configuration file also often contains the service configuration that YaST can and would like to modify. This is no longer possible with systemd sockets and it is also the reason that we cannot automate this conversion.</p>
<p>So how will we proceed with the conversion of the YaST modules? We first checked all modules that use xinetd and we verified that, for the majority, the conversion is straight-forward. YaST also has a module for inetd configuration, which no longer makes sense, so the plan is to drop it in the near future and to allow socket activation in services manager module.</p>
<p>A problematic module is ftp-server, which supports two backends: vsftp and pure-ftp. This is problematic because pure-ftp does not support systemd-sockets, only xinetd. We plan to discuss how to handle it, as we are also not happy that we support two backends, because it makes the life of our users harder when they just want to quickly configure a ftp server. For SLE users we already support only vstftp, so if we agree on it, we will probably also support only this server in YaST. But right now nothing is set in stone.</p>
<h3>Memory eating strikes again</h3>
<p>Once again we have to mention our battle with memory consumption. This time the problem happened within the NET iso for Tumbleweed, which should need no more than 1 GiB of memory during the installation process. </p>
<p>In the beginning of our research, we had no suspicious code to look at, we just knew that it could be related to the fact that the NET iso was using the whole repository of Tumbleweed (over 60k packages) while the DVD iso uses only a subset of packages.</p>
<p>So which technique did we use to find the problematic part of the code? We changed logging in order to append the memory status of the whole process to each log line. By using this approach we quickly identified the problematic part of the code. This problematic code was responsible only for logging, but as it was searching for all packages and loading all packages properties, it was consuming a huge amount of data and causing this memory issue.</p>
<p>As a hotfix, we removed this logging from packages and kept it only for patterns and products, which is more important for us and has low memory consumption. We also looked into all code that searches through all packages properties and we reduced it as much as we could. Finally, we forced the Ruby garbage collector to run before the processes of disk preparation and rpm installation, reducing the chances that the memory consumption of the installation process goes up.</p>
<p>Once again we had a happy end and we are now able to install the NET iso with 1 GiB of memory when using the graphical installer.</p>
<h3>Concluding</h3>
<p>As we&#8217;re getting closer to finish SLES 15, we&#8217;re getting busier and busier with features and bugs to finish. Therefore, YaST team is already working hard on Sprint 51 and we&#8217;re looking forward to come back to you in two weeks with much more cool stuffs that we&#8217;re doing. Meanwhile, have fun and stay tuned!</p>

            <p>Time goes by and the YaST wheel keeps rolling. So let&#8217;s take a look to what have moved since our <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2018/01/09/highlights-of-yast-development-sprint-48/">previous development report</a>.</p>
<h3>More flexible NET installation ISOs</h3>
<p>Network installation media for Tumbleweed or Leap only work properly with the exact repository they have been built for &#8211; which for Tumbleweed may mean they could be outdated after just one day.</p>
<p>You would then run into this message:</p>

<p>To improve the situation the installer can now offer to download matching boot files (kernel and <code>initrd</code>, to be precise) from the repository if it detects this situation:</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/linuxrc_net2.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/linuxrc_net2-300x167.jpg" alt="Linuxrc offering a solution, as always" width="300" height="167" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12962" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/linuxrc_net2-300x167.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/linuxrc_net2.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, you can say &#8216;No&#8217; here &#8211; but then you&#8217;re back to the red dialog. 😀</p>
<p>Technically, what&#8217;s done is to download a new kernel/initrd pair from the repository and restart the installation process with them (using kexec). So be prepared for a slight déjà vu.</p>
<p>This feature is controlled by the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Linuxrc#p_kexec"><code>kexec</code></a> boot option.</p>
<h3>Storage-ng lands into Tumbleweed: handle with care</h3>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the only news we have about openSUSE Tumbleweed. Our usual readers already know about Storage-ng, our effort to rewrite the whole YaST storage stack from scratch. And they also know it&#8217;s still a work in progress. But since there were too many valuable changes blocked by the adoption of Storage-ng, it was decided it was time to push the red button. So we are glad to announce the Storage-ng era has started with its inclusion in the first official (open)SUSE product &#8211; starting with snapshot 20180117, <code>libstorage-ng</code> has replaced <code>libstorage</code> and, thus, <code>yast2-storage-ng</code> has replaced <code>yast2-storage</code>.</p>
<p>They say forewarned is forearmed, so an article <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2018/01/09/future-tumbleweed-snapshot-to-bring-yast-changes/">was published in advance</a> in news.opensuse.org to set the expectations and to provide and overview of the current status. We would like to encourage all openSUSE Tumbleweed users to (re)visit the article to get a better picture of the situation.</p>
<h3>Alignment of partitions in the expert partitioner</h3>
<p>An important part of that work in progress is the re-implementation of the Expert Partitioner with Storage-ng technologies. As mentioned many times in previous posts, this is mainly a 1:1 clone, with the same functionality presented in exactly the same way than the classic YaST partitioner. But some times we take the opportunity to introduce some improvement here and there, as we did this week with a topic that can have a very noticeable impact in the system performance: partitions alignment.</p>
<p>Although many people is not aware of it, the partitions in a system must be properly aligned to avoid the performance drop caused by excessive read-modify-write cycles. For details please refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_alignment">great article at Wikipedia explaining the topic</a>, especially the sections titled &#8220;4 KB sector alignment&#8221; and &#8220;SSD page partition alignment&#8221;. Moreover, leaving performance considerations aside, some partition tables require alignment to simply work, like DASD partition tables which need alignment to tracks (usually 12 sectors).</p>
<p>The new expert partitioner takes all that into consideration when creating and resizing partitions, ensuring always the required alignment (like the DASD tracks) and encouraging the optional performance-related one, avoiding undesired gaps between partitions in the process.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/add_partition.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/add_partition-300x193.png" alt="Detail of the Expert Partitioner dialog to create a partition" width="300" height="193" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12963" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/add_partition-300x193.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/add_partition.png 626w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Above you can see the dialog for choosing the size for a new partition that, unsurprisingly, looks very much like the same dialog in the pre-storage-ng Expert Partitioner. If a size is specified by the user in that dialog (any of the two first options in the form), the start and end of the partition will be aligned to ensure optimal performance and to minimize gaps. That may result in a slightly smaller partition (with the difference being usually less than 1MiB). If a custom region is specified, the start and end will be honored as closely as possible, with no performance optimizations (although mandatory alignment, like DASD tracks, still will take place). This third option is the best to create very small partitions.</p>
<p>The same considerations for optimal alignment will also be taken into account while resizing an existing partition and calculating the minimal and maximal sizes suggested by the partitioner during that process.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/resize_partition.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/resize_partition-300x216.png" alt="Choosing the new size of a resized partition" width="300" height="216" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12964" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/resize_partition-300x216.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/resize_partition.png 464w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Sanity checks for the storage setup</h3>
<p>The possibility of bypassing the performance optimizations in the Expert Partitioner is just one example of the (potentially unleashed) power that tool provides. As a consequence of that flexibility, sometimes the user can overlook some important setup configurations or even make mistakes. To help with that, the Expert Partitioner recovered this week its ability to check the entered storage setup. </p>
<p>Once the user has set partitions, LVM volumes, file systems, mount points, etc. and decides to proceed, the Partitioner will validate that setup to ensure it fulfills all necessary requirements for booting and running the system. When some issue is detected, a popup message is presented to show what the problem is, offering the option to ignore the warning and move forward.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/setup_checks-1.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/setup_checks-1-300x207.png" alt="The resurrected partitioner sanity checks" width="300" height="207" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12966" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/setup_checks-1-300x207.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/setup_checks-1-768x531.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/setup_checks-1.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Two kind of checks are carried out to ensure the partitioning setup validity. First, the presence of needed partitions for booting is checked. Booting requirements depends on the current architecture (x86, PowerPC, AArch, etc.) and other technical details like the partition table type (GPT vs MS-DOS). Then, the mandatory volumes for the current product are checked. The mandatory volumes are defined in the revamped <code>partitioning</code> section of the control file. Typically, only a volume for root and another for swap used to be mandatory, but now this is totally configurable by anyone defining the product (SLE, Leap, Tumbleweed, your own custom openSUSE derivative&#8230;).</p>
<p>As a bonus, all the sanity checks are now centralized (they used to be scattered around the YaST source code) and it&#8217;s easier to add new ones (you will miss some old checks at this moment) and to use them from other parts of YaST (like the bootloader module or AutoYaST).</p>
<h3>More improvements in the Expert Partitioner</h3>
<p>The new warnings and the alignment improvements commented above are not the only news on the evolution of the Expert Partitioner clone this week. Resizing of LVM devices has also been brought back to life, both for volume groups and logical volumes. In the case of logical volumes, the functionality is not much different, at least in the surface, from the partition resizing that was already present and that you can see in the screenshot of the alignment section.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the context of the Partitioner, resizing a volume group actually means adding or removing physical volumes. Actions that are now possible again, including the corresponding checks. For example, a physical volume cannot be removed if it already exists on disk (that could destroy your data) or if the resulting size of the volume group is not enough to cover all its logical volumes.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/remove_pv.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/remove_pv-300x207.png" alt="Trying to remove the wrong PV" width="300" height="207" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12967" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/remove_pv-300x207.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/remove_pv-768x529.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/remove_pv.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Apart from the mentioned functionality, there has also been improvements in how the Expert Partitioner presents the information. For example, now the &#8220;type&#8221; column shows the correct label and icon for each device instead of that useless <code>TODO</code> label. Moreover, similar <code>TODO</code> marks were replaced by proper data in the device overview tab.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/no_more_todos.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/no_more_todos-300x207.png" alt="TODO labels are gone" width="300" height="207" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12968" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/no_more_todos-300x207.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/no_more_todos-768x530.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/no_more_todos.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Minimize changes between the SLE15 &#8220;Installer&#8221; and &#8220;Packages&#8221; DVDs</h3>
<p>The SUSE Enterprise Server 15 (SLES15) product can be installed from a bootable &#8220;Installer&#8221; DVD medium which contains the installer and a subset of packages needed for a very minimal system. The other packages are available either from a registration server (after registering the SLES product) or via a separate &#8220;Packages&#8221; DVD medium.</p>
<p>Due to the structure of those DVDs (with some packages being in present in both) the SLES installer was asking the user to change the medium several times during the installation process. Ideally the installer should use all packages from the &#8220;Packages&#8221; medium without changing the media.</p>
<p>In addition, there is yet another requirement for preferring the packages from the installation DVD to the packages available via a remote repository. Downloading a package from the internet is usually much slower than the DVD and can be problematic in network connections with a download limit or with a price based on the bandwidth usage.</p>
<p>Now the installer properly adjust the priority of all the repositories to achieve the desired behavior. To avoid possible side effects we decided to change the repository priority only when more than one repository is used and all repositories are local (e.g. DVD, hard disk, USB flash disk&#8230;). That means in some less common cases (2 DVDs + a remote repository) you will still need to change the medium but this is a safer solution.</p>
<h3>Add On products in AutoYaST</h3>
<p>For those using SLE Add On products, we have improved the error message if an Add On Product cannot be added during an AutoYaST installation. The user can see now which wrongly configured Add On Product has produced the error.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/autoyast_addon.jpeg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/autoyast_addon-300x231.jpeg" alt="AutoYaST reporting which Add On is wrong" width="300" height="231" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12969" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/autoyast_addon-300x231.jpeg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/autoyast_addon-768x592.jpeg 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/autoyast_addon.jpeg 971w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>This will be specially useful with the upcoming SLE15, in which the concepts of Add Ons and Modules will become more relevant than ever.</p>
<h3>Fixed a crash when shutting down the YaST user interface</h3>
<p>And now it&#8217;s time for the corresponding dose of technical insights for those who enjoy that part of our reports.</p>
<p>When <code>UI::OpenDialog()</code> and <code>UI::CloseDialog()</code> calls didn&#8217;t match when shutting down the UI (user interface YaST component), you&#8217;d get a segmentation fault with a core dump. Well, you <em>did</em> want to shut down YaST, but probably not like that. This is now fixed.</p>
<p>After tracking this down, it was surprisingly simple to reproduce: Just use the YaST version of the trivial &#8220;Hello, World&#8221; program and comment out the <code>UI::CloseDialog()</code> call.</p>
<p>This was a case of providing additional error reporting causing more problems than the original error: leaving dialogs open while terminating the program is an error, of course. But fixing this little problem by cleaning up the remaining dialogs lead to handling widgets after some of the underlying infrastructure (in this case the <code>QApplication</code>) was already destroyed, so all the QWidgets were also destroyed (because the QApplication takes care of that), but YaST&#8217;s generic UI layer was still unaware of that fact and tried to destroy them again.</p>
<p>This is now fixed by properly cleaning up the widget tree in YaST&#8217;s generic UI layer first which will also clean up the associated QWidgets so there is nothing left to clean up for the QApplication.</p>
<p>This might also fix a number of similar segfaults in other situations where the YaST Ruby engine would need to shut down because of other problems, e.g. when there is an unhandled Ruby exception.</p>
<p>Surprisingly enough, this must have been a very old (10+ years?) bug, but it never became quite obvious, or at least nobody was ever annoyed enough to try to track it down.</p>
<p>If you want even more details, check <a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1074596">the conversation in the bug report</a>.</p>
<h3>More to come</h3>
<p>The end of this sprint caught up with a lot of almost finished stuff. But following the Scrum principle of &#8220;nothing is done until it fits the Definition of Done&#8221;, we don&#8217;t blog about such stuff. Fortunately, that means the next report will likely be quite juicy. So, see you again in a couple of weeks!</p>
