		<description><![CDATA[sure. pdfimport wroks well in home on my 64-bit opensuse but in office I use 32-bit opensuse and got the memntioned error. so I digged the web for solution. The a.m. comment helped me to solve the problem. The most easy way for me is to 
1. download pdfimport.oxt
2. copy to /usr/lib/ooo3/ure/lib  (I have unzipped oxt and checked with &quot;ldd pdfimport.uno.so and&quot;, then I found that missing files are installed with ooo3 into &quot;/usr/lib/ooo3/ure/lib&quot; folder) - you&#039;ll need root access
3. intall the extention as ordinary user from &quot;/usr/lib/ooo3/ure/lib&quot;
That is all folk]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After a bit of digging I could solve the problem reported by Jordi.

Short version: you have to install OpenOffice_org-devel (670MB!) and the RPM containing libstlport_gcc.so, I coudn&#039;t find the latter in the opensuse packages, so I&#039;ve taken it directly from sourceforge:
&lt;code&gt;
rpm -ivh ftp://ftp.pbone.net/mirror/ftp.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/w/wi/witme/STLport-4.5.3-9064.i386.rpm
&lt;/code&gt;

Longer version: if you unzip the extension file (do it in a new directory, as it will create a mess of files in the current directory) you can run
&lt;code&gt;
ldd pdfimport.uno.so
&lt;/code&gt;
If you are experiencing the problem it will have a lot of undefined references, which prevent the library from loading. Track back the packages that includes the said libraries and it will work. Note that OpenOffice_org-devel does not put the library inside the library path, the path itself is extended is done somewhere inside the soffice wrapper. It means that even if you have all the libraries installed, running ldd will still show some missing ones; if you want to be sure you can redefine the LD_LIBRARY_PATH in order for ldd to find them:
&lt;code&gt;
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/ooo3/devel/solver/300/unxlngi6.pro/lib/
&lt;/code&gt;
but remember to reset it to the previous value afterwards, otherwise OOo won&#039;t work (crazy)!]]></description>
