		<description><![CDATA[Agreed.

I&#039;ve broken my SUSE twice because of interruption of this kind.

This feature is a nice one. Thanks Josef. I still think this should be part of YaST/zypp, if not default, at least with an option.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a yum user, I also call this a bug (and that&#039;s why there is a feature request about this).

The way that zypper does updates is still centered around users with no network and with a CD in their disk drive.

The size argument isn&#039;t one really, in my experience. I usually have some free disk space on some partition and can create a symlink to where there&#039;s room to cache the packages.

It is just a precondition that packages exist on the system for a dist upgrade - unless you want to risk the system. Anyone who would complain that about needing too much disk space might not be aware of the possible consequences of &quot;saving&quot; this disk space - and I&#039;m sure they would complain even more if the update breaks their system.

At the least, zypper could check for available disk space, and use it if it&#039;s there. If it&#039;s not sufficient, it could still offer to do a one-by-one update, downloading on the fly, after displaying a big fat warning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reason is that people complain that it eat to much space. If you do dist-upgrade it take around 2.5 GB, more or less depend on what you have installed...and some people restrict space for root and have all space in home. So default is not caching (also zypp (library under zypper) doesn&#039;t delete old package, this is planned to future).]]></description>
