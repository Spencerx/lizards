		<description><![CDATA[Interesting and cood to know information how this kind of prosess works. I tryed out Kubuntu 8.10 release and I new get it work on my two pc&#039;s (Intel and AMD). I took OpenSuse 11.1 Beta4 and both PC runs like sharm. Only OpenOffice wont work due to fatal Error. I just don&#039;t know where the error comes from. But anyhow, you can see that Suse has very good prosess to minimize fatal bugs and thats why Suse&#039;s betas works much better than other Linux distro&#039;s final releases! Bigest issue is the hardware combability and autoreconition of HW. Suse has still problems to get my LG 19LS4D-ZB monitor to work correctly on 1440x900 resolution. Now I have to use &quot;LCD&quot; monitor and 1400v1050 resolution to get it work. This seems to be issue on all distros.

Anyhow - keep working as hard you have - this will be a nice release someday!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Doesnâ€™t rebuilding all packages actually _hide_ ABI changes?

The rebuild will notice the API change at compile time - and not an obscure runtime error.  I don&#039;t understand your reference to ABI changes here.]]></description>
