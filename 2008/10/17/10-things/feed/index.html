		<description><![CDATA[A few months ago I installed 11.0 and it recognised all of my hardware and installed the correct drivers, including my Nvidia Ti4200 graphics card. I easily set up a compile environment and was very happy that this was the best distro I had tried.

But after a hard disk crash, reinstalling it to the same PC with a new drive proved to be a very frustrating affair.  I found it very difficult to find any help on why the graphics driver did not install, why the ones on the repositories were not working, why the screen resolution changed to something unuseable when I changed user/session. Why group root permissions did not work.

So far from being impressed, on this occasion I am so relieved to go back to use Windows XP - a stable, mature operating system that works. Should I have to say this? I thought Linux had come of age - it seems I was wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s good to see that you finally put something on the site for beginners. It would be nice if some of the first information that visitors find when they come to the website, or when their computer first starts up, is instructions for beginners on how to use it. openSUSE is the best Linux distro out there. But, it&#039;s an unfortunate truth that for most people new to openSUSE, if they don&#039;t know how to use it, what good is it (from their perspective)? If you don&#039;t know how to find anything, or install anything, is it even there to find or install (from the new-user&#039;s perspective)? When I sat down and really studied Linux, and became much more comfortable with using it, I really appreciated it much more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I came over to SUSE with 9.3 and I have never needed 3, 4 or 5. So I would drop those and add WLAN support and also dialup modem support for users in countries which don&#039;t have broadband.

The other seem reasonable.]]></description>
