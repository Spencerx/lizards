		<description><![CDATA[thanks bico. This tool looks like it could be used to replace the art too, with some work.

I&#039;ll have to try Rembrand against a Kiwi build, since the web site above seems to be working against a standard openSUSE DVD image, but I guess it should be the same or pretty close, since the Suse RPMs are all engineered to facilitate this script anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is perhaps a dumb (or easy) question: I know Novell insists that we remove the openSuse art for custom distro&#039;s based on openSuse, but is there a way to replace the standard upstream art with our own? For instance building a custom distro for a company, it would be nice to just replace all the &quot;Novell&quot; and Susie logos with the company logo...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for the articles! I am also interested in remastering the whole install DVD with new default values for the installation ex. different language, timezone, window manager, and to skip some of these settings completely during install. I have heard of a &quot;control&quot; file that can handle this, but I don&#039;t know how.]]></description>
