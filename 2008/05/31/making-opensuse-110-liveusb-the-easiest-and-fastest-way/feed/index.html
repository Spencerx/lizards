		<description><![CDATA[for 4 days ive tried to make this work using this tutorial but i cant..

here are my questions:
1) how would you know the syslinux -ma g:(in my case) is successful and the usb may boot now?
2) what OS are you using really during the processing of the image part? i dont remember windows got &#039;mount&#039; command

ive tried a couple of combination but im not successful. 

this is the straightest tutorial as i scour the net but i hope you can elaborate.

further, it would greatly help for a total noob like me if you  care to specify where are you (example: pc in windows c: prompt, in pc terminal or inside the usb already) when issuing commands.

thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi, thanks for the tutorial
but i am having trouble as to mounting the USB with the command &lt;code&gt;&quot;mount -o loop openSUSE-11.0-KDE4-LiveCD-i386.iso liveiso/&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
i am running winXP and cd to f: (my flashdrive) then executed that command, but it gave me the following error message:
&lt;code&gt;
&quot;&#039;mount&#039; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.&quot;.  
&lt;/code&gt;
is there additional program needs to be installed?  I am trying to create a bootable USB for the openSUSE 11.0 KDE4.  Thanks for the great help.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi , for this problem,
I redo the syslinux stage on windows.
After that, I get a file I didn&#039;t have before (with syslinux on linux). 
Then I redo all other stage, 
Now that&#039;s work.

Cheers,
condor1]]></description>
