		<description><![CDATA[Hi Luiz,

Thank you for confirmation. I&#039;m reading your reply to Coolo&#039;s thread &quot;Factory snapshot&quot; on opensuse-factory mailing list and appreciated the information, although *maybe* it won&#039;t be included in 11.0 release. If the tutorial at klik.atekon.de more easier than was provided by kiwi, people *should be* glad to heard your information ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

The &quot;work&quot; is not mine, but from the author of that page. I just find that his way is easy and if &#039;coolo&#039; make the initrd of LiveCD with the support of usb-storage, fat and vfat, it will be even easier as just extracting the ISO to USB and making the USB bootable (especially from windows users..)

regards,

Luiz]]></description>
