		<description><![CDATA[&#062; 7. Wireless LAN Network Manager come with the auto detect hotspot without any ‚Äúscan‚Äù button or something like that. I would personally encourage to add the 
&#062; button to make sure that we can refresh the hotspot list rather than waiting for nothing scanned

Good point ! Even Windows XP has it ( Show wireless networks / refresh )

Have you actually filed an Enhancement Bug to that end at bugzilla.novell.com ? If not please do so soon. Won&#039;t make it into 11.0 anyway but 11.1 is still possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vavai: &quot;Please don‚Äôt add the media check button.&quot; 

Why not? It&#039;s very handy to have especially when trying to troubleshoot CD/drive incompatibilities. For example, I&#039;ve had CDs that worked flawlessly on one system (the system I burned it from) and fail to load on another system. So, in this case, k3b and checksumming the image on the burn system would find no problems. Re-burning this CD at the slowest possible speed solved the problem.

For something that probably only takes a few minutes to implement, but can save hours of hair-pulling frustration, it seems silly not to.

&lt;b&gt;Please add a check media option to ALL bootable CDs.&lt;/b&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Please Update Firefox 3 beta 5 to firefox 3 RC in next Release of openSUSE 11 !

Unfortunately the roadmaps of Firefox and openSUSE didn&#039;t align well and so Firefox 3.0 missed the
last deadline of openSUSE 11.0 development for stuff containing crypto algorithms.
So it&#039;s not possible to update Firefox to another version before production of openSUSE 11.0 but as
soon as openSUSE 11.0 will be released we will deliver an online update to the latest shiny Firefox.
To always have the latest candidate of what will be released at that time you can subscribe to
the mozilla:beta buildservice repository which already has 3.0rc1.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Marcus,

Thanks for stopping by...

I write for about 2 paragraphs because my style in writing is describe all of the history ;-)

I know I can do the media check with k3b but I usually leaved this option unchecked for faster process in burn. off course it&#039;s the problem in my personal side but I&#039;m a luckily user before this one :-D

Thanks for the suggestion. Please don&#039;t add the media check button. The main reason why I choose the LiveCD is it&#039;s simple step for installing the media onto harddisk. Somebody maybe complaining if the media check option added to the LiveCD installation process ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just wonder why you wrote about two paragraphs a badly burned CD? Luckily the DVD has a &#039;check media&#039; mechanism. Perhaps we should add this as boot option for the LiveCD, too ;)
