Readers may also want to know how to download (1-click) Emerald themes from http://www.compiz-themes.org, and where to get skydome images, e.g. http://www.flickr.com/groups/equirectangular/pool/.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought about putting up a site on MySpace, or whereever, and providing information about my computer, along with step by step instructions and screenshots on how I installed and configured my computer with openSUSE. My computer, I believe, looks and works really nicely. So I would be helping others configure theirs the same way! Of course I would recommend buying openSUSE, and maybe give a disclaimer that it may not work on all hardware. I would also like to provide a link to an HCL. This would provide useful information to people who&#039;ve never installed openSUSE where an install fest may not be possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great way of promoting a distribution. What suse really needs now is a great forum to support the people using it. I hope that the new forums live up to the expectations. Take a look at ubuntuforums. It is openSource. I don&#039;t think they would mind borrowing some ideas.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Erik,

Thank you for the suggestion. I really appreciated.

The suggestion looks pretty interesting. Maybe I could write a regular review about compatibility hardware or a set of PC/laptop that worked out of the box with openSUSE.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a great effort.  What I would like to add is that reducing the frustration factor of things &quot;not working out of the box&quot; must be the biggest obstacle in reaching wide adoption.  Here are two ways to overcome the perception that opensuse does not work out of the box:

1.  Recommend system configurations that you know are very openuse friendly.  When I purchased my laptop, I looked at the exact system hardware that Lenovo used for its opensyse factory-installed laptops.  Then I found the exact same hardware combination in the &quot;refurbished&quot; section of the US Lenovo website and purchased one that has Windows XP on it.  I obtained a copy of opensuse 10.3 and installed it with dual boot.  In the end, it still took me a weekend to get it just right and my wireless still does not want to connect to open wireless networks, only my WPA network at home.
2.  Link out to the and support the hardware vendors who are making available factory installed linux . You can now buy a new Dell desktop or laptop with Ubuntu in the US.  You can buy a opensuse laptops or desktops from Lenovo.  I think HP has partnered with Red Hat.  So, there are lot&#039;s of choices, but the hardware vendors are not exactly advertising that they have these systems available.  At least that is the situation here in the US.  In any case, you can also benefit from reviewing and learning from the hardware selection they used in their new systems as I did.  In most cases you have to search google or the vendor sites to find these systems.]]></description>
