possibly help fix this problem, I&#039;m not a experimental user for openSUSE, all things done under the 11.O liveCD, Kiwi

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, 

Thank you for this tutorial.

But I have a problem when the USB stick boots.
 During the splashscreen.
 The computer is &quot;waiting for USB devices to settle................&quot; and after there is &quot;No USB stick found&quot;.
 Is anybody know what is wrong ?

Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re absolutely right. It&#039;s far too difficult to get openSUSE LiveUSB up and running atm. No newbie would install openSUSE to his harddrive to get it running on an USB stick, at least IMHO.
Coolo&#039;s approach is the right way from my perspective, although it&#039;s not working for me so far.

I think openSUSE LiveUSB would be a good way to attract newbies for the distribution
- it&#039;s damn fast
- it&#039;s persistent, so users could tinker much more with the system as possible with LiveCDs
- and of course, there is no need to touch the harddrive

Last but not least, USB installation should be possible from within windows as well.
Fedora&#039;s reference on this.. https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator

Just to throw in my 2 cents!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I know what the Fedora community (and also Ubuntu Team) offered is more simple and pretty much easier than what I mentioned at the tutorial above, that&#039;s why I&#039;m thinking some easy way to do same job.

Coolo has an experimental test with the easiest way (simply 1 line of bash command), but it looks like have some specific issue with USB stick.

Anyway, thank you for describing how to make a fedora liveUSB.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While this may be a working guide, it is far too complex for the average user. If you bother to compare it to Fedora&#039;s offer, you will find that openSUSE has a long way to go to hook users by means of live USB images.

Steps for Fedora ( from a running openSUSE 11.0 Beta3 installation )

1.) Download iso image from http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/9/Live/i686/Fedora-9-i686-Live.iso
2.) Open iso image with file roller and extract /LiveOS/livecd-iso-to-disk into directory where iso resides ( not necessary, but saves some typing )
3.) Install syslinux package ( zypper in syslinux )
4.) run livecd-iso-to-disk --overlay-size-mb 512 /path/to/iso /path/tousbstick ( adjust path/to/iso and /path/to/usbstick

If anything&#039;s amiss the script will tell you what to do.

The resulting bootable stick also has persistence, i.e. changes you make during a session will be preserved.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great guide :)

btw:
&#062; Make proper changes to usbboot config.xml files on /usr/share/kiwi/image/usbboot/suse-10.3/config.xml and replace following lines with your local repos :

Afaik that&#039;s not needed. The repository is marked as &quot;replacable&quot; and kiwi will fill in the right repository itself (at least this is how it works with the netboot configurations).
Otherwise you would have to create a new hash for this configuration]]></description>
