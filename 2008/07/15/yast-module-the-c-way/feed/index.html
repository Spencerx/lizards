		<description><![CDATA[Just a note: This module is not meant to be a &quot;test all my hardware and its drivers and report any issues&quot; module  :)

The &quot;System and Hardware Information&quot; is no addition - it is already in the current registration module. But it never showed the data that would be sent. We just seprarated the workflow into 3 steps to make it more intuitive and in order to show the user, what actions will be performed.

The hardware data is basically the output of &quot;hwinfo&quot; - just go to your current registration module (aka. &quot;Online Update Configuration&quot;) and click on &quot;Details&quot; to see, what commands would be run if you wanted to send hardware data. There are no tests if a piece of hardware is failing or a driver is missing, we just collect the data that hwinfo outputs.
The data is used for statistics so we get an idea what hardware is important to support in future releases.]]></description>
