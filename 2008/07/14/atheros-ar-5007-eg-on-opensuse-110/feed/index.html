		<description><![CDATA[I know its been awhile since I commented on this.  I needed a full day so I could play with the router and not affect the rest of the clan in the house.  I now appear to have wireless working.  Problem was that the router had MAC ID filtering and I didn&#039;t realize that the wireless card had a different MAC ID.  learned something today!

Thanks for all your help.  Perhaps the note about MAC ID is worthy of including in a troubleshooting support database faq?  Not sure who maintains that particular one, but perhaps someone could pass it on for me?

Thanks again]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Almost there!  I did as you suggested and I now get ath0 up.  Now I just need to connect to my WPA passworded wireless router.  I can see all the neighbours networks on Knetworkmanager.  I&#039;ve configured mine to connect to the home router and it looks like it gets 80-90% there but fails somehow. Any known WPA problems with madwifi?

Cheers and thanks alot for all your help with this.  So much appreciated

		<description><![CDATA[It sounds like ath5k won&#039;t go away no matter what you do.

One sure-fire way to kill it is to reinstall opensuse and enter &#039;brokenmodules=ath5k&#039; (without the quotes) on the boot line parameter; that way ath5k will never install to begin with.

Otherwise, I would use the rmmod command before attempting anything else.  Maybe try rmmod ath5k, rmmod ath5k_pci, rmmod phy0, then blacklist all of them, reboot, make sure no ath5k loads up, then install madwifi.  Then...

modprobe ath_pci
ifconfig ath0 up
iwlist ath0 scan

wlan0 is usually ndiswrapper and that should not be there.  remove any trace of ndiswrapper and use ath0 for madwifi.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hiya again,

after the kernel update I blew away the previously installed version (make uninstall &#038;make clean)

I then installed madwifi-hal-0.10.5.6-r3835-20080801

Tried blacklist +modprobe ath_pci reboot then  rmmod ath5k modprobe ath_pci 


Alas, still not much luck

dmesg &#124;grep HAL
dmesg &#124;grep ath_pci
dmesg &#124;grep ath5k
ath5k_pci 0000:07:00.0: registered as &#039;phy0&#039;
ath5k phy0: failed to resume the MAC Chip
ath5k_pci: probe of 0000:07:00.0 failed with error -5
ifconfig wlan0 up
wlan0: unknown interface: No such device]]></description>
