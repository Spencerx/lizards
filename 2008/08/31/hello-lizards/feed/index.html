		<description><![CDATA[Hello,

our October&#039;08 updated Enlightenment LiveCD will contain the following improvements:

1) OpenOffice-gtk theme match to the default gtk+ theme and switching to the default OOo branding
2) Addition of &#039;lxappearance&#039; and removal of &#039;gconf-editor&#039; for easy tweak of your gtk settings
3) Inclusion of the latest Xorg along with the latest Mesa (owners of ATI should appreciate it)
4) Fixes in the EFM&#039;s (Enlightenment File Manager) Drag&#039;n&#039;Drop operations
5) Current E-svn (it&#039;s a standard practice in our case but could be treated as a feature though)
6) New gimp (2.5.*) and updated image manipulation libraries
7) Improvements in the default fontconfig configuration
8) Inclusion of all updates except the kernel. Kernel will remain as it is.
9) Other minor improvements

We also want to know your opinion about LXDE. Should we include it as an addition to the LiveCD or as a replacement to the IceWM or just left things as they are?

Thanks!

P.S. we also started to contribute to the wiki:

If this it&#039;ll get a great amount of peers! I bet!

		<description><![CDATA[we shipped 17Tb-18Tb of traffic via http for less than 24 hours since the small announce on DistroWatch, no doubt that it&#039;s zero against the official releases. finally we have a torrent (HUGE THANKS TO ALL SEEDERS!) download option, we&#039;re looking for the friendly mirrors and it&#039;s clear that we&#039;ll find a way to get the desired bandwidth/storage sooner or later. 

it&#039;d be really nice if there&#039;s a way to include into the official OpenSUSE distribution the following E17 Core Base packages:
http://ftp5.gwdg.de/pub/opensuse/repositories/home:/dmitry_serpokryl:/Enlightenment-cvs-core-metapackage/openSUSE_11.0/E17_Base.ymp
total size of rpm&#039;s is about 10-12Mb. it&#039;d be great to have an option in installer: &quot;Minimal X system with E17&quot;

it&#039;s imho of course. i&#039;m glad to contribute to OpenSUSE and just hope that Community has benefits from my modest efforts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[seems like NAT of our ISP blocks the new torrent connections to the seeders PC&#039;s. unfortunately we don&#039;t have a dedicated &quot;direct&quot; IP address to seed the torrents. all we can do is to provide the empty .torrent files like this:
http://www.mininova.org/tor/1785446

but seed from our PC&#039;s/servers is impossible.

sorry for the inconvenience caused.
