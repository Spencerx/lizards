		<description><![CDATA[openSUSE 11.2 should be released along side the time line of KDE 4.3 which is scheduled to be released on the 30th of June 2009 and not use KDE 4.2.x.  This is being discussed in many suse / linux forums around the internet.  KDE 3.x should be dropped and packages that users may use should be placed on repo&#039;s or sites like Packman and not the CD/DVD.  Longer forward to 11.1 and SLED 11.  Keep up the good work. :)]]></description>
