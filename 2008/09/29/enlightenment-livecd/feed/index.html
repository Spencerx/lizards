		<description><![CDATA[hi,

1) Enlightenment Configuration panel (EC) is all you need here. Menu -&#062; Configuration -&#062; Configuration Panel -&#062; Applications -&#062; New Application (here you can create the .desktop file for any app with your custom parameters) and then just look a bit down and &#039;Startup Applications&#039; is a nice place for all apps (which has a .desktop files) you wish to start with E. 

2) well, &#039;Entrance&#039; is a bit different. We&#039;re using it as a default login manager for Enlightenment LiveCD and looks like we&#039;ll provide required modifications to set this thing. Right now we&#039;re just experimenting with the unification of X init for LiveCD and installed system and looking at the ways to improve the X startup/setup for our LiveCD. 

3) only one answer - please use a real filemanager like &#039;Xfe&#039;, &#039;Pcmanfm&#039; or any other favorite. EFM is intended to be very simple. it&#039;s great when you&#039;re browsing through pictures, .edj files, Drag&#039;n&#039;Drop documents to the editors (pictires to gimp for example) and so on. it has a simple pattern search when you start type something - it rushes to the similar file. and it&#039;s aimed to remain as simple as possible. it can rename your files, move, copy, delete, remember files associations. but there&#039;s no particular plans to overload it with the functions. sorry if it&#039;s not convenient for you.

regards.
P.S. all kudos - to Enlightenment Dev Team :)]]></description>
