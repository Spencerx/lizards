		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;We also gave away a lot of our new openSUSE Laptop stickers. The kind you can put over the one with the four color window/flag&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The openSUSE stickers are a great idea - but I have a better idea for the four color flag sticker than simply covering it. Remove it (a knive might help) and put it onto a place where it fits perfectly - see http://cboltz.de/en/devnull/ for an example ;-)

(You should have received a mail from me with a download link for photos to put on gallery.opensuse.org.)]]></description>
