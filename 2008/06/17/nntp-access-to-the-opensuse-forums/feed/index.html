Still, allowing that to a Webforum is something new :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ya you&#039;re right, I was thinking in a broader context which would need a redefined protocol: you&#039;d for example register at a Webpage which would have Webbased access to a mailing list and its archives. You could participate in the mailing list by three processes: subscribe by mail, by news reader or with a browser. You would need an secure protocol to authenticate with the news server with your login and password.

On the other hand: &quot;If you prefer not to have your real email address in your newsreader, you can use the following syntax for an email address in your newsreader: userid@no-mx.forums.opensuse.org and your user will still be recognized.&quot; will probably work better ^^ using an &quot;old&quot; and stable protocol :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;though some kind of secure NNTP if possible would be better?

Pedro,

Our goal is to make the openSUSE forums easily accessible to everyone so an open server is the best option.  There&#039;s really not much reason to have an NNTP server secure as you don&#039;t have to enter any private data into your NNTP client.  A good reference for you is in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.opensuse.org/faq.php?faq=novfor#faq_secpersnntp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Forum FAQ&lt;/a&gt; regarding securing personal information and the use of the NNTP interface.

&#062;Honestly Iâ€™m surprised more people havenâ€™t thought of that yet.

SSsshhhh! or before long EVERYONE will be doing it! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi!
I believe that&#039;s a great idea (though I don&#039;t use openSuSE so won&#039;t be using that for the time being).

Honestly I&#039;m surprised more people haven&#039;t thought of that yet.

IMO, if mailing lists and news servers could be interconnected would be even better. It&#039;d allow for non regulars to follow mailing lists when they had the time and when they didn&#039;t, they wouldn&#039;t be drowned by the thousands of messages mailing lists get (mail filters are great but you still have to download messages you won&#039;t ever read unless you have the trouble to unsubscribe...). That would also require a proper archive online, probably browsable by a Web browser.

Anyway, great idea :)

P.S.: though some kind of secure NNTP if possible would be better?
