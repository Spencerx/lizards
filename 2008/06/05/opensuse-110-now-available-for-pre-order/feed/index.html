		<description><![CDATA[Interesting point Mark. I don&#039;t know, I feel that it&#039;s kind of &quot;generic&quot; enough to appeal to both. My standard is if an average person sees it on the store shelves (which they won&#039;t, at least in North America :-( ), and stops to look at it, what will they think it is *without reading the text*, just the name? To me, the 10.x series boxes were more for the openSUSE community, with the giant lizard on it ;-). No one from outside the openSUSE universe would get the significance of that, whereas the guy in a chair with a laptop kinda shows &quot;OK, well it has SOMETHING to do with computers&quot;.]]></description>
