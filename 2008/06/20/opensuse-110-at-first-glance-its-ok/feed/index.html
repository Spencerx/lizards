		<description><![CDATA[Not having AIGLX default was one of the issues that annoyed me with 10.3.
Packagekit Updater seems to be at least better then the old gnome-updater - I hated it -.
By the way Firefox was just updated to final.

Here are the problems I have so far came up with:
Pulseaudio !!!! I have used it in Ubuntu, Fedora and this here seems to be the least polished. My sound delay was that huge in game that I just removed pulseaudio. It&#039;s not useable right now.

Packagekit seems buggy. I installed a local package with it and it installed nearly everything again. Also it will be confusion for new users. I mean common Yast2 - GTK -QT and packagekit. How do you tell somebody how to isntall packages if you have 3 default choices with suse ?

So far so good. Despite there facts opensuse 11.0 seems to be one of the best distros ever. I mean you find in every distro some things that are not good... but they thats linux. There is no perfect distribution. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I noticed LCD monitors that use a DVI connection again no longer work.  I thought this was fixed in Alpha2 but does not work in the gold finish.  I again am back to the black screen after boot which worked at least until RC1.  Now after installing gold final I am back to day 1 with no display.  Why we have this issue with DVI connections makes me question development since most cards made today are DVI and not AGP.  I have been using KDE 3.5 from the first alpha and this was corrected in alpha 2 and now it seems we are back to Alpha 1 again and it no longer works.  I really detest a black screen that tells me there is no connection between the display and the OS.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Intel problem + AIGLX can probably be solved by adding &#039;Option &quot;AccelMethod&quot; &quot;XAA&quot;&#039; to you /etc/X11/xorg.conf&#039;s device section, EXA doesn&#039;t work perfectly in that driver release yet

PackageKit is added to make things more unified across distros, so that you have to use a completely different tool on each distro.

I haven&#039;t seen you talk about libzypp&#039;s extremely fast speed though, that CAN&#039;T be overlooked, it was one of the few major problems that is now fixed. (Also PackageKit uses zypper on suse ;))

It does seem like it needs more polish, especially in PackageKit, and PulseAuido, lets see what fixes 11.1 will bring :)]]></description>
