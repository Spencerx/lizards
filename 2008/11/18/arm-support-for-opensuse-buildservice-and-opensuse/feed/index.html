		<description><![CDATA[Documentation:

We will set up some wiki pages on the whole thing.

QEMU status:

Help would be appreciated to improve QEMU quality for the Linux User Mode emulation. Currently, QEMU is under heavy rewrite, with the new code generators beeing added to it. Apart from ARM, QEMU is not very usable with the new things. That is also the reason why I did not talk about other Architectures like MIPS, sh4. If you have a solution here, please tell me. The packages for all that are in the OBS already. I build 2 versions of QEMU: one with the old gcc 3 compilers with old code generator in QEMU, and one for the new tcg that can be build with gcc 4.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[General update on openSUSE on ARM and OBS for ARM:

OBS for ARM:
We have merged this week the code for Cross Development in to the OBS Subversion repository. After all the dust of the combined OBS 1.5 and openSUSE 11.1 comes down, we will make an official OBS 1.6. For the build.opensuse.org OBS, we need to solve the issues of running QEMU User Mode in XEN. When this is solved, we are ready for ARM support in the official OBS.

openSUSE on ARM:
As from openSUSE 11.1 on, openSUSE distros will be build and released with the OBS. The same should hold true for the ARM versions of openSUSE. As a preparation, I will set up a testbase of existing ARM capable packages, since Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora have already working ports for ARM. Our goal should be to integrate changes into the Factory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes I develop for embedded systems i.MX27 ArmV5E EABI  Currently I use openSuSE 11.0/Eclipse for all my cross development but I run this thing with ATA interface 2Gig Flash USB 256Mbytes DDR. I have a keyboard and VGA LCD on my units. As you see we got put into the Kernel as of 2.6.27 /arch/mx2.  So you are talking about walking up my development tree.

Nothing could please me more than to help see openSuSE go native on my platform.

Cheers John]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wanted to give a status of cross development, especially what is currently working. We are trying to get also sh4, powerpc, mips running. But currently, the QEMU emulator is under heavy rework in the code generators, so I can&#039;t get the OBS worker or the build script running for these target environments. I give from time to time status to QEMU developers for that.

You can try to get feedback from QEMU developers on that, try to motivate them to work faster or you can yourself fix QEMU. I any case, it is not an easy effort...]]></description>

I&#039;m a developer for an embedded OS called pdaXrom. We&#039;ve been looking around to find a supported OS to port to ARM. If this gets anywhere im willing to assist in the project.
