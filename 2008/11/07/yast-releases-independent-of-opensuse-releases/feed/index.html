		<description><![CDATA[I am looking at this from the perspective of improving linux as a whole - sharing code and having less reinventing of the wheel, etc. That being the case, I think it is a good thing for all linux users to have access to YaST. Opening up YaST like this could eventually mean more people working on making YaST better. This, in turn, could theoretically allow openSUSE developers to apply their creativity in additional areas.

Already, I have some crazy hopes for where this could lead.
I wonder if KDE and/or GNOME could end up using YaST code for their configuration GUI.
I wonder if YaST could become the default administration tool for several distributions.
If KDE/GNOME used YaST for their admin needs, I wonder if a distribution could integrate their YaST code with the KDE/GNOME YaST code to form one powerful, well integrated, admin tool.

		<description><![CDATA[Just exactly who will be responsible for the cross threading of YAST plus any criticism that this will generate.  Getting other distros to work together has been one of the areas that Linux sorely lacks in.  The mentality of I created this and mine is better than yours has always been one factor of any consolidation into one major operating system within the Linux complex.  Could one imagine what could be created if some of the major players put their heads together and created a cross platform using the best of each and joined in furthering a major operating system.

Plus one factor is we would not want YAST to become a development nightmare like KDE has become.  One of the major problems with Linux is a new user becoming familiar with the file management system.  People coming into Linux from the other system are not use to having files in different areas and are use to them being consolidated under one program.  This is not a easy task for them to learn and having a program like YAST would improve the attraction to Linux operating system and SUSE.  Once they learn what YAST does and its ease of use it should generate interest from outside of SUSE.]]></description>
