		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got some suggestions for Xfce (packages could be found in X11:xfce Build Service project)
* replace Epiphany with Midori
* replace Evince with Evince-GTK

As you could&#039;ve guessed I think that you bring in lots of GNOME dependencies into your Xfce install. These could be avoided, but I&#039;m not sure I listed all changes that need to be done ... I&#039;d be glad to help with this investigation!]]></description>
