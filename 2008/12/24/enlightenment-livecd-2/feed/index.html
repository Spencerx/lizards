		<description><![CDATA[Please open E17&#039;s Settings Panel -&#062; Screen -&#062; Power Management. click the &quot;Enable Display Power Management&quot; option and set the desired timeouts. In 3.0.5 version we also include some power savings for harddisks.

Regarding FF - could you please refuse to install flash-player (or if it&#039;s already in just remove it by typing &quot;sudo rpm -e flash-player&quot; in console).

Suppose that &quot;gksu sax2&quot; could help to set both monitors, but unfortunately the dual/multi heads configuration is not tested through. We&#039;ll try to offer several templates and how-to&#039;s to help configure this, but manual editing of /etc/X11/xorg.conf is required in this case.

Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hullo again, I ran 3.0.4 live CD for a day or two and like the look and feel. One thing I noticed, is there no power saving included by default? On a ThinkPad with an external LCD screen attached both screens were on continuously. I didn&#039;t really investigate to check for any settings to control this behaviour, maybe there is something in YaST? Most distros I have run seem to turn off the screen(s) after a period of inactivity. Without any configuration of X for two screens, the system ran the external 17&quot; LCD with its native resolution of 1280x1054, and the laptop screen also at this resolution but not displaying the full area as on the large screen since the native resolution of the laptop screen is 1024x768.

I also noticed that Firefox seemed a bit unstable, it crashed after some hours of use, and then crashed again within an hour of restarting. I wasn&#039;t doing anything that should have stressed the browser too much, maybe half a dozen tabs running on fairly sedate websites.

Wireless connectivity was OK on this run with a WPA-secured access point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi gnomic!

1) mount of existing swap partitions will be fixed in version 3.0.5 . it doesn&#039;t work because we thought that some folks may use the sysrem as a recovery/rescue. we&#039;ll make it as a separate service with an option to turn it off for USB. for LiveCD this will be enabled by default on boot.

2) USB version is O&#039;k for sticks from 1Gb capacity and up. please read the instruction:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ftp5.gwdg.de/pub/linux/soad/usb-stick_images/usb_stick_readme&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;usb_stick_readme&lt;/a&gt;

all you need is (as root):
* backup your existing data
* dd if=./suse-11.1-Enlightenment-live-stick.i686-3.0.4_fixed.raw  of=/dev/YOUR_USB_DEV bs=32k

3) please try to restart service &#039;wicd&#039; if you can&#039;t connect (as root):
* rcwicd stop
* rcwicd start
* rcwicd status  # just a check

4) you can leave your comments here if it&#039;s o&#039;k for you. if not - we can offer other options:
* &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.enlightenment.org/comments.php?DiscussionID=278&#038;page=1#Item_0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;forum.enlightenment.org&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.opensuse.org/applications/388815-enlightenment-dr-16-dr-17-a.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Enlightenment openSUSE forum thread&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href=&quot;http://sda00.blogspot.com/search/label/Enlightenment-LiveCD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;my blod&lt;/a&gt;
* &lt;a href=&quot;irc://chat.freenode.net/#opensuse-enlightenment&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Freenode IRC channel where you can ask your questions online&lt;/a&gt;  (if someone from SOAD is there)
Welcome!

5) we&#039;re trying to reproduce the &quot; pause at ’starting HAL daemon’ &quot; case. need more input unfortunately. could you just type &quot;1&quot; as a response to &quot;automatic configuration&quot; question and wait a bit? 

6) USB-stick version still has one serious bug (our fault, in tech terms this is quite a stupid bug and will be fixed for version 3.0.5 and up): it runs o&#039;k only on a PC where you started it first time. to fix it just open as root the file &quot;/etc/init.d/create_xconf&quot; and insert into the 32-nd line (before &quot;case&quot; statement):

if [ -e /etc/X11/xorg.conf ] ; then
rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf
fi

another disadvantage - it doesn&#039;t have a man pages yet (will fix this too).

6) &quot;3.0.4_fixed&quot; for LiveCD added some packages like &#039;mtr&#039;, &#039;reiser4progs&#039;, &#039;iperf&#039;, etc. (sysadmin tools mostly) and fixed E17&#039;th &#039;places&#039; module issue. &quot;3.0.4_fixed&quot; for USB is a MUST (hell of a lot of changes).

Please note, that installed systems (on USB and HD) could be updated if online with a single command:

sys_update

hope it&#039;s clear that LiveCD will lost the updates on reboot.

THANKS for your feedback!

P.S. for USB looks like the best option is to wait the 3.0.5 fixes...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hullo there, glad to say I got 3.0.4 after many hours, sure the grass grew longer while waiting . . . and now omg I see I am out of date again already! Now just a few observations from brief use so far. CD booted on ThinkPads Z60m Pentium M (Intel 915 grfx) and T23 with 1133 MHz PIII and SuperSavage video. On both machines paused at &#039;starting HAL daemon&#039; during boot and required key press before proceeding. Doesn&#039;t pick up an existing swap partition on system, not essential obviously but a nice to have. Also doesn&#039;t seem to quit gracefully and eject CD, had to turn machine off. While using xfe file manager periodically throws up dialogue box &#039;Mount point /mnt/livecd is not responding&#039;. CD in fact not mounted according to mount command.

Was able to connect via wireless to open access point without difficulty. Connection to wpa-secured AP worked once, but on other occasions failed, seemingly with wpa-related problems. Could be cosmic rays I guess :-) Intel 2200 chipset.

Enjoyed using soad so far, and will explore it more. May try the usb stick version. I guess this will fit on a 2G stick? Any tinkering required to make the usb version bootable, or should simply copying the files across result in a bootable system? What is the best place to send further notes? The changes to 3.0.4-fixed mainly relate to Enlightment, or are there other changes besides?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;&#062; sorry if I was grumpy,

np, a gentle kick is always welcome :). please take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://soad.zenerves.net/iso/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ice Cube Mirror&lt;/a&gt; - it has version 3.0.4 &lt;a href=&quot;http://soad.zenerves.net/iso/suse-11.1-Enlightenment-live-iso.i686-3.0.4.iso&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.

&#062;&#062; maybe you could hold off from releasing a new version for 24 hours

well, i&#039;ll try that, but &quot;delta&quot; with a fix to the &quot;places&quot; module will be deployed definitely :).

hope you like the result or please don&#039;t hesitate to kick us once more if you find some bugs or just notice something that should/could be improved!

regards,
sda

P.S. i mean that you can use ‘aria2′ download utility to get the .iso from the mirror and download page at maximum speed (”…aria2 can download a file from multiple sources/protocols and tries to utilize your maximum download bandwidth…” - that’s from ‘man aria2c’)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hullo and thanks for your response - sorry if I was grumpy, it was just a bit of a pain when the file vanished during my second attempt to download. At the moment trying for 3.0.4 from scwlab site, but at present it is doing about 15 kbs with just under twelve hours indicated till completion. The mirrors don&#039;t seem to have the current iso. Unfotunately haven&#039;t been lucky enough to get a complete iso as yet so the delta won&#039;t help :-( Fingers crossed for better luck this time - maybe you could hold off from releasing a new version for 24 hours :-)]]></description>
