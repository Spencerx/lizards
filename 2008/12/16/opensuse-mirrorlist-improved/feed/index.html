		<description><![CDATA[RedDwarf, what can we do, when the mirror is not available for some time? It went offline yesterday. Our monitoring noticed that and disabled it in the database. Thus, we didn&#039;t send users there. 

We reenable it once it is available again. During that time, it is not listed of course. The mirror lists are updated every 30 minutes, so they automatically pick up changes.

It is very good that you report this (I think you did so also by mail, which even better!), because in this case I could reenable them already. If you check again, you should see them on the list.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How it is that ftp://ftp.rediris.es/pub/mirror/opensuse/ is mirroring a lot (everything?) but is not listed? RedIRIS is important (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RedIRIS), so I expect them to be doing a good work.
