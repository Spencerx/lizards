		<description><![CDATA[I really like that it shares the code with osc, our official command line client. 

Thanks a lot for this !

Btw, I was thinking about what the usecases for a GUI client are, I mean areas where it is better than the console client and the web client. I think, this area could be code browsing and merging. Simply because you want something better than a command line client for walking around all the submit requests and source changes (because you can syntax highlight sources for example).

On the other hand this client could prepare also code to be processed with other local tools on the workstation. For example opening the personal favorite editor for solving merge conflicts.

It is just an idea, but maybe you should think about if this is indeed an area where your client can have strength over the CLI and Web client.]]></description>
