Will try again with failsafe settings. My older acernote had problems with normal install (got Tomboy errors and firefox didn&#039;t work) but works fine with failsafe settings.

		<description><![CDATA[Just tried out the GM KDE LiveCD on my Lenovo S10e and found a bug or two:

1. Would not correctly select 1024x576 as the resolution, and Sax2 did not offer 1024x576 as a selectable resolution.
Bizarrely enough the Yast/Device Properties tab did recognise the screen as 1024x576, and yet the it booted into 800x600.

I would like Sax2 to at least offer me the option of 1024x576, if it can&#039;t detect it by default.

2. Kopete recognise the webcam as a &quot;Lenovo EasyCamera&quot; and yet there is no button to test the camera and the test image box just shows a green background.

It would be really nice to have the webcam work out the box.

3. I tried to use YAST to find out if my broadcom networking chips were correctly recognised and working only to be told that YAST cannot integrate with networkmanager.

Don&#039;t really know much about wireless gubbins as i have never had a netbook before, but it is a must have work first time on a portable device.

Hopefully these are minor config bugs that can be fixed before release, although i realise time is short.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Noticed same problem with GMC kde Live as my install of RC1 using DVD.
1st splash of openSUSE (green background) uses entire screen 15.4 WS, but when running from Live CD am only 15&quot; 4:3 thus about 1 &quot; wide black bars on BOTH sides of my LCD (also noted in comments 2008/12/13/Sneak-peek)]]></description>
