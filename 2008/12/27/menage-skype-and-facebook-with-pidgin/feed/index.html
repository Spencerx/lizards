		<description><![CDATA[Cool! I figured out a few months ago how to enable Facebook chat using the original project, but having it all packaged and nice is definitely quicker. Thanks for that!

I agree that the Skype plug in is a little useless, but I don&#039;t blame Andrea for that. More off, I blame Skype for not providing a plug in for Pidgin. That would be cool instead of running Skype separately, but either way it&#039;s nice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[facebook worked also before in pidgin and any contact list that i can run in another IM client for which i still need to run the original app, is plain useless. i&#039;m not against your work, but why would i want my skype contacts in pidgin if skype has to run anyway!!!??? a tip: utilizza spellchecker...ci sono un paio d&#039;errori...:-)]]></description>
