		<description><![CDATA[Just a comment, a new build (but with the same release string) has been made now with full released 42.2 + update

You perhaps have to force a reinstall of already installed FGLRX packages.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Vadym what you need was already existing in the raw-src.
The name is the same, the internal version has been increased.
You also need the amd-15.12-packaging-script.tar.bz2 which contains the support for 42.2]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ladislav, as you&#039;ve seen the AMDGPU-Pro is only available for newer card (I own none of them) so I can&#039;t try them, and also unfortunately there&#039;s no smooth instructions to build them in other systems than &quot;U&quot;.

I&#039;m not that much interested to spend spare free time on device/driver that don&#039;t care about my plateform.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a note: there is a new AMDGPU-PRO Beta driver (version 16.30) which supports only the latest cards. Unfortunately it&#039;s currently available only for Ubuntu 16.04 and 14.04 (see http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Radeon-GPU-PRO-Linux-Beta-Driver%E2%80%93Release-Notes.aspx).]]></description>
