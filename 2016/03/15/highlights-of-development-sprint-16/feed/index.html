		<description><![CDATA[Hi Paul,
we send all changes immediatelly to Factory expect storage reimplmentation, which will be used as replacement when ready. Of course before it reach TW it have to pass openQA and various checks.

So change in proposal should be already in TW. The system roles can be used, but need adaptation of opensuse control file where it have to be defined, so not visible yet.
installer self update is not yet in TW and what is more important for TW it doesn&#039;t make sense as DVD is always fresh enough, so probably opensuse release manager won&#039;t create such update repository at all.
And for consolidation of ci, we already have few modules that use jenkins instead of travis as Proof-of-concept, and plan is to continue with conversion and solve few features which disappeared after switch.]]></description>
