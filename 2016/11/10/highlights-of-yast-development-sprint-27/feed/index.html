		<description><![CDATA[Hi victorhck,

First of all thnx for your nice blog! ;).

Regarding to the hostname comment, you can set it by linuxrc just passing it as an installation option, Hostname=victorchk.opensuse.org. 

Currently we are working in some enhancements in the lan client, and as Ladislav commented if you have suggestions for example for the installation steps, Fate is the best way to request them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To the host name: I think that opening a feature request at https://fate.opensuse.org/ with a nice use case description can help to implement it... ;-)

To the live installer: Currently the Tumbleweed Live media (http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/iso/) run full installation from network. So it actually behaves like a big NET installation medium. AFAIK there are no plans to change that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[it&#039;s great to see how YaST it&#039;s being improving a lot!!

I will ask a feature in installer: I would like that during installation thw installer ask to user about name host.
Then when you have finished the host is setup, and it&#039;s not necessary to go and setup by yourself :)

just and offtopic! :Ã¾
