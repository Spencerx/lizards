		<description><![CDATA[This was not my decision to make, no official live media means we cannot base Li-f-e on anything. I do not maintain live medias and live-installer or am interested/capable of doing it. I still cannot find references for any yast2-live-installer bugs that were not fixed for many months and the bugs I&#039;ve linked to were bugs elsewhere being exposed by the live-installer.

In our discussion I agreed to set up 42.1 PromoDVD image: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Education/openSUSE-PromoDVD
and someone else will take it up from there, I would of course help maintain it if needed. Apologies for not being able to do more. Hopefully if there is any interest in openSUSE live medias, this post will get someone from wider openSUSE community to step up and take it forward.

So there is still some hope for openSUSE Edu Li-f-e if 42.2 has live-installer in well tested working order and officially supported.

Edit: Apart from reporting/fixing/workarounds bugs, have also submitted many fixes to live medias: https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/357822, https://build.opensuse.org/package/revisions/GNOME:Medias/gnome-next-live?showall=1

Richard, it bothers me that you say &quot;Except that you didn‚Äôt&quot; in the face of evidence provided :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Except that you didn&#039;t - you were in conversations with our Leap Release Manager about making official LiveCDs. Last I heard you had his full support, and we were just waiting on you to drive it forward.

The live-installer is still available in a devel repo, just not in the official Tumbleweed repos because it was broken for months, resulting in installs which did not work (as tested by openQA) and no one was fixing the issues.

It&#039;s really disappointing Jigish to see you making this decision when you were empowered to resolve the matters in openSUSE you claim as justification for this decision..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did, see: https://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2014-08/msg00048.html and https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Education/openSUSE-PromoDVD

Also something being important does not automatically translate in programming expertise needed to fix low level stuff :)

BTW, last bug report I see from 15th of last month show live-installer works fine, so not sure why it is dropped.

		<description><![CDATA[BTW have you read about GeckoLinux?
It&#039;s a openSUSE spins, maybe you can do something similar with SUSE Studio
- https://geckolinux.github.io/

One of their motivation is: &quot;There is currently no official installable live media for openSUSE Leap 42.1.&quot;

&#039;ve phun!]]></description>
