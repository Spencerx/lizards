Currently in my ATI Radeon R5 I&#039;m running fglrx with that last release. I downloaded the rubber from AMD in tar format and I installed it from scratch waiting it could have the Crimson version and the new Radeon settings software but SURPRISE, still Catalyst and fglrx remained.

		<description><![CDATA[Hello all,

@Bruno: Thanks for providing us the formerly fglrx driver.

I am currently working on repackaging of AMDGPU-Pro 16.50 (SLED 12 SP 2) for openSUSE Leap 42.2 with a rewritten makerpm-amdgpupro python script from scratch.

The bad news:
Unfortunately AMD has forgotten packaging 32-bit libraries (I have already report it to AMD). So I use temporarily the 32-libraries from Ubuntu 16.04. The default openSUSE kernel does not work with my graphics card. So I should installed Kernel 4.9 from Kernel repo because I have a Radeon R9 290X (Southern Island architecture).  :-(

The good news:
Open-Source 3D-Games with OpenGL is working. 3D-Games from Steam is working. OpenCL is working. Hardware video acceleration based upon VDPAU is working. Performance is really really very good. ;-)

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the uncountable hours of service!I have mostly used Nvidia.Great! But, several of my machines have Radeon. Proliant Microserver with a 4225 card was workable with the 12s and 13s. Always a pain though. Finally added a 6245 card and was able to run it at a resolution greater than 1024. Happy so far. 

I also emailed AMD in November letting them know that if they cannot support us linux users, we will no longer support their pruducts. I just hope that theywork in conjunction of equating their drivers to our releases. SuSE has always had problems with video. Since i started using it in ver. 6.1 it has been one thing or another. Oh well, love it, or leave it. Heck, I love it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seems like this also doesn&#039;t really matter thanks to the SLES/SLED 12 sp2 support that others have mentioned.  If you look at the installer script, you&#039;ll see it supports OpenSUSE.  More importantly it installs and seems to work just fine.  So AMDGPU Pro drivers are being released properly (as properly as proprietary gets anyway) from AMD themselves.  Hurray!  More hurrays coming when everything is on an open source stack, upstreamed, save for a few closed userspace bits... maybe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are not understanding correctly about what GPU&#039;s I am talking about and that also explains the rest of your answer. The HD2x to HD4x is the first generation Terascale architecture. These cards are no longer supported by current Fglrx drivers. There is also the second generation and third generation Terascale architecture.

Many GPU&#039;s in the HD7000 and HD8000 series are using a Terascale architecture:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon_HD_7000_Series
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon_HD_8000_series

These GPUs are less than 5 years on the market and therefore a lot of them are still in production.

Second and third generation Terascale GPUs very much depend on Fglrx because they give very competitive performance with Fglrx in such a way that even many modern games can be played, while on the open source driver side, the majority recent progress has happened on the RadeonSI driver for GCN cards, while Terascale cards (r600 driver), has by far not seen the same progress, and still gives subpar performance. Other stuff like OpenGL 4.5, OpenCL, Eyefinity monitor support, all works perfect on Fglrx, and not on r600.

Now it is absolutely true that Fglrx is a dead horse, so not bad word for dropping it. But at the same time, for owners of Terascale cards, the advantages of 42.2 are mostly likely not big enough accept severely decreased graphics functionality. Therefore I expect this will cause some users not to upgrade and stick with older distributions. Wether or not a new Evergreen happens depends on demand, but these decisions contribute to such demand.

As for the time how long the repo would need to be available, I can&#039;t make financial trade-offs, but I propose to look at the economic life of a computer. Let&#039;s put the economic life of a computer at 5 years. The final Terascale cards were introduced in 2013. Allowing users of those computers to run (some version of OpenSuSE) during this economic life period, would mean that the repositories would need to be available until somewhere in 2018.]]></description>

<p>These GPUs are less than 5 years on the market and therefore a lot of them are still in production.</p>
<p>Second and third generation Terascale GPUs very much depend on Fglrx because they give very competitive performance with Fglrx in such a way that even many modern games can be played, while on the open source driver side, the majority recent progress has happened on the RadeonSI driver for GCN cards, while Terascale cards (r600 driver), has by far not seen the same progress, and still gives subpar performance. Other stuff like OpenGL 4.5, OpenCL, Eyefinity monitor support, all works perfect on Fglrx, and not on r600.</p>
<p>Now it is absolutely true that Fglrx is a dead horse, so not bad word for dropping it. But at the same time, for owners of Terascale cards, the advantages of 42.2 are mostly likely not big enough accept severely decreased graphics functionality. Therefore I expect this will cause some users not to upgrade and stick with older distributions. Wether or not a new Evergreen happens depends on demand, but these decisions contribute to such demand.</p>
<p>As for the time how long the repo would need to be available, I can&#8217;t make financial trade-offs, but I propose to look at the economic life of a computer. Let&#8217;s put the economic life of a computer at 5 years. The final Terascale cards were introduced in 2013. Allowing users of those computers to run (some version of OpenSuSE) during this economic life period, would mean that the repositories would need to be available until somewhere in 2018.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Just to be precise for readers, you cite terrascale, but the fglrx drivers was already (since a long time : February 2013 with openSUSE 12.3) available only for HD5xxx and above.

The mass you describe was HD2x to HD4x mostly, and those have already moved to free and open source driver.

The other point : need another evergreen ? Don&#039;t get silly, asking in one things, doing is another one. And we don&#039;t get the expected contribution for evergreen (even if it was successful).

Same you ask to keep the repo, but how much time, and with which money?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t it is good idea to already remove the repository. Fglrx is still the best option for people with cards based on AMD&#039;s Terascale architecture, they are getting dated, but a lot were sold, people don&#039;t always install Linux on the latest hardware, so a lot of those cards are still in use. It means 42.2 will not be a good choice for those people. Some will upgrade their hardware, some will stay on older OpenSuSE, an Evergreen, if 13.1 is phased out, there will be demand for a newer Evergreen. Having the repository available makes then a lot of sense for them.]]></description>
