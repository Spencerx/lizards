		<description><![CDATA[yes you are right, that time i was working with bumblebee for 2 hours and i was very tired sorry.
i mean it is good if opensuse have just gui program for drivers to install and it can automatically recognize  optimus and offer some drivers for installing to user and when user installed nvidia driver simple icon appear on the menubar for changing between intel and nvidia 
.
thanks for answer]]></description>
