		<description><![CDATA[There is one feature I&#039;d like to see in partitioner: &quot;Apply now&quot; button.

Many times, when playing with disks and partitions, I have come to a point where I would like to just apply whatever I was doing before and then continue to do some more changes (like delete everything before creating new). I know that I can just click &quot;Finish&quot; and restart the partitoner, but ... you know, two steps less... 

Thanks, and keep up the good work.
