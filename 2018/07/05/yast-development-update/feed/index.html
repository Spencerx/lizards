		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting and informative.
Will want to see these changes, can&#039;t wait.

But, 
Would like to see...

You new semi-graphical way of using a button to move a proposed new partition to the beginning or end of free space... I hope that the operation is done without detail, I doubt that the average user will care about cylinders or sectors.

Also,
I find your description of the UEFI vs MBR when a bootloader already exists interesting, but is it sufficient or complete? It&#039;s my understanding that the problem is really &quot;MBR vs GPT&quot; and that GPT supports a mixed mode of both UEFI and MBR although most people think that if you have a UEFI boot (typically because they&#039;re multi-booting Windows) that they also need to install openSUSE using UEFI... which shouldn&#039;t be true.

Bottom line I guess is that the Installer should guide the User to configure what is supported for a problem-free experience, but somewhere it should be noted if the Installer is lacking in some kind of capability that is not consistent with published RFC. And, if a certain selection will likely lead to a bad result, I would expect that something stronger than a &quot;very&quot; strong warning is displayed.]]></description>
