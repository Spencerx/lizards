		<description><![CDATA[Ben okay, so you are hit by the discrete gpu ( intel + ati gpu mixed ) 
Normally things should work, but I can&#039;t be sure with that, and it&#039;s the hard part of the driver.

There&#039;s two way, if possible disable the intel gpu part in the bios (some hardware allow that, some not). Then you will use only the fglrx part, but this will drain a bit more your battery.

Otherwise Sebastian has a nice script collecting all the related stuff, that can be send to him
(freespacer on irc, or check his blog )
like running su -c &#039;sh makerpm-amd-12.2.sh -ur&#039; and posting back the given url or result]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just installed the fglrx driver, and it works like a charm, but...
Sebastian&#039;s script didn&#039;t work out for me (opensuse 12.1 with radeon 4650), clean install and i started again, now with the rpms from Bruno. 

What you should do, is follow the steps as explained on http://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=6680

So for 12.1, change any reference to 12.1, and change the url to the repo as well (see Bruno&#039;s comment of march 27)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey thanks for the help Bruno!

I followed your instructions, namely adding the 64 bit repository to zypper (which matches the distribution architecture) and installing from there. It seems I am now getting a segmentation fault when I try to launch Xorg using this driver, as well as a line suggesting this is the incorrect driver.  Perhaps the spec sheet on the Lenovo U400 is wrong?  Here are the offending lines from the Xorg log:

[    16.331] (II) AMD Video driver is running on a device belonging to a group targeted for this release

Do you have any suggestions?  I&#039;m sort of at a loss when it comes to these sorts of issues.  Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ben, yesterday I pushed the new build release 8.950-3 on the mirror and fix a misplaced file.
Using the ati .run installer without including some of the work done by sebastian, you will certainly have trouble.

So the best way for you should be : use the .run to uninstall all what it can have installed.
Remove any /etc/ati you could have.

check if the one-click as installed a repository with 
zypper lr -d 
If the one click doesn&#039;t work you could do it manually easily by issuing 
zypper ar -f -c -n &quot;FGLRX&quot;  http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/ati/openSUSE_11.3 FGRLX 

You should have 
FLGRX pointing to http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/ati/openSUSE_11.3 as url
then in console mode after a reboot, add in the boot line : nomodeset blacklist=radeon 3 
and use zypper in fglrx_xpic_SUSE113 (if you are 32bits) or
zypper in fglrx64_xpic_SUSE113 under x86_64 installation 
should do the trick.

In case of error have a look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log to find any clue of trouble.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Bruno,

I&#039;m trying to install the video drivers for openSUSE 11.3 onto a lenovo U400, which according to the specs has a AMD Radeon™ HD6470M video card and requires the 64 bit catalyst 12.2 / fglrx 8.950 driver.

You might have made a typo on your &quot;one click install&quot; link, as it doesn&#039;t work for me.  Did you mean to fix this?

I was hoping this would successfully install, as compiling following the README included with the driver from AMD&#039;s website leaves me with a system that hangs when trying to start xorg.

Thanks!]]></description>
