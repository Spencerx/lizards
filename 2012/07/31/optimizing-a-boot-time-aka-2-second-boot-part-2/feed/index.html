		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m trying for a while to cut the boot time. What I think it needs to be done is to start the minimal services that needs to get to the login (like you did). The rest of the services like  networking and so on can be started in background after with a low (maybe distinct) priority and maybe only if they are needed... And not work with a &#039;cut down system&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just found that the 3 different available syslog services (one can easily install via yast) make a huge difference of up to 4 seconds. The best is syslog-ng:

syslogd
  5876ms nfsserver.service
  2129ms syslog.service
  2112ms systemd-logind.service
   754ms md.service
   504ms SuSEfirewall2_setup.service
   142ms SuSEfirewall2_init.service 5,6

rsyslog
  4826ms nfsserver.service
  2144ms syslog.service
  2129ms systemd-logind.service
   726ms md.service
   492ms SuSEfirewall2_setup.service
   169ms SuSEfirewall2_init.service
 
syslog-ng
  4915ms nfsserver.service
   728ms md.service
   494ms SuSEfirewall2_setup.service
   167ms syslog.service
   165ms SuSEfirewall2_init.service
   165ms systemd-logind.service

syslog-ng (second restart)
  5874ms nfsserver.service
   737ms md.service
   495ms SuSEfirewall2_setup.service
   166ms SuSEfirewall2_init.service
   156ms syslog.service
   142ms systemd-logind.service

Now I have: 3641ms (kernel) + 10314ms (userspace) = 13956ms]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[very well done!
Could you also provide info on how to mask services from systemd?
thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[way cool. This inspired me to go through my own laptop bootup list as well. A few notes:
- systemd-analyze doesn&#039;t install on openSUSE 12.2 rc2, complains about dependencies
- making initrd smaller is really hard. I looked in it - darn, there&#039;s some weird stuff in there. Yes, there are splashy and plymouth. But also libxml2 (1.4 mb) libgio (1,.3 mb), LibX11 (1.2 mb), libcairo (1 mb) and things like sqlite, libcups (!?!?!) and much more. why is that there?!?!? My kernel boot time is often 7 seconds - on a total of 10... :(
- I greatly dislike that removing some things I really don&#039;t need (lvm2, mdadm, some crypt stuff) removes half my system - at least, most of YaST, including stuff like the bootloader configuration. That should really be cleaned up...
- I now have this beauty slowing down my boot:  6881ms laptop-mode.service  --- wtf?!? Seems the culprit there is re-mounting my filesystems with relatime (which I&#039;ve already set to noatime anyway). I solved this in the laptop-mode config, disabling its control over my drives.]]></description>
