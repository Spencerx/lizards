		<description><![CDATA[Now I see that QT4 isn&#039;t even loading the &quot;required&quot; files. Geesh guys -- no credit to you. The people raving for you must not be doing anything of significance or making some super Files System Arrays with RAID/LVM or VM&#039;s. OpenSuse is not ready for primetime anything. Might be &quot;Ok&quot; for a hobbyist who wants to spend most of their lives messing with a broken OS. I remember the days I used to spend weeks to months on a distro trying to get it to work and then would always have to go back to Windows XP/Win2008/Server or a Windows 7 creation. I&#039;ve figured out how to go head to head with any Linux Distro and beat it hands down and I intend to get Steve Balmer back on the wagon in commercials and compare the two OS&#039;s. Linux is good for crashes and losing data. Windows is good for doing all your work that Linux will break and lose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry for openSuse AGAIN!!! Ok -- the no brainer -- there is no MP3 built in YET!
Next -- 3 drives away from the root/boot opensuse takes away all permissions to do anything to any file that is copied into a VolGrp00/logvol00 and even after giving complete permissions -- there is still nothing. You can see the file is there but you can&#039;t see the content. SuSE used to be my main Linux distro from 1993 till version 10.3 was duped out of time. Now opensuse has done a great job of making something that is completely useless unless all you want to do is write a few documents or listen to a few flash videos. Just like Mandriva -- OpenSuse is now a permissions useless OS of nothing. I&#039;m going back to Windows 7 Professionalism that works not only 5 drives down line -- but, I can put RAID anywhere and permissions wherever the hell I want to. OpenSuse is only good for 1 hard drive and a very small setup footprint of folders. Works really well as long as a person doesn&#039;t make it do mp3&#039;s or go off the boot drive to a 2nd physical drive. Ubuntu would be better if it could be trusted not to dump the Filesystem (ext4 or whatever else). I&#039;ve lost so many gigs of data to Ubuntu before finally giving up on it&#039;s ability to hold a Filesystem in place and now I see OpenSuse isn&#039;t much better. Microsoft is a better system. I can prove it any day of the week. Make Linux work on more than 2 drives and it dies.  Turn off the computer too many times and it loses it&#039;s Filesystem. You can turn off Windows XP and Win7 till the cows come home and you never lose your Filesystem.]]></description>
